0,2025-03-17,DOGE Is Making It Harder to Track Extreme Weather. What Could Go Wrong?,"The agency’s scientists help build the forecasting models used to predict what the weather will look like next week, and what your children’s climate might look like half a century from now. Farmers use the agency’s weather data to plan their crop planting and harvesting, and urban firefighters rely on it to anticipate high wind events and prepare for downed power lines and evacuations. But staffing reductions at NOAA’s National Weather Service offices have suspended the launch of weather balloons that collect wind, temperature and humidity readings from Alaska to Albany.

These cuts threaten your budget, too. Insurance companies rely heavily on data gathered by NOAA and the U.S. Geological Survey to assess wildfire, flood, wind and other risks. Some firms are warning that any interruption in data availability could drive insurance premiums for customers even higher. Other layoffs at the U.S.G.S. could undermine programs that monitor drought and flood conditions, hazardous spills and sewage overflows and the health of salmon fisheries off the Pacific Coast.

And then there’s air pollution. On March 4, the State Department announced that it would no longer share data gathered by air quality monitors at more than 80 U.S. embassies and consulates around the world. With that decision, another one of the government’s most effective global monitoring efforts went dark.

Since the first air quality monitoring system was installed atop the U.S. Embassy in Beijing in 2008, the initiative has yielded a huge return on a modest investment by simply telling people what they’re breathing. During a particularly severe air pollution episode in November 2010, the Beijing monitor tweeted an automated message that air quality in the city had reached “crazy bad” levels. The programmers had written that message in jest, assuming that it would never be triggered because pollution levels would never get that bad. The tweet prompted news stories around the world, and the intense scrutiny helped compel China’s leaders to act. Fifteen years later, China’s air is much cleaner.

From Lagos to Karachi, U.S. Embassy monitors were among the only reliable sources of information about what residents were inhaling every day. One 2022 study found that the air quality readings triggered local policies that substantially reduced particulate matter concentrations, leading to reductions in premature deaths and saving an average of $127 million per city each year. The State Department cited “budget constraints” as the reason for shuttering the program. But the researchers found that the program saved the State Department money — it more than covered its costs by reducing compensation for embassy workers’ pollution exposure.","NOAA’s National Weather Service offices have suspended the launch of weather balloons that collect wind, temperature and humidity readings.

1,2025-03-16,Severe Storms and High Winds Move Into the East Coast,"Deadly severe weather that spawned tornadoes and dust storms across the Midwest and South arrived on the East Coast on Sunday, bringing with it powerful winds and the potential for tornadoes across the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast.

The turbulent weather, which has killed a total of at least 40 people, has caused widespread destruction.

It is part of a huge cross-country system that dropped hail — some as large as baseballs — and produced tornadoes Friday and Saturday that killed at least 24 people. The system also caused wildfires driven by hurricane-force winds, and dust storms that led to crashes that killed at least 16 people in Kansas, Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.

On Sunday, the threat of tornadoes and thunderstorms shifted east, though at a level much lower than it was on Saturday.","At least 40 people have been killed across the U.S. by severe weather.

By Thursday morning, the heaviest rains had shifted out of Los Angeles County and into Orange County, though showers and isolated thunderstorms were expected to linger through Thursday afternoon. Rose Schoenfeld, a meteorologist at the Los Angeles office of the Weather Service, warned that the risk of flash flooding and debris flows would persist.

“The thunderstorms could produce flash flooding impacts, gusty winds and small hail,” Ms. Schoenfeld said. “But overall, the main part of the storm has exited L.A. County.”

Thousands of people in Los Angeles County were driven from their homes by wildfires two months ago. This week’s storm system was the second in a month to set off a cascade of intense preparation as traumatized fire survivors and state and local authorities rushed to prevent the fire-stripped soil from turning into a slurry of muck and debris and sliding out from under remaining homes, roads and buildings. A similar storm in mid-February generated several minor debris flows and at least a dozen close calls, including that of a Los Angeles fire inspector whose vehicle was swept off the road and into the Pacific Ocean by a mudslide near Malibu.

County, urban search and rescue teams and swiftwater rescue teams worked to support 12 flood related incidents. One incident included a LAFD member who was swept off the road and into the ocean near Malibu., but the proactive response prevented significant damage or injuries.","The Weather Service issued multiple flash flood warnings throughout the night and into Thursday morning.

The blimp, which was about 200 feet long, broke free from its tether just after 3 p.m. Monday during a “severe wind event,” the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Air and Marine Operations division said in a statement. Maximum wind gusts were around 30 miles per hour that day, slightly stronger than normal, said Ben Ellzey, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Brownsville.

Operators lost contact with the white blimp shortly after it became loose, according to the statement. The agency asked residents to report any sighting of it.

According to the Air and Marine Operations division, Quinlan Texas Fire and Rescue found the blimp on Tuesday in Hunt County, about 30 miles east of Dallas.","The blimp broke free from its tether in South Padre Island, Texas, on Monday.

The group was working on the Srisailam Left Bank Canal tunnel project in the southern Indian state of Telangana, a decades-long effort to build one of the world’s longest irrigation tunnels, which has been plagued by a series of delays since construction began in 2005.

The workers were about nine miles inside the tunnel on Saturday morning when the roof collapsed after a rush of silt and water, according to local officials and news reports. Some escaped, but eight were left trapped behind a tunnel-boring machine that blocked their exit.

“Water gushed in and the roof caved in,” Manoj Gaur, the chairman of Jaiprakash Associates, the Indian construction company that is co-managing the project, said in an interview. “The tunnel is a big tunnel with a diameter of more than 10 meters. Imagine most of that height being filled with water, stone and mud.”",Eight workers believed to have been trapped in a collapsed tunnel for several days.

5,2025-02-18,Climate Aid Projects Fighting Extremism and Unrest Are Closing Down,"Numerous programs aimed at averting violence, instability and extremism worsened by global warming are ensnared in the effort to dismantle the main American aid agency, U.S.A.I.D.

One such project helped communities manage water stations in Niger, a hotbed of Islamist extremist groups where conflicts over scarce water are common. Another helped repair water-treatment plants in the strategic port city of Basra, Iraq, where dry taps had caused violent anti-government protests. U.S.A.I.D.’s oldest program, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, ran a forecasting system that allowed aid workers in places like war-torn South Sudan to prepare for catastrophic floods last year.

The Southern California areas scorched by flames last month had been of particular concern because the soil in those areas can repel water and allow sheets of mud to race downhill and collect debris along the way.

As the brunt of the storms arrived on Thursday afternoon, the National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings in Malibu and Pacific Palisades, two communities that suffered heavy damage during the Palisades fire last month. Shortly thereafter, the Weather Service issued the same warning in the Altadena area, where thousands of structures were destroyed by the Eaton fire, and across much of Los Angeles County, affecting about seven million people.

Hours later, my husband and I stood in the NICU, looking down at this newborn baby, hooked up to wires and tubes.

We had spent months talking about how to protect him from various harmful influences, and here we were, an hour out of the gate, dealing with a situation we hadn’t even considered. Had his brain been deprived of oxygen for too long? Would there be lifelong damage?

Safeguarding the nation.

In 2021, President Biden ordered the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security to study the security implications of climate change and to incorporate them into defense strategy and other national security plans.

In response, the Pentagon, Homeland Security and the intelligence community detailed how food shortages could lead to social unrest, how countries may fight over dwindling water supplies and how people would flee climate shocks in places like Latin America, increasing migration to the United States.

12,2025-01-16,We Have to Stop Underwriting People Who Move to Climate Danger Zones,"In theory, insurance prices quantify the risks of living in a certain place. Of course it should be more expensive to insure a home in an area buffeted by disaster. But in practice, states vary widely in their willingness to allow insurance premiums to increase, with some making it far harder than others for insurers to raise prices. California is one of the most resistant, and until recently refused to let insurers raise premiums or reflect climate-catastrophe risks in their pricing.

Insurers doing business in such heavily regulated states, finding themselves unable to raise premiums when needed, wind up shifting some of the costs to homeowners who happen to live in states that are more accommodating to premium increases. That is, in part, how middle-class communities, such as Enid, Okla., can end up subsidizing the owners of million-dollar houses in Malibu. And under our current regulatory regime, that dynamic is only expected to strengthen as climate losses continue to cut into insurance companies’ bottom line.

The voices loudly criticizing California for its rigid control of insurance pricing are ignoring numerous similar examples from the rest of the country. In 2023, after the federal flood insurance program began to adjust its premiums to better reflect climate realities, 10 states across the political spectrum — including reliably red Louisiana, Florida and Texas and moderate blue Virginia — sued the program. And California isn’t the only state that failed to raise premiums to properly fund its FAIR plan, the state-sponsored insurer of last resort often relied on by those living in climate-vulnerable areas; Florida did as well.

Home insurance is just one way our financial system encourages Americans to move to flood-prone sections of Florida or parched, air-conditioning-dependent Arizona. The government mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which guarantee about 70 percent of mortgages on single-family homes, charge the same fees regardless of climate risk. Nobody intends to move into harm’s way. Many people settle in places like Texas because housing is generally more affordable. But that affordability is a mirage: Their mortgage and insurance risks are being subsidized by everyone else. This system, and the continual building in risky areas, portends ever-rising disaster losses.

We get why change is hard. Losing one’s home can be economically and emotionally devastating. Rising insurance premiums can stress homeowners who are already struggling. For households that have their entire life savings tied to their homes, hefty premiums combined with lower home values tied to the cost of insurance could even lead them to default on their mortgages.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,0,-0.98,[],"['Of', 'Virginia', 'Texas', 'Enid', 'Florida']"

“Homeowners’ insurance is where many Americans are now feeling the financial effect of climate change directly, in their pocketbook,” said Ethan Zindler, climate counselor at the Treasury Department. “Nature doesn’t really care whether people are living in a blue state or a red state or another state, or whether you do or don’t believe in climate change.”

The rising cancellation rates are part of a broader trend captured by the Treasury Department, which analyzed information for 246 million insurance policies issued by 330 insurers nationwide from 2018 through 2022. The result is the most comprehensive look yet at the effect of climate change on the American home insurance market.

Homeowners with mortgages are generally required by lenders to carry insurance. But people who own a house outright, perhaps because the property has been in a family for decades or generations, have the option of dropping insurance.

The cost and frequency of insurance claims are rising quickly in the highest-risk parts of the United States, as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to the numbers. They show that the financial stress on insurers is also growing.

So, too, is the cost of insurance, which has risen far more in high-risk areas than elsewhere.

As those trends worsen, more people are getting thrown off their insurance plans. That happens two ways. One is through cancellations, when insurers drop homeowners who fail to pay their premiums. Another is through nonrenewals, in which insurers refuse to renew the policies of homeowners who want to keep paying for coverage.

The rates of both cancellations and nonrenewals are increasing, and those increases are most pronounced in high-risk areas.

Total nonrenewals + cancellations nonrenewals nonpayment cancellations 2.5% 2.5% Very high 6.0% 2.0% 5.0% 2.0% 1.5% High Moderate Low 1.0% 4.0% Very low 1.5% 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Higher Risk, Fewer Insured Homeowners policies in the riskiest areas have been increasingly dropped by insurance companies or cancelled for missed payments.

In more than 150 ZIP codes around the country, insurers canceled at least 10 percent of home insurance policies in 2022, the most recent year for which numbers are available, because homeowners failed to pay their premiums, according to the data. Cancellation rates were highest in coastal areas in the Carolinas, including Hilton Head, Charleston and Myrtle Beach, which are especially exposed to hurricanes. They were also high in parts of West Virginia, Arizona and California.

The data doesn’t capture why homeowners chose to stop paying. But Nellie Liang, the Treasury Department’s under secretary for domestic finance, said her team viewed it as an indicator of families facing growing financial stress worsened by climate change.

“Households are not able to bear the burden by themselves,” Ms. Liang said.

As for cases where insurance companies refused to renew policies even for their paying customers, those nonrenewal rates were also higher, and grew faster, in high-risk areas. The ZIP codes with the greatest share of nonrenewals in 2022 were in coastal South Carolina as well as parts of California, including in Sonoma County and Yuba County, which have been hit by wildfires. Areas of Tennessee that have suffered severe storms also saw high nonrenewals.

The destabilization of the home insurance market doesn’t hurt only homeowners, Ms. Liang said. It also threatens property-tax revenues that communities rely on, since tax receipts can decline if homeowners can’t rebuild or if homes lose value. It also hurts local businesses that rely on homeowners as customers.

“There’s a lot to worry about,” Ms. Liang said.

The Treasury Department’s effort to gather data was complicated by the political clashes over climate change, and also over who gets to regulate insurance companies.

The department announced the effort in 2021 as part of the Biden administration’s efforts to address the financial effects of climate change. Its original plan was to gather data directly from insurance companies. But some state insurance commissioners (which regulate the industry) objected, backed by Republicans in Congress.

So the Treasury Department let state commissioners gather the data. Or not gather it: Seven states — Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, Indiana, Montana and North Dakota — declined to participate. According to the Treasury Department, this meant that local insurance companies that happen to be headquartered in those states did not provide data. But national insurers still provided data for homeowners they cover in those states. (Another exception was Texas, where they did not provide some data.)

In addition, the states that did participate chose to withhold some important information, including data from their state-mandated high-risk-insurance plans. Those plans, which are designed to provide insurance to people who can’t buy it from regular insurance companies, are becoming more important as climate change worsens. Excluding those plans means the data doesn’t capture the experience of many homeowners facing the highest risk from climate threats.

And of the data that was collected, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents state commissioners and compiled data from them, shared only a portion with the Treasury Department.

The association did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Treasury Department, as part of its report, called on state commissioners and the national association to keep working with the agency’s Federal Insurance Office to gather and publish the data annually, and even expand that effort by including information for high-risk pools.

The chances of that happening are unclear. Last month, Republican state insurance commissioners wrote to Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the leaders of what President-elect Donald J. Trump has called his new Department of Government Efficiency, urging them to scrap the Federal Insurance Office altogether.

They argued that the office’s work gathering data on climate change showed that the federal government was trying to exceed its authority and that, by moving ahead with releasing the new data, the office “has chosen to proceed with flawed information, which risks misleading the public.” The commissioners did not say why they viewed the information as flawed.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.9989,"['United States', 'Georgia']","['Montana', 'Myrtle Beach', 'Texas', 'Charleston', 'Iowa', 'Florida']"

Liberal outlets criticized President-elect Donald J. Trump’s reaction to the fires, which they described as insensitive. Some attributed the intensity of the fires to climate change.

22,2024-12-18,Insurers Are Deserting Homeowners as Climate Shocks Worsen,"Insurers Are Deserting Homeowners as Climate Shocks Worsen Without insurance, it’s impossible to get a mortgage; without a mortgage, most Americans can’t buy a home. The home of Richard D. Zimmel on the outskirts of Silver City, N.M.

The insurance crisis spreading across the United States arrived at Richard D. Zimmel’s door last week in the form of a letter.

Mr. Zimmel, who lives in the increasingly fire-prone hills outside Silver City, N.M., had done everything right. He trimmed the trees away from his house, and covered his yard in gravel to stop flames rushing in from the forest near his property. In case that buffer zone failed, he sheathed his house in fire-resistant stucco, and topped it with a noncombustible steel roof.

None of it mattered. His insurance company, Homesite Insurance, dumped him. “Property is located in a brushfire or wildfire area that no longer meets Homesite’s minimum standard for wildfire risk,” the letter read. (Homesite did not respond to a request for comment.)

Mr. Zimmel has company. Since 2018, more than 1.9 million home insurance contracts nationwide have been dropped — “nonrenewed,” in the parlance of the industry. In more than 200 counties, the nonrenewal rate has tripled or more, according to the findings of a congressional investigation released Wednesday.

As a warming planet delivers more wildfires, hurricanes and other threats, America’s once reliably boring home insurance market has become the place where climate shocks collide with everyday life.

The consequences could be profound. Without insurance, you can’t get a mortgage; without a mortgage, most Americans can’t buy a home. Communities that are deemed too dangerous to insure face the risk of falling property values, which means less tax revenue for schools, police and other basic services. As insurers pull back, they can destabilize the communities left behind, making their decisions a predictor of the disruption to come.

Now, for the first time, the scale of that pullback is becoming public. Last fall, the Senate Budget Committee demanded the country’s largest insurance companies provide the number of nonrenewals by county and year. The result is a map that tracks the climate crisis in a new way.

The American Property Casualty Insurance Association, a trade group, said information about nonrenewals was “unsuitable for providing meaningful information about climate change impacts,” because the data doesn’t show why individual insurers made decisions. The group added that efforts to gather data from insurers “could have an anticompetitive effect on the market.”

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island and the committee’s chairman, said the new information was crucial. In an interview, he called the new data as good an indicator as any “for predicting the likelihood and timing of a significant, systemic economic crash,” as disruption in the insurance market spreads to property values.

“The climate crisis that is coming our way is not just about polar bears, and it’s not just about green jobs,” Mr. Whitehouse said Wednesday during a hearing on the investigation’s findings. “It actually is coming through your mail slot, in the form of insurance cancellations, insurance nonrenewals and dramatic increases in insurance costs.”

The map of dropped policies shows how the crisis in the American home insurance market has spread beyond well-known problems in Florida and California. The jump in nonrenewals now extends along the Gulf Coast, through Alabama and Mississippi; up the Atlantic seaboard, through the Carolinas, Virginia and into southern New England; inland, to parts of the plains and Intermountain West; and even as far as Hawaii.

Silver City shows how the insurance crisis is a result of several factors over decades — and how hard it is to solve.

Founded as a mining town in the 1870s, the city of 10,000 nestles up against the foothills of the Gila National Forest, 3.3 million acres of alligator juniper, ponderosa pine and Gambel oak draped across softly sloping mountains.

That forest has also become a firetrap.

Since its designation as a national forest in 1924, the U.S. government sought to protect the land by stopping forest fires. That policy failed to take into account that fires clear out vegetation, according to Adam Mendonca, the U.S. Forest Service’s Washington deputy director of fire and aviation, who lives in Silver City. The result was the buildup of decades of additional trees and brush, which means wildfires, when they do happen, now burn larger and hotter.

That threat has been exacerbated by climate change, which has brought higher temperatures and drier conditions. Wildfires are now more likely to break out any time of year.

“We used to take our wildland gear home, put it into storage about September, and then bring it back to the station in February,” said Milo Lambert, Silver City’s fire chief. “Now it doesn’t leave the trucks.”

Milo Lambert, Silver City’s fire chief.

Even as the threat of wildfires has grown, home construction has pushed further into the forest. On a recent afternoon, Eric Casler, an assistant professor of natural sciences at Western New Mexico University, surveyed the neighborhoods that have grown up north of the city limits.

“See all these scattered houses out here?” Mr. Casler said. If a wildfire started to burn through the area, “it’s going to be really hard for them to stop it.”

It’s not just where people build homes that puts them at risk, experts said, but how those homes are constructed. Outside city limits, Grant County has no zoning or wildfire building restrictions, according to Roger Groves, the fire chief for the county, which includes Silver City.

Taken together, those challenges have caused insurers to pull back, according to Susan Sumrall, an insurance agent in Silver City.

Across Grant County, 51 home insurance contracts were not renewed in 2018, based on the data provided to the committee. That’s about one in 100 policies. By last year, that number had doubled to 100 nonrenewals, even as the county’s total population shrank.

One of Ms. Sumrall’s clients who has lost her insurance is Charlene Rosati. Ms. Rosati and her husband had to spend months in Houston, where he was being treated for cancer. Her insurance company, State Farm, sent an inspector to check if the home was being properly maintained, Ms. Rosati said, and concluded it was not.

Ms. Rosati’s husband died in September last year. Soon after, State Farm told her it wouldn’t renew her coverage. The company did not respond to a request for comment.

Many homes in and around Silver City are mobile or manufactured homes, which can offer less protection against fires than traditional site-built houses. Lorri Williams lives in a manufactured home in a valley just outside of Silver City. She, too, got a letter from her insurer, Standard Casualty Company, based in Texas.

“Reason — unsatisfactory risk,” the company wrote in block letters. “Your home is either located inside of or in close proximity of an area that is identified as having a high risk of wildfire.”

Standard Casualty Company did not respond to a request for comment.

People who lose insurance often don’t have great options. Ms. Williams’s broker, Chelsea Hotchkiss, tried getting her another insurer, with no luck. Ms. Hotchkiss suggested the state-run high-risk insurance program, which offers coverage to homeowners who can’t find it on the private market. But that program is more expensive and provides less coverage.

After Mr. Zimmel got his nonrenewal letter last week, he called State Farm, which declined to cover him. His insurance agent struck out with three more carriers, including Travelers. (State Farm and Travelers did not respond to requests for comment.) Finally, a smaller company agreed to insure his house, but his premiums jumped by one-third.

Mr. Zimmel’s bigger worry, he said, is how the struggle over insurance could affect his home’s value, which his real estate agent estimates at about $725,000.

“I just don’t know what’s going to happen to the town if this keeps happening,” said Mr. Zimmel’s agent, Shelley Scarborough.

Officials are trying to reduce wildfire risk. The county is looking at setting building standards to cut fire exposure, Mr. Groves said. State officials are also considering ways to get more homeowners to clear the vegetation from their property, possibly through a pilot project in nearby Lincoln County that would make those steps necessary to qualify for the state high-risk insurance pool.

And the U.S. Forest Service is trying to clear out decades’ worth of thick brush and other excess vegetation — what experts call “treating” the forest. That process is anything but simple.

In the parts of the forest nearest the city, workers have cut down smaller trees, low-hanging branches and scrub oak, then stacked them into piles to dry out. After a year or so, the piles are set on fire — ideally during the winter, to reduce the risk of the fire spreading.

After those two steps, the Forest Service can perform a prescribed burn: deliberately setting fire to a patch of the forest to further clear out the vegetation. To maintain that work, the process should typically be repeated every five to 10 years.

The Forest Service has been treating between 25,000 and 30,000 of the 3.3 million acres in the Gila Forest each year, according to Mr. Mendonca. “It’s a constant struggle for the agency to try to address,” he said, citing a shortage of staffing, money and time.

U.S. Forest Service and Conservation Corps New Mexico members refilled their drip torches while conducting a prescribed fire in Mimbres.

The underlying challenges that are driving insurers from Silver City can be found across the country.

In parts of Wyoming, the growing risk of wildfire is similarly pushing insurers to drop customers. Teton County, which includes Jackson Hole, saw nonrenewal rates increase 1,394 percent since 2018. Jeff Rude, the state insurance commissioner, said the state was focused on educating homeowners about how to reduce the risk on their land, because tougher building standards are unpopular in Wyoming.

In California, which has some of the country’s most stringent building codes to address wildfire risk, insurers have nonetheless been fleeing. In some counties, nonrenewal rates have increased more than 500 percent since 2018. Officials announced last week that they would make it easier for insurers to raise rates, but in exchange, those insurers must agree to keep doing business in fire-prone areas.

In Hawaii, the nonrenewal rate tripled between 2018 and 2023, one of the highest increases in the country. The growing risk from wildfires and other threats has led to what Gov. Josh Green, a Democrat, has called a “condo insurance crisis.” In August, he signed an emergency proclamation, setting up a task force to search for solutions.

In coastal South Carolina, which now has some of the highest nonrenewal rates in the country, insurers have been going out of business, reducing their exposure or just leaving the area, said Jay Taylor, an insurance agent in Beaufort County, which includes Hilton Head, an area particularly exposed to sea-level rise, hurricanes and other climate threats.

Homeowners complain about the difficulty and cost of getting insurance, he said. But the desire to live by the ocean, despite the danger, remains the stronger force.

“They may cuss us out,” Mr. Taylor said. “But they never stop building.”

Hundreds or even thousands are feared dead as a result of Tropical Cyclone Chido, which barreled into Mayotte, a series of islands off the eastern coast of Africa, over the weekend.

We’ve compiled a list of some of the essentials. To make our list, we looked at the emergency kit lists published by FEMA, the American Red Cross and local agencies. We also checked out specific product recommendations cheered by Reddit users or published by Wirecutter, a product review website owned by The New York Times Company, which publishes emergency preparedness guides broken down by the type of disaster, whether a hurricane, fire or earthquake. After culling through all of those resources, we narrowed down our go-bag contents to the most essential items that are also affordable (most of our suggestions cost less than $25).

Our basic emergency kit includes durable products that can sit in the corner of a closet, or in the trunk of a car, for years. (Although experts recommend reviewing emergency go bags at least once a year to make sure everything is charged, working and not expired.)

What to Pack in your Extreme-Weather Go Bag

Cash

Cash is king during an emergency. Without power, many businesses can’t run credit cards. And if phone networks aren’t working, you won’t be able to use Venmo or Apple Wallet either. So pack enough cash for at least three days, and overestimate when in doubt: Experts recommend anything from $500 to $1,500 per person. Be sure to have smaller bills — it isn’t easy to break a hundred during a hurricane.

Copies of important documents

“Copies of records are one of the more commonly missed items in a kit, in addition to cash,” Ms. Fox, of the American Red Cross, said. Think: passports, birth certificates, Social Security cards, photos, insurance documents, bank information, a local map and anything else that could cause a huge problem to not have when you need it. Michael Wallace, program director of emergency and security studies at Tulane University in New Orleans, recommends storing them all in this $16 waterproof and fireproof pouch.

Water

During an emergency, you can never have too much water. FEMA recommends one gallon of water per person, per day. Put aside one case of bottled water (40 regular-size bottles is about five gallons) or one five-gallon bottle for each family member. Some experts suggest more — a 14-day supply — for hygiene purposes. (Note that many experts prefer canned water to plastic bottles, because of its longer shelf life.) Or, try a water container that you can fill yourself, like this $18 collapsible bag that holds five gallons or this $20 hard-sided container that holds seven gallons. The $19 LifeStraw Personal Water Filter, a handy way to remove bacteria from river water, for example, can also provide the peace of mind of clean water no matter what.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.1148,[],['New Orleans']
26,2024-12-07,Mortgage Regulators Are Shrugging Off Climate Risk. It Could Cost Taxpayers Billions.,"One report has estimated that homes in places at risk of flooding were collectively overpriced by at least $187 billion; in some counties in Appalachia and coastal Louisiana, that amounts to more than 10 percent of the total property value. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office found that federally backed mortgages covered properties that were likely to sustain about $190 billion in flood damage over 30 years. That’s not counting the peril of wildfires or drought.

While banks are becoming more careful about extending credit in areas that might flood, and homeowners are responding to flood risk disclosures on property search websites, the government-sponsored enterprises do not formally take such risks into account when underwriting loans. Studies have found that banks are more likely to sell mortgages in risky areas to the secondary market, and to Fannie and Freddie specifically after hurricanes (a conclusion that economists funded by Fannie Mae have disputed).

Fannie and Freddie have generally relied on insurance to deal with climate risk management: Flood coverage is required in special flood hazard areas.

That has become a riskier gambit in recent years, however, as disasters have also hit places far beyond where federal flood maps say they’re supposed to. At the same time, extreme weather has driven up insurance costs nationwide. Recent research has found that those rising costs can drive homeowners into delinquency, even if the house avoids damage.

Unexpectedly large losses could undermine Fannie’s and Freddie’s profits and threaten their ability to keep the mortgage market liquid, said Susan Crawford, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who wrote a book last year about the impact of sea-level rise in Charleston, S.C.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.9368,[],['Charleston']
27,2024-12-05,What to Do When There’s a Tsunami Warning,"A tsunami is in the news. Here are answers to some common questions about the phenomenon.

What causes a tsunami?

Most tsunamis are caused by earthquakes. When a tectonic plate shifts abruptly, it can displace a “tremendous amount of water,” causing waves to sweep out in all directions “like a ripple in a pond,” said Dave Snider, a tsunami warning coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Not every earthquake in a coastal area will bring about a tsunami, but these waves can have devastating impacts when they strike nearby shores. In rare cases, tsunamis can travel hundreds of miles across oceans at the speed of a jet, causing destruction far away from their points of origin. Tsunamis can occasionally occur in bodies of water other than the ocean, such as a lake.

A tsunami can be imperceptible to someone aboard a boat in the deep ocean. However, tsunami waves grow taller in shallower waters, making them more dangerous as they approach the shore.

Less frequently, tsunamis can be caused by landslides, volcanic activity or other phenomena that displace enough water to create a disturbance. In rare cases, a type of tsunami known as a meteotsunami can be generated by a change in air pressure associated with a weather system. Several people died when a meteotsunami struck Lake Michigan in 1954.",,5,Earthquake_Tsunami_MajorEvents,natural disaster,0,0,0,-0.9846,[],[]
28,2024-12-01,Republicans Would Regret Letting Elon Musk Ax Weather Forecasting,"The best-known part of NOAA, touching all of our daily lives, is the National Weather Service. This is where daily forecasts and timely warning of severe storms, hurricanes and blizzards come from. Using satellites, balloon launches, ships, aircraft and weather stations, NOAA and its offices around the country provide vital services like clockwork, free of charge — services that cannot be adequately replaced by the private sector in part because they wouldn’t necessarily be profitable.

For most of its history, NOAA has largely avoided politicization especially because weather forecasting has been seen as nonpartisan. Members of Congress from both parties are highly engaged in its work. Unfortunately, legislation introduced by Representative Frank Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma — a state with a lot of tornadoes — that would have helped NOAA to update its weather research and forecasting programs passed the House but languished in the Senate and is unlikely to move forward in this session of Congress. However, in 2025 there is another opportunity to improve the agency and its services to taxpayers and businesses.

While there are already multiple efforts at NOAA to improve weather modeling, observation collection and marine management, Congress has piled more responsibilities on the agency, and the funding has not kept up. NOAA is spread thin, with a backlog of maintenance and upgrades that will probably take years to get through without significantly more sustained budget support.

As we enter a new world of artificial intelligence, NOAA needs significantly more computational resources to improve weather models rapidly. Otherwise, the United States risks becoming more dependent on similar institutions in Europe. Plain and simple, NOAA weather modeling and climate analysis efforts do not have the funding in the current institutional structure to keep up with our European friends. And because the military relies on NOAA’s infrastructure, the risks of and damage from extreme weather and climate events are a national security concern as much as an economic one. With a bigger budget, NOAA could offer increased value for taxpayers and boost the entire U.S. economy. What would that look like?

First, we need to have a serious conversation about further upgrading the agency’s aging systems like radars; observations, including balloons and buoys; research aircraft; satellites; and supercomputers. There is also an opportunity to build a state-of-the-art weather and climate prediction capability for the nation. That would involve modernizing emergency communication systems for future disasters instead of reacting to the most recent one. Though accurate weather forecasts, combined with effective watches and warnings, have reduced human deaths from extreme weather, still too many Americans are seemingly caught off guard by weather disasters.

30,2024-11-21,Landslides Are a Growing Climate Threat. What Do We Know About The Risks?,"One way to find coverage is through a separate line item called difference-in-conditions. Such insurance could cost up to $15,000 a year, according to a report by RAND Corporation, and the quotes are notoriously difficult to find, especially after a community has already faced a landslide.

Experts say the dearth in insurance is largely because the risk is so difficult to predict and the marketplace of people requesting the insurance is so small.

The lack of insurance access has led some communities at a higher risk for landslides to push back against hazard maps that could better protect them because they don’t want to lower the value of their homes or prevent development. People who’ve lost homes, cars or other property to landslides can suffer a total loss, and some can still be on the hook to pay back the mortgage for a house that no longer exists.

What is the federal government doing to address the problem?

In 2021, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican, along with Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, a Democrat, introduced the National Landslide Preparedness Act. It provided more funding for the United States Geological Survey to map the hazards, improve forecasting and set up landslide hazard offices in states across the country.

In November, as the Pacific Northwest faced its first atmospheric river of the season, Sen. Murkowski, along with California Senator Alex Padilla, introduced a bill to improve forecasting of atmospheric rivers that could help reduce flood risks and bolster emergency preparedness.

His “refusal to provide climate finance will deepen the crisis,” Mr. Singh added, “endangering lives and livelihoods — especially in regions least responsible for, yet most impacted by, climate change.”

The question of what rich countries owe to poor countries has been a sticking point in international climate talks for years. Wealthy areas like the United States and Europe have historically pumped more heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the air than others by burning coal, oil and gas, while poorer countries, such as those in Africa, are more vulnerable to climate disasters.

Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, wealthy nations agreed to provide significantly more financial aid to developing nations. The vast majority of that aid, however, goes toward helping countries reduce their greenhouse gases, such as by building solar or wind farms.

But as global emissions keep rising and as the planet gets hotter, the necessity of adapting to heat waves, floods, sea level rise and other effects of climate change is getting more attention. Adaptation aid from wealthy nations and development banks jumped to $28 billion in 2022 from $21 billion in 2021.

Climate adaptation can include planting drought-resistant crops, raising buildings to avoid flood damage or moving communities away from coastlines.

But being proactive about that is extremely difficult.”

In basic terms, eastern Spain was flooded this week because of a cutoff low: an area of low pressure that breaks away from the jet stream, the fast-moving current of wind that meanders west to east across the globe’s temperate regions.

When a cutoff low forms in the Gulf of Cádiz off southern Spain, it produces winds that blow warm, moist air from above the Mediterranean Sea toward the country’s eastern coast. This moisture-laden air hits the mountains and is pushed skyward, condensing into clouds that dump rain onto coastal areas including the province of Valencia.

Normally the jet stream would whisk such weather systems away relatively quickly. But because cutoff lows are detached from those winds, they can linger in place, blasting the same places with rain for days and days.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,-0.8765,['Spain'],['Valencia']

A team of researchers looked at NASA satellite data on 60,000 wildfires in the contiguous United States between 2001 and 2020. After classifying each blaze by the most it grew in a single day, the scientists found that these growth rates had increased over time in much of the West, and California in particular.

Their study, published Thursday in the journal Science, also found that the fastest-growing infernos were responsible for a huge share of the devastation. The speediest 2.7 percent of blazes accounted for almost 80 percent of structures destroyed, two-thirds of fatalities and more than 60 percent of the money spent on fire suppression, the researchers found.

38,2024-10-23,I Broke Down About Hurricane Milton on Live TV. What Happened Next Surprised Me.,"A recent survey of Americans ages 16 to 25 showed that 85 percent were worried about the climate crisis. The majority, 57 percent, were “very or extremely” worried. More broadly, 64 percent of Americans across all generations say they are at least “somewhat worried” about global warming. Whether you were born into this changed planet or, like me, have seen it degenerate before your very eyes, there’s plenty to fret about.

And yet, two out of every three Americans say they “rarely” or “never” discuss global warming with family and friends. That must change. My connection and level of comfort with the audience allowed me to show my emotions without fear of judgment. It might sound corny, but it was like I was speaking to family and friends. If I can do it over the airwaves, shouldn’t everyone be able to do it at the kitchen table?

If we can have more conversations about climate change and how it’s making us feel, we can share the burden and prioritize action.

Action on climate isn’t just what you can do on your own but also what you can do with others. If your neighborhood or school can switch to renewable energy, heat pumps and electric vehicles to lower their carbon footprint, it’s far more powerful than making those changes inside your household. One example is the 19-fold increase over the last five years in the size of the electric school bus fleet. Overall, the United States spent a record $248 billion in 2023 on the clean energy transition, more than triple what it was in 2018.

We must also look for more ways to scale community actions to the city, county, state and the nation. The way to demand that kind of large-scale action on climate is to identify and support elected leaders who can sway and enact climate-friendly policies.

39,2024-10-22,America’s Flooding Problem,"1. Fight the water

The first strategy is to fight the water: Build walls to keep it out of your city, along with giant pumps and drains to remove whatever water gets in. Think of Holland, much of which would be underwater without a massive network of barriers, or Venice, which now relies on sea walls during high tide.

But thanks to climate change, this approach means ever-more-epic fortifications. After Hurricane Katrina, the federal government built a $14 billion, 350-mile defensive ring around New Orleans. The United States is also looking at building 12 movable sea barriers to protect New York Harbor from a storm surge, at an initial cost of $52 billion.

Even the beneficiaries aren’t always thrilled. A plan to build a six-mile-long, 20-foot-high sea wall around the coast of Miami prompted outrage: It would, after all, ruin the view. The plan was abandoned.

2. Live with it

The second approach is to accept that water will get in, so we should live with it. This entails elevating homes off the ground, as builders do in the Outer Banks or coastal Louisiana. It also means raising roads, power stations and other critical infrastructure — all at no small cost.

Another example of living with water is described in an excellent new piece from my colleague Rory Smith, who visited a coastal plain in southwest England that used to be farmland protected by a sea wall. Officials converted it into a marsh when they realized it was best just to open up flood barriers, turning the area into a giant sponge.

41,2023-07-13,Compounding Disasters,"Extreme weather suddenly seems to be happening everywhere at once.

The heat index in parts of Arizona, Texas and Florida will surpass 110 degrees Fahrenheit today. Much of the Midwest is in a severe drought. Areas in New York and Vermont just saw as much rain in a day as is typical for all of July, and subsequent flash floods washed out homes, cars and bridges. Wildfire smoke recently blanketed the Midwest and Northeast — at times giving U.S. cities the worst air quality in the world.

These events show one danger of global warming: Simultaneous climate disasters can play off one another, further worsening extreme weather and straining limited resources. Consider some examples:

For years, the U.S. and Australia shared firefighting resources because their fire seasons do not typically overlap. In 2019 and 2020, they were instead forced to compete for personnel and equipment as California dealt with a wildfire season that extended into its winter, while much of Australia burned during its so-called Black Summer.

In the Western U.S., both more heat and unusually dry conditions have caused the megadrought of recent years. The heat and dryness have also acted as kindling for more frequent and more severe fires. In both cases, the two conditions, exacerbated by climate change, compounded each other to cause more disasters.

Last year, a heat wave in Pakistan pushed temperatures above 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Then floods submerged more than a third of the nation. The back-to-back events strained resources in an already poor country.

States often support each other during natural disasters by sending equipment or opening residents’ homes to people who have been displaced. But New York can’t as easily help neighboring Vermont while both states are battling floods. (Vermont has received help from North Carolina, Michigan and Connecticut, among others.)

We should expect more such problems going forward, largely propelled by climate change.

42,2021-02-20,The Lessons of the Texas Power Disaster,"Both sides have elided an interesting piece of Texas history. The person who put wind power on the Texas map was a Republican named George W. Bush. As governor, in 1999, Mr. Bush signed a law deregulating the state’s power market, at which point Texas started building loads of wind turbines. Wind now supplies about a quarter of the state’s energy diet — natural gas is about twice that — and Texas is far and away the biggest supplier of wind energy in the country and among the biggest in the world.

But wind, which supplies a smaller fraction of power in wintertime, had little to do with this week’s disaster. The simple truth is that the state was not prepared for the Arctic blast. A few wind turbines froze up, but the main culprits were uninsulated power plants run by natural gas. In northern states, such plants are built indoors; in Texas, as in other Southern states, the boilers and turbines are left exposed to the elements.

There are two lessons here to be absorbed and acted on. First, the country’s energy systems must be robust enough to withstand whatever surprises climate change is likely to bring. There is little doubt that a warming climate turned California’s forests into tinderboxes, leading to last summer’s frightening wildfires. The scientific connection between climate change and extreme cold is not as well established, but it would be foolish to assume that it is not there. (The dominant hypothesis is that global warming has weakened the air currents that keep the polar vortex and its freezing winds in check.) As the Princeton energy expert Jesse Jenkins observes in a recent Times Op-Ed, we know that climate change increases the frequency of extreme heat waves, droughts, wildfires, heavy rains and coastal flooding. We also know the damage these events can cause. To this list we should now add deep freezes.

If building resilience is one imperative, another is making sure that America’s power systems, the grid in particular, are reconfigured to do the ambitious job Mr. Biden has in mind for them — to not just survive the effects of climate change but to lead the fight against it. Mr. Biden’s lofty goal is to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury and to eliminate fossil fuel emissions from the power sector by 2035. In the simplest terms, this will mean electrifying everything in sight: a huge increase in battery-powered cars and in charging stations to serve them; a big jump in the number of homes and buildings heated by electric heat pumps instead of oil and gas; and, crucially, a grid that delivers all this electricity from clean energy sources like wind and solar.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,1,0.9164,[],"['George', 'Princeton', 'Texas']"

48,2024-09-07,The Killer Climate Disaster That Has No Name,"Naming an extreme weather system also helps us recognize it as an enemy and mobilize support for public projects to combat future storms. After Sandy, for instance, citizens and officials concerned about climate change used stories from the storm to help persuade lawmakers to invest billions in new infrastructure, including renewable energy projects and flood management systems that double as social infrastructure. Heat waves rarely inspire that kind of policy action, because we can barely distinguish one from another, even when we’ve lived through them.

Naming hurricanes but not heat waves leaves no doubt about which threat our government, culture and society take more seriously. Compared with hurricanes, heat waves already face an uphill battle for attention, in part because the people they affect most are not property owners in expensive coastal areas, but America’s most disadvantaged: the old, the isolated, the poor and racially segregated residents of impoverished urban neighborhoods.

Heat is a silent and invisible killer. It usually fails to generate the kind of spectacular imagery that lands weather on prime-time television or a newspaper’s front page. We’ve all seen round-the-clock coverage of an approaching hurricane, animated by color-coded satellite maps, live reports from a gusty coast and stern warnings about imminent danger. Heat waves don’t receive anywhere near that level of attention. Instead of conveying drama and danger, most heat stories read like dry public service announcements.

What’s more, heat doesn’t produce enough property damage to induce federal emergency declarations from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose policies have historically leaned more toward protecting property and sustaining the economy than saving lives. Environmental, labor and health care groups have petitioned FEMA to start classifying extreme heat as a major disaster, but so far to no avail. As a result, state and local governments aren’t entitled to relief funds that could help them prepare for and cope with heat waves by, for example, shoring up their social infrastructure, so that residents can access libraries, swimming pools and senior centers during power outages, or improving the resilience of the electrical grid.

When a hurricane is coming, governors are expected to remain in their state to lead the response. But during the great Chicago heat wave of 1995, for instance, when an estimated 739 people died in just one blistering week, Chicago’s mayor and health commissioner went on vacation to escape the stifling conditions. The same thing happened across Europe in 2003, when officials from several nations were on vacation during a terribly lethal heat wave. Had those heat waves had a name, and been publicly recognized as a crisis, leaders might’ve been pressured to remain on hand to manage the response — and perhaps even save lives.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.9926,['United States'],['Chicago']
49,2022-09-07,A Summer of Climate Disasters,"Climate disasters also hit many other parts of the world this year:

In the U.S., a heat wave on the West Coast has sent temperatures soaring above 110 degrees Fahrenheit in the past few days. About 100 million Americans across the country suffered another heat wave earlier this summer. And floods have ravaged parts of the U.S., including Kentucky and Missouri.

The earlier heat wave that hit Pakistan reached India, too. A severe drought also struck parts of India this summer, reducing the country’s food exports. And floods in Bengaluru, India’s tech capital, forced workers to ride boats and tractors to get to the office.

A heat wave and drought in China dried up rivers, disabling hydroelectric dams and cutting off ships carrying supplies.

Another heat wave in Europe sent temperatures in Britain to a record 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Droughts across the continent dried up rivers, exposing sunken ships from World War II and disrupting the river cruise industry. And wildfires in Europe have burned nearly three times as much land so far this year as the 2006-2021 average.

In April, heavy rainfall caused floods and mudslides in South Africa that killed at least 45 people.

“Some of these events have no historical comparisons from 200 years ago,” my colleague Raymond Zhong, who covers climate change, told me.

Why? Rising temperatures create the circumstances for more frequent and more intense heat waves. Prolonged heat causes more frequent and more intense droughts and wildfires. And as it gets warmer, more water evaporates from the oceans — leading to more moisture in the air, and then heavier rainfall, floods and mudslides.

More to come

In my conversations with experts, I referred to the summer’s extreme weather as a “new normal.” But the experts pushed back on that characterization. They argued that calling it normal suggested we had reached some sort of plateau.

“It’s very much getting worse,” said Kim Cobb, the director of the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. Humanity has emitted greenhouse gases through industrialization for more than a century. Those gases are already in the atmosphere, causing warming and extreme weather. Past and future emissions will continue to heat up the planet over the next couple of decades, leading to even more disasters.

That doesn’t mean the world is helpless, experts said. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as Democrats’ new spending law aims to do, can still lower the risk of climate disasters over the medium term. In the short term, humans can mitigate disasters through adaptation — using better forest management to reduce wildfire risk, for example, or building infrastructure that is more resilient to heavy rainfall and flooding.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,1,0,0,-0.9891,"['Pakistan', 'United States', 'India', 'China', 'South Africa']",['Missouri']

Last month, a magnitude 5.6 earthquake hit West Java, a province in Indonesia, leveling thousands of homes and buildings. The destruction left hundreds dead, and many are still missing throughout the region. Since the first day of the disaster, New York Times contributors in the area have been covering the rescue efforts and the aftermath.

Dera Menra Sijabat, who reports on Indonesia for The Times’s Seoul hub, worked in tandem with the photographer Ulet Ifansasti to show the world the realities of the devastation. In a recent interview, Mr. Sijabat and Mr. Ifansasti, who both live in Indonesia, spoke about staying safe as they navigated the rubble and aftershocks, tracking down accurate information and working together to make their coverage powerful. This interview has been edited and condensed.

How do you approach people after an earthquake?

DERA MENRA SIJABAT: When you attended a funeral, for example, you were in it, feeling the sadness. But then, I went there to work. I had to do my job, I have to ask questions, I had to make the report.

52,2021-05-14,We’re Not Ready for the Next Big Climate Disasters,"Studies going back decades have shown, for example, that farmers and city managers who prepare for a changing climate can absorb the shocks, at least to a point. By contrast, policies such as disaster assistance and subsidized flood insurance can have the opposite effect: They invite people to invest in harm’s way and make us less prepared when disaster strikes, as will become more common in a warming world.

We have combed through data from experts and the government and have tabulated what the federal government spends on climate-related disasters, including on infrastructure and insurance. We measured the balance of spending between “building back the same,” the usual response to disasters, and investing in making our infrastructure more resilient.

Our study found that the federal government is spending about $46 billion per year on recovery from disasters, which is seven times the level of investment in resilience. (Depending on the accounting method, that ratio could be as high as 40 to 1.) That nobody really knows these numbers shows why the nation must take stock of its infrastructure and disaster spending with an eye to resilience. At the same time, the National Climate Assessment, mandated by Congress and prepared by climate scientists every four years to evaluate the nation’s climate vulnerabilities, needs to look beyond what the scary science says to assess how government policies and private investment are amplifying or dampening the potential consequences of global warming.

Resilience matters because it is impossible to wall off the country from the effects of climate change. Tens of trillions of dollars are invested in infrastructure and personal property, with a lot more investment to come. Federal money accounts for only one-quarter of the nation’s investment in public infrastructure, but how that money is spent has a big influence on how the rest of the country invests and behaves.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.9282,['United States'],['Federal']

57,2024-04-30,Cows Are Just an Environmental Disaster,"ezra klein

From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.” [MUSIC PLAYING] I think one of the questions on which our whole future hinges is whether the lives that we have, the lives that we want, can exist within our environmental limits. Is there a way to live lives as energetically rich, as materially prosperous as Americans do now, without doing irreparable damage to the world? Is there a way for people all over to live lives even better than Americans do without doing irreparable damage to the world? Can we decouple material prosperity from the environment? If we can’t, then what we’re left with is a politics of sacrifice. Then we’re asking residents of rich countries to give up what they have. We’re asking residents of poor and middle income countries to give up what they want. There is no way around that. I’ve read the degrowth books. That is, in any honest rendering, what they are asking. And the politics of sacrifice, they’re abysmal. They’re really hard, particularly the speed at which we need to act on climate. You try passing a global carbon tax and enforcing it. You try doing energetic redistribution between rich and poor countries. You try banning, god forbid, hamburgers. But if you can marry prosperity to sustainability, if we can power the lives we want with clean energy, if we can feed the world without wrecking every ecosystem in our sight, then we have the politics of transition. And the politics of transition is hard. Deployment is hard. Change is hard. But it is more imaginable. And maybe you can even promise that things get better too, that we get cleaner air, healthier food, regenerated forests. That’s a bet a lot of the climate movement is now making. It’s a bet most countries are now making. But is it possible or is it just a fantasy? Do we actually have the critical minerals, the land, the technology? That’s a question that Hannah Ritchie, the lead researcher at Our World in Date, set out to answer in a book “Not the End of the World.” It’s a question that obsesses me, so I asked her to come on the show to talk about it. As always, my email for guest suggestions, for feedback, for reflections — ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hannah Ritchie, welcome to the show.

hannah ritchie

Thanks very much for having me.

ezra klein

I’ve heard you say something that has stuck in my mind, which is that air pollution is a problem of energy poverty. What do you mean by that?

hannah ritchie

So air pollution is generated when we burn stuff. And I think when people think of burning stuff they automatically think of burning fossil fuels, which is absolutely correct. But we also generate air pollution when we burn wood, or charcoal, or crop waste, or dung, which many people in the world, especially the poorest people in the world, rely on as their main energy source. So I think if you see images of Lahore or New Delhi in the U.S. we think, oh, my god, the levels of pollution there. But go back less than a century and that’s what — I mean, I’m in Edinburgh in Scotland. That’s what Edinburgh looked like. That’s what London looked like. That’s probably what New York looked like. It’s just that we are now further along the curve of pollution than many of these cities. What we tend to find is that air pollution follows what we call the Environmental Kuznets Curve. So if you imagine a graph, and on the y-axis, you have air pollution, and on the x-axis you have G.D.P. or income or wealth. What you tend to see is this upside down U-shape. So at very, very low incomes outdoor air pollution, for example, can be relatively low. What happens is that people get access to energy. They get access to industrial production. They get access to cars. And pollution starts to increase. Now, on that part of the curve, people accept that there’s a trade-off. Their need for energy trumps their need for clean air. And therefore, they put up with the dirty air because they just need it for energy.

ezra klein

Or, it should be said, they don’t always have a choice.

hannah ritchie

Or they don’t have a choice, yes. If they don’t have alternatives and fossil fuels is the only option they have, millions of people die simply because they do not even have access to fossil fuels. They’re stuck on wood or charcoal.

ezra klein

What’s the death toll of air pollution annually?

hannah ritchie

So there are a range of estimates. All of the estimates are in the millions. I mean, the W.H.O., the World Health Organization, has a figure of around 7 million every year, and around 57 million people die every year. It was slightly higher during Covid. If you take 57 million and you say 7 million are dying from air pollution, you’re talking about more than 10 percent of deaths can be attributed in some way to air pollution.

ezra klein

I want to zoom in on something happening on the part where the curve begins to slope down as the country gets richer. Because one way of thinking about air pollution, but a lot of environmental problems, is it to get less of the bad thing you need less of the good thing. To get less air pollution you need less industry. To get less air pollution you need fewer cars. But to use the example of the United States, we have many more cars today than we had in 1970 or 1975. But the air in 1975 was much worse than it is today. You go to California, you go to Los Angeles, where I grew up — I mean, the smog that would settle over L.A. was legendary. So how is that part happening? How are you getting less air pollution even as you are having an energetically richer life, even as you’re having a rise in the quantity of industrial production?

hannah ritchie

Yeah. So you’ve got two options. You can do less stuff, as you say, or you can improve the technologies so you can get the same stuff just with less pollution or less externalities. And there are a couple of key innovations here. I think that your example of cars is absolutely correct. There just have been massive developments in the reduction in pollution from cars. And that’s a combination of, one, policy controls, so forcing manufacturers to develop cars that emit less. But it’s also about then the technological innovation that comes from that kind of forced policy setting. And industrial sites, for example, a big issue across Europe and North America which has basically gone was acid rain. And there the problem was sulfur dioxide. So when we burn coal, you produce sulfur dioxide. And that was leaking out into the environment and causing acid rain. Emissions of sulfur dioxide have plummeted. And there again, there were two ways to do that. One, you could just stop burning coal. And, to some extent, that transition has happened. But another big innovation there is that we just developed a technology called a scrubber, or desulfurization technology that you could literally just put in the smokestack of the coal plant and take the sulfur out. That needed some push from government policy to force that innovation. And then it needed some investment to get there. But that was the flip side of the coin of you don’t need to just necessarily do less. You can develop technologies that can do better.

ezra klein

Sometimes there’s an argument — and certainly there is a suspicion — that what is happening is the rich countries are pushing their environmental problems out into the poor countries. Right? We used to make the dirty stuff here, burn the coal here. Now we do it in China, and we just by the end product from China. We’re going to talk about that in the carbon case a bit later on. But is that the case for air pollution?

hannah ritchie

No, I don’t think that’s really the case with air pollution. Yes, the U.K. and the U.S. have reduced levels of air pollution, but so has China. So it cannot possibly be the case that we’re just offshoring all of the pollution to China if China’s pollution is also falling rapidly. And it has fallen rapidly. Especially over the last decade, local air pollution in cities like Beijing and other major cities across China have really plummeted with massive health benefits for those populations.

ezra klein

To just add some numbers to that — because I think they’re really striking — in Beijing air pollution fell by 55 percent between 2013 and 2020. The number you have in the book for China as a whole is 40 percent. So how did they do that? What is happening that China could make air pollution fall so much faster than other countries have been able to do it in the past?

hannah ritchie

So this was really kick started by the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Pre-2008, if you were to ask someone, picture a city with really high levels of air pollution, they’d probably picture Beijing. And the world was descending on Beijing for the Olympics. The top athletes in the world were coming to the city, and all eyes were on Beijing. The Chinese government realized we can’t have this horrendously polluted city. We need to clean this up for the athletes that are coming in. And it was still one of the most polluted Olympics ever, but emissions and levels of air pollution were much lower than they were pre-Olympics. The problem is that when all the athletes went home and all of the eyes turned away, the pollution levels came back. It was a very short-term reduction in order to facilitate the Olympics. A couple of years on, and it was actually really a public backlash that said, why would the government do this for people coming in to watch the Olympics but not do it for us? And we have to live here day after day, year after year, with terrible impacts on health. And it was really this public pressure that kickstarted action on concerted reductions in levels of air pollution. A key one has been really strict reduction in coal burning in households, for example, which you would imagine in Edinburgh or London a century ago, as well. It’s the same in China, where people were using coal in cities to heat their homes. And there was a really strict crackdown on that, in some sense too strict, such that some households were temporarily left without energy. A shifting of industry outside of the city — the problem is that often you’ll have industrial sites very, very close to dense population centers. So you can move those industrial sites further out where there are less people. And then strict industrial controls — and in China, strict regulation can be put in place very, very quickly. And actually, industries do take action very quickly.

ezra klein

How much is the rapidity of what China was able to do because we simply have more ways to generate energy in 2024 than we did in 1904 without burning things? We have nuclear energy. We have solar energy. We have wind energy. We have advanced battery technology. How much is that an enabler of the possibilities here?

hannah ritchie

I think for China, in the last decade it hasn’t been — that contribution hasn’t been massive. Now, to be clear, China is rolling out renewable energies very, very, very quickly. It’s rolling out electric cars extremely quickly. But it’s still burning more coal than it was a decade ago. But as I say, going forward — and I think, for many other countries, this opportunity to skip a lot of the burning stuff phase of energy and moving straight to energy technologies where you don’t burn stuff is a massive opportunity to avoid the really high emissions and high polluting pathway that most countries have now been through. I think people underestimate how unique this current position is that we’re in. You said a century ago, but literally since the invention of fire humans have been burning stuff to generate energy. It’s only very, very recently that we now have the technologies and the opportunity to generate large amounts of energy, large and cheap energy without burning stuff. And I think people underestimate the scale of that opportunity.

ezra klein

One reason I really like the air pollution chapter in your book is that it sort of operates, I think, as a metaphor, which is this thing we did with air pollution, this thing we keep doing with air pollution, where we were able to bring it sharply down — the air in London, as you say, might be cleaner now than it has been in centuries. Is that possible for other kinds of environmental harm? Because I do think there is this question that sits in people’s minds of whether the materially rich lives that we live in richer countries today is possible for the planet without completely cooking it. And one of the ways you look at this is by comparing your carbon footprint to that of your grandparents. And it’s a kind of surprising comparison. So can you walk me through that?

hannah ritchie

Yeah. So if you look at the carbon footprint of the average person in the U.K. over time, what you see is that over the last few decades, emissions in the U.K. have fallen really sharply. So since 1990, they’ve fallen by around 50 percent. The pushback on that is always, well, we’ve only achieved that because we’ve offshored emissions to other countries. And that’s not a genuine reduction. Now, it’s completely true that the U.K. has offshored some of its emissions. But even when you account for that, and you account for that based on what we call consumption-based emissions — so it tries to adjust for the goods and services that the U.K. is buying and importing, and allocates those emissions to the U.K. rather than China, for example — what you find is that emissions are still falling, and still falling pretty quickly. And what that means is that my carbon footprint today is less than my grandparents when they were my age. Despite the fact that if you looked at our lifestyles, I think you would think that mine is much more luxurious than theirs was. And I’m sure they would say the same. And this is really the result of just technological change and decarbonization. And if you look at pre-Paris Agreement — so Paris Agreement 2015 — the course that we were talking about the world heading towards then was 4 to 5 degrees. And that was just completely catastrophic. That’s not really the pathway that we think we’re on anymore. We’re kind of on track for between 2.5 to 3 degrees. Now, to be clear, that’s not an acceptable. We do not want to be on a path towards 2.5 degrees. But it is vastly different from a world of 4 degrees. We’ve chopped off a degree of that trajectory, at least a degree of that trajectory that we thought we were on.

ezra klein

The point you make that I found somewhat revelatory, even though it makes total sense now that I think about it, is that actually as you get into higher numbers, as we hit 1.5 degrees, if we hit 2 degrees, that every tenth of a point after that becomes more, not less consequential. Can you talk through that idea of the increasing marginal value of reducing climate change?

hannah ritchie

Yeah. So we know that the impacts of climate change — and by that I mean the impact that temperature has on stuff like precipitation patterns, for example — does not scale linearly with warming. So going from 1.5 degrees to 2 degrees is worse than going from 1 degree to 1.5 degree. So as we get into these higher and higher temperature ranges, we expect that the impacts will not be linear and they will scale much more quickly, which means that our emphasis to keep temperatures as low as possible increases the higher the temperatures go. We also risk hitting feedback loops, or to some extent tipping points, which can amplify warming. And the words tipping points are kind of thrown around quite freely. And often people don’t define them very clearly. Here, I’m not necessarily talking about really large planetary scale tipping points that somehow flip us from one system into another. I’m often talking about more localized tipping points that we know exist in the system but don’t know exactly where they are. So if you take an example, for example, of Arctic sea ice, it is quite likely that by 2050 we will have some summers where there is no Arctic sea ice. It will recover in the winter. But during the summer, we might have no Arctic sea ice. Ice reflects sunlight, and therefore you have less being reflected. Now, that’s not going to have a massive impact on the global climate system. But it could increase our warming by, I don’t know, the estimate’s about 0.15 degrees. Now, if you had several of these feedback loops or tipping points, again you might not go from 2 degrees to 5 degrees. But you could very easily increase the temperature by 0.2 degrees, 0.3 degrees, 0.4 degrees, which means that if you are at a temperature of 1.8 degrees, you’re then shifted into a world of 2.2 degrees. And I think the key point here is that we don’t know exactly where these tipping points are. But some of them are potentially in that 1.5 to 2 degree range. And you’d certainly massively increase the risk of hitting them, the higher you are and closer you are to 2 degrees. So that’s why going from 1.8 to 2 degrees is much more consequential than going from 1.3 to 1.5.

ezra klein

I was struck reading through your book how much the solutions or the ameliorating policies seem to stretch across problem areas. I mean, it seems to me basically you’re talking about really two things over and over and over again, which is don’t burn so much stuff, and try to reduce the human footprint over land. And if you could get those two things more or less right, we could be in a much better place. That’s a question of political will, and organization, and cooperation. And it is an extraordinarily hard question, as we’ve talked about and as everybody knows. But it is not an unsolvable problem. It is a set of choices we make or we do not make.

hannah ritchie

I think these are tractable problems. They’re not easy problems. They’re really, really difficult to tackle, but they’re tractable. And the solutions that we have to solve them are getting better year after year after year. For me, what’s key is that they’re linking up with other co-benefits and stuff that people care about in the shorter term. So if you’re talking about energy, for example, we’re in a vastly different position from where we were a decade ago. Because it’s not just about tackling climate change or tackling air pollution. It’s also about energy security. It’s about having lower energy bills. It’s about having more localized energy systems, which makes me more optimistic that they become viable and accelerate. When people think about the vast array of environmental problems that we face, they get really overwhelmed. And they get really overwhelmed because they assume there are 50 solutions to 10 different problems, and therefore we need to find a way of implementing 500 different solutions. And as you say, the reality is that when you bring it down to the basics we need to stop burning stuff for energy. And we need to find a way of feeding people on much less land. And I think we are getting closer and closer to the solutions we need, and the solutions are getting better and better for us to do that every year.

ezra klein

One of the most common questions I just hear at all is whether it is possible for all these different countries to be powered by clean energy sources — renewables, nuclear. And we know there’s a lot of solar power. Right? The sun is big and it keeps shining. We know there’s a fair amount of wind. But other things are limiting factors — the number of minerals we have to create solar panels with. You’ve got to mine all this lithium and mine all this cobalt to get your batteries. As a matter of material, as a matter of how much the Earth has to give us, can we do what we need to do? Can we live and have more people living the kinds of lifestyles we see in the U.K., in the U.S., built on a clean energy foundation?

hannah ritchie

So there are a large number of researchers and different research organizations that have studied this question. And the answer that comes out is nearly always, yes, we have enough stuff. This has been said by the International Energy Agency. This has been said by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, by the Payne Institute. There was a recent paper by Seaver Wang and Zeke Hausfather and colleagues, where they looked at the mineral requirements specifically on low carbon electricity globally. And the resounding answer was there are almost no minerals where total amount is a constraint. What people also underestimate is that the amount of stuff we have or think we can extract tends to go up over time. And that’s because we find new deposits. We find new ways of extracting stuff that we couldn’t extract before. And actually, just the drive for low carbon energy will just increase our efforts in order to do that. The other key change there goes in the other direction, where we’re becoming much more material efficient about building this stuff. The amount of materials you need to build a solar panel today is not what it was a decade ago. For many of these minerals you need far, far less. So our amount of supplies are going to go up, and our material requirements are probably going to go down. So if we were looking into the future, I’m just not concerned about total material requirements.

ezra klein

I get, constantly, emails from people after we do climate episodes suggesting, hey, look. From what I can tell, the amount of mining we are going to need to do here to do this renewable energy transition, this is not a clean transition. This is just hiding the dirtiness somewhere else. Are people right to be suspicious that the mining we’re going to need, the intensity of getting the Earth to give up what it needs to give up if we’re going to have all these solar panels and batteries and turbines, that that’s going to blunt a lot of the efficacy of turning over to these fuels?

hannah ritchie

I think what’s key to highlight here is that there are no perfect solutions to this. There are no perfect solutions to meeting our energy needs or the energy transition. And I think the tough reality is that if we’re looking for a perfect solution that needs no materials, that needs no land, that has zero impacts whatsoever, we’ll be waiting forever. And we’ll just stay on this course of fossil fuels. So what we’re looking for are solutions that are much, much, much better than fossil fuels. And the reality is that we have them. Estimates for the amount of material requirements for mining is something like tens of millions of tons per year at an upper limit. Compare that to how much fossil fuels we’re currently extracting. That’s $15 billion tons every single year. We’re talking about mining orders of magnitude lower amount of materials compared to fossil fuels. It’s vastly, vastly different. And these are very, very vastly different systems. With fossil fuels, you extract them, you burn them. You extract them, you burn them. You get nothing back in return. What’s going to happen with the energy transition is that we’re going to need this massive ramp up period where we’re building stuff. Right? So we are extracting a lot of materials out of the Earth. But you can reuse that stuff at the end of its life. And I think we will also see massive leaps in terms of recycling or refurbishing these materials back into the system later. So we will have this big ramp up period, but we’ll move to a much more circular and sustainable system, which is vastly different from a fossil fuel system where it’s just extract, extract, extract.

ezra klein

To hold on that point about recycling for a minute — if you have a car that burns gasoline, you burn every tank of gasoline until you’re done with the car. And there’s no gasoline left at the end of that. If you have an electric vehicle, when you want to trade up for a different model or your car has reached the end of its useful life, that battery still has lithium and other things in it that can be reused. Right now, people reuse the minerals in electric vehicle batteries. And so, at the very least, there’s a possibility — I’m always a little bit skeptical of recycling because there are plenty of things that people think they can recycle that they cannot. But the things that are precious, you often can. And things like car batteries seem to be one of those even now.

hannah ritchie

Yeah, exactly. And I think, again, this comes back to underestimating how rapidly I think some of these technologies could shift, where it might not even be the case that the materials in your current electric car battery go into another electric car battery at the end of their life. They might be able to power more than one battery. And that’s because the material requirements for a battery in 15 years might be much lower than they are today just because we’ve had so much innovation and advancement in these technologies.

ezra klein

Let’s talk a bit about some of the different sources of energy here and sources of what gets called clean energy. So you have renewables. And mainly, I think what people are thinking of there are solar and wind. And the difficulty of solar and wind right now, particularly politically, is that solar and wind require, or seem to require, a lot more land than coal and gasoline. I’ve seen a lot of estimates around how much more land they require. You question some of that in the book. So tell me a bit about how you think about the land footprint of an economy that is substantially powered by solar versus the same portion of that economy being powered by coal.

hannah ritchie

Yeah. So there are some studies that say if you take account of the mining, and the transport, and the full life cycle, actually sometimes the land footprint of coal is higher than it is for solar. But the fact that you get for some of these estimates is touch and go would suggest that the land footprint of solar is not massively bigger than it is for coal. The question of land use for these technologies is a perfectly valid one. But I think it’s important to highlight that these are choices. And what I often think is a bit suspicious or people don’t take account of is that there are current land uses that we have that we don’t really question. But as soon as solar and wind come along, the guardrails go up and we shouldn’t build this stuff. To give context, if you were to put solar panels in the U.S. on all of the land that’s currently used to produce biofuels, you could power the U.S. three times over. You would be able to easily decarbonize the U.S. and meet its energy requirements. That land use is a choice, and you can make a different choice.

ezra klein

I’ve never heard that about biofuel production in the U.S. So we’re talking things here like growing corn for ethanol?

hannah ritchie

Yes. Nearly all corn production for ethanol that’s used for road transport.

ezra klein

And we are actually using as much of that as we would need for all solar combined?

hannah ritchie

Yeah. So if you put solar panels on that land, back of the envelope estimates suggest that you could meet the U.S.‘s electricity demand around three times over.

ezra klein

So in some theoretical world, if we just paid off every farmer at above market prices for all the land being used for fairly low output ethanol from corn. We could solve a lot of these problems. I feel like that’s a version of this I’ve not really heard before.

hannah ritchie

I’m not saying this is a solution. I’m not saying we should put solar panels —

ezra klein

No. This is your policy. [LAUGHS]

hannah ritchie

No. I’m just making the point that we raise our eyebrows at the thought of how much land solar would need. But no one thinks about the land that’s currently being used for biofuels, and not particularly productive for U.S. gasoline and cars.

ezra klein

Well, the other version of this is nuclear. So you write in the book that the most land efficient source of electricity is nuclear. Per unit of electricity, it needs 50 times less land than coal, and 18 to 27 times less than solar photovoltaics on the ground. So that’s striking. And nuclear is something that is obviously controversial within the renewable energy debates. Tell me a bit about how you think of nuclear, which on the one hand is very clean, and on the other hand, I think people perceive as very dangerous, and on the third hand, if we had a third hand, really has a quality that wind and solar doesn’t, which is that it can kind of be anywhere and does not require very much land to generate a lot of electricity.

hannah ritchie

Yeah. So I think nuclear energy has a lot of merits, one of the primary ones being land use. If you want to conserve land and produce lots of energy, nuclear is ultimately your best option. It’s low carbon. It is safe. I give figures in the book looking at death rates from different forms of energy per unit of electricity production. And as we discussed earlier, fossil fuels are off the charts because — even if you take climate change out of the picture, even based on local air pollution they’re just vastly more dangerous than nuclear energy.

ezra klein

Well, can you zoom in on that for a minute? Because people have probably heard of two major disasters here, Chernobyl and Fukushima. Can you talk about the death rates of both?

hannah ritchie

Sure. So Fukushima in Japan in 2011, the death toll there — I mean, the direct death toll was zero. No one died in that nuclear disaster. Since then there has been — one of the workers has subsequently died of cancer. And then there are what they call excess mortality deaths from the stress of evacuation, the stress of the event. And they attribute that to several thousand, which is obviously a lot. There is the Chernobyl disaster, and more people died directly from that incident. I think you’re looking at 10, I think maybe up to 50 or 100. It’s very hard to come up with an exact total mortality impact from that disaster. But I looked into a bunch of the research on this, and my estimate is somewhere in the low hundreds. So maybe 300 to 500 people died in total from Chernobyl. But as I said earlier, we have millions dying from fossil fuels, solely from air pollution every single year, even taking out the issue of climate change. So those numbers are just so vastly different that when you crunch the numbers per unit of electricity that we’ve produced from each of these sources, nuclear energy is just vastly safer than fossil fuels. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

I want to talk about land here. Because we’ve been talking about that in terms of energy production, but I also want to talk about it in terms of use. Because how we use land is relevant to climate. It’s relevant to deforestation, which your book talks about, relevant to biodiversity loss, which your book talks about. And I read this statistic every couple of months because of the kind of work I do, and every time I’m just stopped cold by it, which is at roughly percent of ice free land on Earth is used for agriculture. It’s a lot. [LAUGHS]

hannah ritchie

It is a lot.

ezra klein

Walk me through that.

hannah ritchie

Yeah, so if you take the world’s — what we call — well, we call it habitable land. So it’s basically taking away the ice and the kind of barren land that you literally couldn’t use for anything else, and other species couldn’t really use for anything else. Farming uses 50 percent of that. I mean, we produce around 5,000 kilocalories per person per day. Now, that’s around double what the average person in the world actually needs. Obviously, that does not end up on people’s plates. So there’s a massive loss in the chain there. One, just losses in the supply chain or consumer waste. But there are two other big ones. One is that we feed a lot of those calories and crops to animals, and they convert that to meat, but they do it very, very inefficiently. And we also allocate a good chunk to biofuels. And what you find is that around 75 percent, or three quarters, of our agricultural land is this grazing land, and then the other 25 percent is for growing crops.

ezra klein

So how does that grazing land break down by animal?

hannah ritchie

So wild grazing land is basically just cattle, and sheep, and maybe some goats. But stuff like chicken, and pork, and fish, et cetera — I mean, fish where we actually feed them, not out in the ocean, they are not raised on grazing land. They’re raised on land where we grow the crops and then feed them to the animal.

ezra klein

So when you do that calculation sort of virtually everything — because goat and sheep are not major sources of human calories. They exist, but they’re not a huge part of the diet. All of the other meat aside from cattle is actually included in the crop raising calculation.

Greenhouse gas emissions have been falling for about 10 years in the U.S. and Japan, and for even longer in Europe. More recently, they have begun falling in Brazil and Russia. A decade ago, the world was on pace to warm by about 7 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century. Today, the number is closer to 5.5 degrees.

Unfortunately, this progress is still not nearly enough to avoid devastating results, scientists say.

The current scientific consensus is that the world should hold warming to no more than 2.5 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit (or about 1.5 degrees Celsius). Even that will cause substantial damage. But anything more could be catastrophic, with more deadly floods, wildfires and heat waves — as well as destroyed communities, animal extinctions and the potential for geopolitical chaos.

60,2024-12-13,"For Wild Animals, the Bird Flu Disaster Is Already Here","Every spring, more than 200,000 northern gannets — stocky seabirds with dazzling white feathers — journey to the coast of eastern Canada. There, they blanket oceanside cliffs and rocky outcroppings, breeding in enormous colonies before flying back south for the winter.

But in May 2022, as many females were getting ready to lay their eggs, the birds began dying in droves. “Thousands of northern gannets started to wash up on our shores,” said Stephanie Avery-Gomm, a seabird biologist and research scientist at Environment and Climate Change Canada.

The culprit: a bird flu virus, known as H5N1, that had recently arrived in North America. Over the months that followed, the virus raced through the region, killing tens of thousands of northern gannets.

The carnage was “devastating,” Dr. Avery-Gomm said. “You have to harden your heart to work on this kind of scale of mortality.”

Since a new version of H5N1 emerged in 2020, scientists have become increasingly concerned that the virus might set off the next pandemic, infecting people around the globe. But for the world’s wild birds, the prospect of a deadly, uncontained outbreak is not theoretical. The virus has already decimated avian populations around the globe, with body counts that can sometimes be staggering: an estimated 24,000 Cape cormorants killed in South Africa, more than 57,000 pelicans reported dead in Peru.

“The scale of the mortalities is truly unprecedented,” said Johanna Harvey, an avian disease ecologist at the University of Maryland. “There’s nothing comparable historically.”

Wild birds are poorly monitored, and the true global toll remains unknown, as do the long-term consequences. But a few years into the avian outbreak, it is clear that the virus is an unwelcome new danger to animals that are already under intense threat from climate change, habitat loss, overfishing and other human activities.

“This disease isn’t being popped into a lovely, pristine, resilient ecosystem,” said Ruth Cromie, the coordinator of a United Nations task force on avian influenza and wildlife. “This is a disease that is adding pressures to species that are already really up against it.”

She added, “I feel like the worst isn’t done yet.”

62,2021-11-03,A Last Chance to Avert Climate Disaster?,"michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.

[music]

Today: Hundreds of heads of state have gathered in Scotland for what they say may be their last real chance to avoid a climate disaster. I spoke with my colleague, Somini Sengupta, about whether they’re right and if global climate talks like these ever really accomplish anything. It’s Wednesday, November 3.

somini sengupta

Hi.

michael barbaro

Hey, Somini.

somini sengupta

I was rushing from one end of this giant conference center to this quiet corner where I’m at, and I got stuck in a scrum —

[music]

— with I think, John Kerry coming out. And then I got stuck in another scrum with, I think it was Prince Charles, but I’m not really sure.

michael barbaro

That’s a heck of a set of scrums.

somini sengupta

And me trying to squeeze in between, so.

michael barbaro

The adventures of climate reporting.

somini sengupta

Yeah.

michael barbaro

So Somini, I wonder if you could just describe exactly where you are and what you’re seeing all around you.

somini sengupta

So I’m in a giant conference center in Glasgow, officially called the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Climate Change Convention. So it’s called COP26 for short. This is the 26th such session. There are plenary halls where the leaders are giving their speeches. There is a pavilion where every country can set up its own pavilion. And the one from Tuvalu, which is a Pacific island nation, I just walked past it this afternoon. And they have these life-sized polar bears in life jackets. It’s become quite a spot for selfies.

michael barbaro

I think we have to comment on the metaphorical intent of that.

somini sengupta

I believe the metaphorical intent is that the ice is melting. The polar bears need to be rescued.

michael barbaro

Right.

somini sengupta

There’s also a little penguin hanging from a noose above the polar bears.

michael barbaro

Ooh, a darker metaphor.

somini sengupta

Yeah, pretty grim. Rumors has spread that Australia, the Australian pavilion, is serving free coffee. So there is quite a long line there today. So that’s kind of what it looks like, yeah.

michael barbaro

Hmm. Well, as I think those dark scenes you just described hint at, we are at a moment when the climate is in crisis. And despite years and years and years of global talks, despite treaties like the Paris Agreement on climate change that come from those talks, carbon emissions have gotten worse, not better. And extreme climate events are becoming even more destructive, not less. And so I think the question for many people is, what exactly is the point of a conference like this? Haven’t we learned that these global climate talks are not really an effective way to solve the climate problem? And I wonder if you can engage in that skepticism for a moment that these conferences can seem like a lot of pomp and circumstance and empty promises.

somini sengupta

There are some who would look at these climate summits and say, look, you come together every year. And you all make speeches, and you promise various things. They are all voluntary. They are not binding. And in the end, you’re not doing what the science demands, which is to pivot really quickly away from burning coal, oil and gas to limit the rise in global average temperatures. And so the frustration that you hear is, this is all a bunch of talk, and there’s not enough action.

michael barbaro

OK, and what’s the optimist’s case — the argument for seeing a conference like this as important, as meaningful and ultimately, impactful?

somini sengupta

Right, so another way of asking that is, why bother when things are so bad? Well, the argument you will often hear is precisely because things are bad, and they could be much worse, is why you need a summit like this. The future is not pre-written. It’s up to the big powerful countries that are gathered here to determine what kind of future is going to be most likely. The point of this summit is for the leaders of those big polluter countries, and for everyone else who is affected by climate change, to gather in one place, to nudge each other to do better, and to hold each other to account. The whole thing is built on this system of diplomatic peer pressure.

michael barbaro

OK, so with that in mind, these two arguments about this conference, what has actually happened at this conference so far? I know we’re just a few days into it, but they’ve been meaningful days.

somini sengupta

So the conference began Sunday. And in a way, the conference really began with this other meeting which happened in Rome. And that’s where the world’s 20 biggest economies, the G20 — which are also the 20 biggest polluters — were meeting. And they were trying to come to an agreement on what they’re willing to do to address climate change. And they actually took some incremental steps. Probably key among them was that they agreed to, quote unquote, “pursue efforts” to keep a very key temperature threshold within reach. And that threshold is to limit the average global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees Celsius between pre-industrial times and the end of this century.

michael barbaro

And why does that pledge matter so much? Because that feels like a familiar pledge.

somini sengupta

Well, that is one of the goals of the Paris Agreement. It is increasingly an important North Star because after you get past 1.5 degrees, the likelihood of the really, really bad stuff goes up significantly. That’s the scientific consensus. And right now, by the way, we are on track to rise by about 3 degrees Celsius. So after this meeting in Rome, where they commit themselves to 1.5, they all fly from Italy to Glasgow.

And these are really reminders to everyone else in the hall about what’s at stake.

archived recording Honorable guests, this brings us to the end of our national statements.

michael barbaro

And what are you thinking as you’re watching these speeches, especially from the smaller island countries?

somini sengupta

I mean, I’ve covered several international summits convened by the United Nations like this one. And it strikes me every time that this is where countries, big and small, rich and poor, powerful and almost never heard from, if you are in the U.S., they all get the same airtime. They all stand at the same podium. They negotiate with each other. It is the ultimate platform for global collective action, and in this case, on a really, really big and high-stakes global problem.

michael barbaro

So this would be another argument for the optimists’ version of why these conferences matter?

somini sengupta

As a realist, I can tell you that a summit like this is where the Davids and the Goliaths in the world among nations, they sit at the same table. They egg each other on. They pressure each other. It’s not a one-way street. It’s not the powerful pressing only small, vulnerable countries. It’s also the other way around. And it’s where the leader of really powerful, big, rich countries like Germany or the United States have to hear the leader of Fiji or the leader of Barbados tell them, this is your moment to lead.

michael barbaro

Or blame them for things that have gone terribly wrong.

somini sengupta

That, too.

[music]

michael barbaro

But of course, the big question is, are those large, wealthy nations going to actually act? Are they going to make commitments and keep them in ways that benefit those small, vulnerable countries?

somini sengupta

Precisely.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Somini, what kind of commitments and pledges are actually made at this conference?

somini sengupta

Right, so has this summit produced in the first three days a coherent global plan to exit fossil fuel extraction and use? No. But have there been significant steps announced in these last couple of days? Yes. First, the United States has led this effort to persuade something around 90 countries to sign on to a pledge — again, a voluntary pledge — to cut methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. OK, and why does that matter? How big a deal is it?

somini sengupta

It matters because methane warms the atmosphere super fast. It’s produced in oil and gas operations and trash landfills and all kinds of things. Now, we’ll have to see how countries fulfill that pledge. They’re going to have to go back and change their rules and regulations, or maybe there are laws to actually reduce their methane emissions. And notably, there are a lot of key countries that are not on board with this so-called global methane pledge.

michael barbaro

Like?

somini sengupta

So Russia is not on board — a major oil and gas producer — nor is China, nor India, nor Australia.

michael barbaro

Those are some pretty big gaps in that agreement.

somini sengupta

Yes, so some pretty big gaps there.

michael barbaro

OK, what else?

somini sengupta

The other big global accord that we heard about today was a commitment to end deforestation by 2030. So about 100 countries signed onto this. It includes Brazil, which, of course, contains a big chunk of the Amazon, the lungs of the planet. It includes Russia, which has some really important big boreal forest. It includes China. But this is all a bit of a deja vu because in 2014, world leaders promised to reduce deforestation by half by now. And they promised to eliminate deforestation entirely by 2030, which is exactly what the accord announced today says. In fact, since that pledge, deforestation actually accelerated. So let’s see if second time around, world leaders will actually keep their promise.

michael barbaro

So, in theory, we should be quite skeptical of this pledge, because this pledge was made in the past and not kept.

somini sengupta

In theory, we should be skeptical of all pledges, because all pledges are voluntary. And what matters is how they achieve those pledges.

michael barbaro

Got it. So, Somini, taken together, if kept, how would these two pledges on methane and on deforestation, how much progress would that represent when it comes to 1.5 degrees and keeping warming beneath that threshold?

somini sengupta

Both the methane pledge and the deforestation pledge are significant, but taken together, they are not going to be sufficient to reach the 1.5 threshold.

michael barbaro

OK, so those are multi-country agreements. What about individual countries? What kind of pledges and promises did they make, relating to 1.5 degrees?

somini sengupta

There were two significant individual country pledges. The first one came from the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. He said India would significantly ramp up renewable energy production and that by 2030, 50 percent of its energy mix would come from renewable energy. This was rather vague with very few specifics. And there was a lot of head-scratching, but still a significant commitment by a big emerging economy to ramp up renewable energy sources. He did not, however, say anything about the main source of electricity in India, which is burning coal. And he didn’t say anything about India’s coal use. However, on Tuesday, from South Africa came a very important announcement about that. South Africa said that it would begin to plot its exit from coal. And it announced a sort of transition plan. The reason why this is important is that South Africa is the first big emerging economy to say, yep, we’re going to exit coal, and this is how we’re going to do it. And this commitment could send a very important signal to other emerging economies about how an exit from coal can actually happen.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. OK, well, what about China, the United States and Russia, three of the world’s largest and biggest polluters? Did they make any meaningful pledges here?

somini sengupta

The United States had already said early on this year, soon after President Biden took office, it announced its national climate plan or its climate goal. And in it, the United States said it would reduce by about 50 percent its emissions by 2030, compared to the emissions levels in 2005. That’s pretty ambitious. The big question, of course, is: How is this administration going to deliver that target, given that it faces some pretty significant opposition still in Congress on its kind of main climate legislation?

michael barbaro

Right. OK, what about China, and what about Russia?

somini sengupta

China, too, has already said that it would stop funding coal-fired power plants overseas, which is a big deal because China is the biggest funder of coal-fired power plants overseas. However, China has said nothing so far about when it plans to get out of coal at home. It consumes by far the largest share of coal anywhere in the world. And China’s updated climate plan is not that different from its original climate plan, which is that China will continue to grow its greenhouse gas emissions until 2030. That’s China. Russia has announced a rather vague net zero target by 2060. But of course, Russia has no plans at all to rein in the extraction of oil and gas from its territory.

michael barbaro

So when we think of the biggest polluters, the countries that so many of these smaller countries like Barbados and Fiji are looking to for leadership — pleading to for leadership at this conference — how should we be thinking about the impressiveness or ambition of these commitments? They don’t seem that impressive or ambitious in their details.

somini sengupta

Well, in reality, they are nowhere close to the 1.5 degree target.

michael barbaro

Right, so does that mean that this peer pressure model, the purpose of these conferences, is failing? Is this the skeptic’s version of the conference coming to pass?

somini sengupta

Well, let’s truth squad this for a minute, right?

michael barbaro

Please.

somini sengupta

Let’s do a thought experiment and say, well, what if there was no Paris Agreement? And there was no diplomatic forum like this, where countries nudge each other to set better climate targets and report back and submit all this data that journalists like us can study and hold their feet to the fire. Let’s say there wasn’t any of that. So the year before the Paris Agreement was agreed to in 2014, the global average temperature was on track to heat up by nearly 4 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, OK? Where are we now? Well, we are on track to heat up by about 3 degrees Celsius. If all countries meet the targets that they’ve set for themselves, that could go down to about 2.4, 2.5 degrees of warming.

michael barbaro

Right, still bad, but you’re saying not as bad as it could be.

somini sengupta

As my colleagues wrote last week, where we’re at is a better result. It’s still devastating.

michael barbaro

So what’s the lesson of that thought experiment?

somini sengupta

So two lessons. First, that emissions can be reduced, that temperature rise can be limited. And two, that perhaps this whole system, the way the Paris Accord is built around a system of diplomatic peer pressure around which the Paris Agreement is built, can deliver some results. And that is the whole point of why an international climate summit like this is taking place.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. So to return, Somini, to the question we started with, what is the value of a conference like this at this extremely dire stage in our climate history, it sounds like what you’re saying is that this self-evidently imperfect system is a system that does accomplish something. It’s clearly not working as well as everyone would like, but it’s better than the alternative, which is leaving every country to their own devices and hoping that they do the right thing for the climate on their own. Is that the thinking?

somini sengupta

Well, look, what I can tell you is that this is a fundamentally global problem that no leader on its own is in a position to address. So it needs, at its core, global collective action. A conference like this, a summit like this, is the first step in nudging countries, particularly big polluting countries, to do better. The second and most important step is to see if they will, to hold them accountable.

michael barbaro

Right, for which, no doubt, we need another conference.

somini sengupta

That’s right. There will be another climate conference, and I will be covering it.

michael barbaro

Well, Somini, good luck.

somini sengupta

It was a major setback for Democrats in a state that Biden won last year by 10 points. In the race for governor of New Jersey, the contest between Republican Jack Ciattarelli and his Democratic opponent, incumbent Phil Murphy, remained too close to call. Meanwhile, in Boston, Michelle Wu was elected mayor in a nonpartisan election, becoming the first woman and first person of color to lead that city. And finally —

63,2022-09-13,How to Live in California in a Disaster Era,"I can only speak to what’s in front of me, but what I’m seeing is dramatic change in our climate that is resulting in extreme-weather-related impacts. We just came through a heat dome of unprecedented duration and intensity. We have hot summers, I get it — I went to U.C. Davis — and we’ve seen crazy extreme weather conditions. But I don’t think this is an anomaly. This is the new normal.

So should Californians be making a run for it?

California isn’t falling off the face of the earth, and California isn’t collapsing. The beauty, the diversity, the complexity, all of those things make us strong but also make us challenging.

But I wonder when I see the heat events we’re having: How bad is that going to get in the future? What does this drought look like in the future? Look at other parts of the world that have had similar heat and drought patterns — they essentially dried up and became very difficult places to live. Based on my experience, in actual events over the last 10 years, it’s getting worse, not better. And we all have a part to play in that.

So how do we cope, if we aren’t going to leave?

Part of it is reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But it’s also being prepared. Those who understand that will best navigate a disaster. They’ve thought through their insurance. They’ve thought through their family plan. They’ve thought through their communications plan. We have a great tool called My Hazards, where you can just type in your address and it will help you plan.

But it’s not just natural disasters. Emergencies happen when you least expect them. You could be in the middle of an active shooter situation. Or all of a sudden there’s a bomb threat. Or hazardous materials across the street. How do you handle that? When you walk into a facility, do you know where the exits are? Is there a back door? If the lights go out, do you know where to go?",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.5621,['United States'],['Davis']
64,2021-09-02,Corporate America Is Lobbying for Climate Disaster,"Why does Mickey Mouse want to destroy civilization?

OK, that’s probably not what Disney executives think they’re doing. But the Walt Disney Company, along with other corporate titans, including ExxonMobil and Pfizer, is reportedly gearing up to support a major lobbying effort against President Biden’s $3.5 trillion investment plan — a plan that may well be our last chance to take serious action against global warming before it becomes catastrophic.

To say what should be obvious, the dangers of climate change are no longer hypothetical. The extreme weather events we’ve recently seen around the globe — severe drought and forest fires in the American West; intensified hurricanes, catastrophic flooding in Europe; heat waves pushing temperatures in the Middle East above 120 degrees — are exactly the kinds of thing climate scientists warned us to expect as the planet warms.

And this is just the beginning of the nightmare — the leading edge of a wave of disasters, and a harbinger of the crisis heading our way if we don’t act quickly and forcefully to limit greenhouse gas emissions.

What can be done to avoid catastrophe? Many economists favor broad-based incentives to limit emissions, such as a carbon tax. There’s an interesting, serious economic debate over whether that’s really the best policy, or at any rate whether emissions taxes would be a sufficient policy on their own. As a practical matter, however, that debate is moot: Carbon taxes, or anything like them, won’t be politically feasible any time soon.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,0,-0.948,['United States'],[]

According to a study by Policygenius, an online insurance marketplace, U.S. insurers paid out $99 billion in claims related to natural disasters in 2022. As a result, premiums rose by an average of 21 percent from May 2022 to May 2023, dwarfing the 12 percent increase during the previous year. The study examined more than 17,000 policies renewed with Policygenius across 46 states and Washington, D.C., omitting four states where adequate data wasn’t available.

Rates increased by an average of 35 percent in Florida, the most of any state. Hurricane Ian, which hit in late September, turned out to be the costliest hurricane in the state’s history. In Idaho, where many homes are vulnerable to wildfires, owners paid an average of 31 percent more. Colorado, South Dakota, Louisiana and Texas also saw marked rate increases as residents confronted more losses from natural disasters and fewer insurance options.

The worst fallout is still in western North Carolina, where, in addition to the mass wreckage of destroyed buildings, teams are searching for dozens of missing people, some areas have no potable water, cellphone communication remains spotty, more than 170,000 customers still don’t have power, and hundreds of roads are closed.

67,2023-08-30,Falsehoods Follow Close Behind This Summer’s Natural Disasters,"As natural disasters and extreme environmental conditions became more commonplace around the world this summer, scientists pointed repeatedly to a shared driver: climate change.

Conspiracy theorists pointed to anything but.

Some claimed falsely that the record-smashing heat waves blistering parts of North America, Europe and Asia were normal, and that they had been sensationalized as part of a globalist hoax. Others made up tales that cloud-seeding airplanes or a nearby dam, rather than torrential rains, had caused the unusually intense flooding in northern Italy (and in places like Vermont and Rwanda).

The devastating wildfire on Maui this month produced especially ludicrous claims. Social media that racked up millions of views blamed the blaze on a “directed energy weapon” (the evidence: years-old footage not recorded in Hawaii). And as Florida braced this week for Hurricane Idalia, some people claimed incorrectly online that such storms are not affected by fossil fuel emissions.

The unfounded claims that now regularly follow natural disasters and dangerous weather, contradicting a preponderance of scientific evidence, can often seem frivolous and fantastical.

There were fire tornadoes in the American West; a slow-moving hurricane drowned northwest Florida; children in Silicon Valley breathed a bit of the foul air that children in the shanties of Delhi grow up with.

In other words, the year climate change took center stage as a problem that also affects the richest country in the world, not just low-lying islands of the Pacific and arid swaths of Africa.

It was also a year of big promises.

Two of the world’s three biggest economies, China and the European Union, pledged to act more quickly to cut their emissions of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. And climate change became an issue in the United States presidential race. When asked recently about the links between global warming and the fires racing across California, President Trump said, “I don’t think science knows,” even though scientists say the connection is inextricable.

The numbers, issued on Thursday, paint a more complete picture than ever before of the lives of these people in the aftermath of disasters. More than a third said they had experienced at least some food shortage in the first month after being displaced. More than half reported that they had interacted with someone who seemed to be trying to defraud them. And more than a third said they had been displaced for longer than a month.

The United States experienced 28 disasters last year that each cost at least $1 billion. But until recently, the number of Americans displaced by those disasters has been hard to estimate because of the nation’s patchwork response system.

A couple of days later, at Axios, the climate reporter Andrew Freedman echoed that warning: “America is staring down a summer of disasters.”

The season is now only half over, and the worst months for California fires, which typically provide the most harrowing images of the summer, still lie ahead. But the calendar has already been stuffed with climate disruption, so much so that one disaster often seemed layered over the last, with newspaper front pages almost identical across the Northern Hemisphere. In July, Carbon Brief’s Simon Evans began compiling them on Twitter, running out of steam when he got past 100. Climate segments of newscasts cut quickly from one part of the world to another, telling almost identical stories, day after day.

And yet the mood of those newscasts — in which warming is shown clearly to be blanketing the world, country by country — has mixed horror with a reluctant acceptance. Climate change is here, you think, your mind perhaps drifting past what can be done to limit future warming and toward what can be done to manage living in that future. The disruptions are large already, and arriving as prophesied — indeed, often earlier than predicted. They’ve also been normalized enough that, alongside the shock, they raise practical questions.

The term for this is “adaptation,” and the wallpaper texture of the climate news cycle this summer — with once-horrifying impacts now seeming commonplace — suggests that efforts to acclimate to new realities are following quite quickly on the footsteps of alarm.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,-0.97,['United States'],['Union']

72,2023-08-16,How a Small Group of Firms Changed the Math for Insuring Against Natural Disasters,"As disasters like the wildfires that devastated the Hawaiian town of Lahaina and the storms that tore apart roofs from Alabama to Massachusetts last week intensify, insurance companies have pulled back from offering coverage in certain areas or cut the kinds of damage they will pay to repair.

A little-noticed slice of the financial industry that provides insurance to insurers, called reinsurance, has helped drive the changes.

These companies promise to step in with cash — usually huge amounts — when something like a hurricane, a wildfire or another big disaster creates damage that is too costly and widespread for insurance companies to pay for on their own. And at the beginning of the year, nearly all of them raised prices.

In the weeks leading up to Jan. 1, when about half of reinsurance policies are renewed for the year, reinsurers broke the news to insurance companies across the United States and Canada — from large national carriers like State Farm and Farmers to smaller, more specialized firms — that their prices were going up. That led to a flurry of tense negotiations between those insurers and firms, like Swiss Re, Odyssey Re and other reinsurers, many of which have headquarters outside the United States.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.7351,"['United States', 'Canada']",[]

The river’s water level is at heights not witnessed since 1911, the Dutch national broadcaster NOS reported.

That is no small thing in a water-logged country where taming water has been a matter of survival for centuries and the imperative to keep levels under control is inextricably bound up with Dutch identity. Much of the country sits below sea level and is gradually sinking. Climate change has also exacerbated the twin threats of storms and rising tides.

After the nearby Hawkesbury River had flooded in March last year, for the first time in decades, and inundated his restaurant, Mr. Osmotherly, known as “Oz,” had floodproofed his Paradise Cafe. He put all his equipment on wheels and widened the restaurant doors so that he could get it out more easily. He thought he’d done everything he could to prepare for a similar flood this year.

The list, compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, includes the fire in Maui that killed at least 115 people, the deadliest United States wildfire in more than a century; Hurricane Idalia, which struck western Florida as a Category 3 storm; and a storm in Minnesota that dropped hail the size of pingpong balls, cutting off power for more than 25,000 homes and businesses.

And that was just last month.

In one sense, the growing cost of disasters is unsurprising. The burning of fossil fuels is causing air and water temperatures to increase, which in turn makes it possible for hurricanes to become stronger, rainfall to become more intense and wildfires to spread faster.

The NOAA data, which tracks the number of billion-dollar disasters in the United States, adjusted for inflation, shows a relatively steady upward march, from three such disasters in 1980 to 22 in 2020.

But a report released on Wednesday uses a different measure: Which parts of the country have suffered the greatest number of federally declared disasters?

That designation is reserved for disasters so severe, they overwhelm the ability of state and local officials to respond. The report finds that disasters like these have become alarmingly common.

From 2011 to the end of last year, 90 percent of U.S. counties have experienced a flood, hurricane, wildfire or other calamity serious enough to receive a federal disaster declaration, according to the report, and more than 700 counties suffered five or more such disasters. During that same period, 29 states had, on average, at least one federally declared disaster a year somewhere within their borders. Five states have experienced at least 20 disasters since 2011.

Since 1980, NOAA has tracked the number of disasters each year that produce damages exceeding $1 billion, controlling for inflation. The previous record was 2020, which saw 22 billion-dollar events. NOAA’s data show a clear upward trend, as the number of severe disasters increases each year.

That rise in billion-dollar disasters over time reflects two long-term shifts, according to NOAA. One is the growing frequency and severity of extreme weather events as global temperatures rise.

84,2021-09-17,The Disaster We Must Think About Every Day,"The last 18 months afforded me space to consider this, because I am one of the millions of people who experienced this pandemic from a place of significant privilege. I could work remotely. I did not have children who needed caretaking, and I could afford the luxuries of self-isolation: a safe, suburban home; stable internet; and food delivery. Because of those privileges, Covid was a big pause in my life, instead of an inflection point in a series of economic disasters brought about by income insecurity or job loss. It gave me time to do some reading and some thinking, which I tried to avail myself of when panic would allow me to think and engage with the written word. I really wanted to start taking seriously the broad charge to be mindful of my impact on the environment, and to examine what a commitment to combating climate change looked like in my daily life.

As I was thinking this through, I had an opportunity to talk with Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson for my podcast with Roxane Gay, “Hear to Slay.” Dr. Johnson has her own podcast all about climate, “How to Save a Planet.” She is a co-founder of the Urban Ocean Lab and the author of a new book about climate change. One of the things she asks a lot is, “Are we screwed?” Which is why I wanted her to join us on our podcast.

I started with some of the same questions that I think she hears all the time: Just how bad is it and what should we be doing? Dr. Johnson said two things that righted my ship and gave me clarity on how an individual is supposed to “be green” when climate disaster is so massive and totalizing.

She started by telling me to pick a thing. You don’t have to do the thing that’s going to solve everything. Pick a thing. Are you going to be the recycling person? Are you going to be the water person? Are you going to defend the beavers? Any of the available choices is fine. You just need to pick a thing. Part of picking your thing is trusting that your fellow human beings, your neighbors on this planet, are also going to pick a thing, and together we’ll pick enough things to start to move the needle.

You do this knowing that individual actions cannot solve the climate crisis. We still need nation-states to enact the double-whammy: common-sense, significant regulation of the fossil fuel industry, combined with long-term infrastructure investment in alternatives to fossil fuels and the conventional food supply chain. But picking a thing does something really important. And it does something really important that is related to the second thing she said that really made an impact on me.

Two people had been killed and over 200 have been injured.

The storm made landfall as a typhoon at 12:40 p.m. in Kaohsiung, a major port city home to 2.7 million people, Taiwan’s Central Weather Administration said. It was downgraded to a tropical storm on Thursday evening, and became a tropical depression on Friday as it moved north over land.

Taitung County, in the southeast, has received up to 4.2 feet of rain since Tuesday, while nearby Pingtung County has received about 3.9 feet in the same period.

Heavy rain triggered multiple landslides in Taitung, Pingtung and the northeastern port city of Keelung. Flooding has also swept Keelung and Kaohsiung.

86,2022-09-07,Pakistan’s Vulnerability to Disaster Was Through the Roof. Then Came the Floods.,"Sometimes a weather event is so extreme and so far-reaching, it can be hard to make sense of, particularly from a distance. A third of Pakistan has been submerged by flooding now for at least a week, leading to image after image and video after video of endless water where homes and roads were meant to be. More than a thousand people have died, with more than a million houses destroyed or damaged. More than 100 bridges have collapsed, and thousands of miles of roads have been damaged. Hundreds of thousands of farm animals have died, and as many as 73,000 women are expected to give birth over the next month without adequate medical support.

Almost certainly, the monsoon rains were made worse by climate change, in part because rapidly melting glaciers contributed, and soon after the most striking images began to circulate internationally, there were calls for climate reparations, with which the world’s rich would compensate the world’s poor for the ravages of warming. (Among those making that call was Pakistan’s outspoken climate minister, Sherry Rehman.) Others argued that flooding of this scale, in a country only very fractionally responsible for global warming, made clear the need for a loss-and-damage system — which is what climate advocates say is a more circumscribed approach to help channel support from the rich countries of the world to those suffering most from climate impacts.

But as with any disaster, climate alone does not tell the whole story, and as the flooding wore on, blame has been spread around more widely. In the Pakistani English-language newspaper Dawn, the columnist Arifa Noor outlined many of the country’s policy and preparation failures in the decade since devastating 2010 floods that killed almost 2,000 Pakistanis, caused billions of dollars in damage and at the time were “the worst natural disaster to date attributable to climate change,” according to ClimateWire. Now “Pakistan has been hit by another calamity, but this time around nature has been even more wrathful,” Noor wrote. “The problem is that climate change is also turning into an excuse,” she went on, adding that “the rains and their intensity are beyond our control; the havoc they wreak is not.”

As the flooding continued, Foreign Policy declared that “bad governance exacerbated Pakistan’s flooding,” listing some long-term mistakes: failing water infrastructure, deforestation, poor drainage systems and dangerous, unregulated construction. But there are immediate needs, as well, of course. “Pakistan is at its nadir of political stability,” the climate scientist Fahad Saeed of Climate Analytics wrote last week, citing the ouster, by a messy 13-party coalition, of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf national government, and the fact that the P.T.I. remains in power at the provincial level. “In a recently called all-parties conference, P.T.I. was not even invited,” he wrote, “a reflection of the political bitterness, even during the time of worst flooding of country’s history.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,1,0,1,-0.9981,['Pakistan'],[]

But the full weight of lost lives will be realized only years from now — and it could number in the thousands.

A paper published in the journal Nature on Wednesday lays out the hidden toll of tropical storms in the continental United States. Looking at 501 events from 1930 to 2015, researchers found that the average tropical storm resulted in an additional 7,000 to 11,000 deaths over the 15 years that followed.

Overall during the study period, tropical storms killed more people than automobile crashes, infectious diseases and combat for U.S. soldiers. It’s such a big number — especially compared with the 24 direct deaths caused by hurricanes on average, according to federal statistics — that the authors spent years checking the math to make sure they were right.

The storms caused $43 billion in losses, almost half the total for all U.S. disasters last year.

In addition to the number of storms, the 2020 hurricane season was unusually devastating because climate change is making storms more likely to stall once they hit land, pumping more rain and wind into coastal towns and cities for longer periods of time, Mr. Rauch said.

The next costliest category of natural disasters was convective storms, which includes thunderstorms, tornadoes, hailstorms and derechos, and caused $40 billion in losses last year. The derecho that struck Iowa and other Midwestern states in August caused almost $7 billion in damage, destroying huge amounts of corn and soybean crops.

Wildfires caused another $16 billion in losses.

90,2021-09-07,Climate Disaster Is the New Normal. Can We Save Ourselves?,"Mitigate, adapt or suffer

Fourteen years ago, a Harvard climate and energy expert, John Holdren, coined a kind of axiom for the three choices climate change posed for humanity: Mitigation — the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions — adaptation and suffering. “We’re going to do some of each,” he said. “The question is what the mix is going to be.”

For years, the policy conversation has rightfully been dominated by the first part of the equation, because, as he explained, “the more mitigation we do, the less adaptation will be required and the less suffering there will be.”

But nations delayed curbing their emissions for so long that global warming is now guaranteed to intensify in the next three decades. And that means that mitigation alone, while still as necessary as ever, is no longer sufficient to prevent suffering: As devastating as recent extreme weather events have been, scientists say the next 30 years will bring even more, hotter heat waves, longer and more intense droughts, and more episodes of catastrophic flooding.

In its 2018 National Climate Assessment, the federal government released a sweeping report of all the ways the United States would need to adapt. Here are just four, courtesy of The Times’s Brad Plumer:

Rethink how we farm: Intensifying drought and extreme heat jeopardizes both the yields of crops and the workers who harvest them. Farmers may have to use more precise irrigation techniques to conserve water, relocate production and invest in climate-controlled buildings.

Build for the future, not the past: The nation’s deteriorating infrastructure — its roads, sewer systems, public transportation, power plants and transmission lines — was built with historical weather conditions in mind, so it can’t just be repaired; it also has to be rebuilt or retrofitted for the weather of the future.

Enlist nature to help: Restoring degraded wetlands and expanding green space can protect cities and coasts from flooding, while planting more trees can reduce urban temperatures and protect people from deadly heat waves.

Expect the unexpected: Earth hasn’t warmed this quickly in tens of millions of years, long before humans even existed. Changes this rapid are likely to bring unpredictable dangers, and the more the world warms, the greater the risk of such surprises, some of which may be irreversible and self-reinforcing.

At the moment, however, there is no national plan for climate adaptation, just as there is no national plan for mitigation. Every year, the federal government spends about $46 billion on recovery from disasters — about seven times what it spends on resilience, as David G. Victor, Sadie Frank and Eric Gesick note in The Times. In many cases, recovery money is spent in ways that increase the risks and costs of climate change by inviting people to build and move into harm’s way.

“When communities are flattened by nature, the nation helps pay for rebuilding — often rebuilding the same infrastructure in the same place, a target for the next disaster,” they write. “Redirecting federal money toward resilience rather than simply rebuilding after disasters will be hard.

Insurers are withdrawing from high-risk areas. People are donating directly to survivors through the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe, although that money largely benefits the wealthy. FEMA is overhauling its programs to help individual disaster survivors, after acknowledging that the current programs often fail to provide adequate support.

It’s unclear how many state and local governments will take FEMA up on its offer to add clean energy to rebuild facilities. After a major disaster, the agency will typically reimburse state, local, tribal or territorial governments 75 percent of the cost of rebuilding or repairing structures like schools, hospitals, fire stations, libraries and other buildings. FEMA has paid for more than 105,000 such projects over the past decade.

That 75 percent reimbursement would now apply to additional costs of adding solar panels and other energy-related improvements, like heat pumps, batteries or energy-efficient appliances. But state or local officials would still need to come up with 25 percent of the cost. And they would not be required to participate.

A spokeswoman for FEMA said it did not have an estimate for how many state and local governments would make use of the new options, which are funded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

John Podesta, a senior adviser for clean energy innovation for President Biden, said the change will make up only a small part of the president’s goal of cutting United States greenhouse gas emissions at least 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

If a Category 4 or 5 storm came ashore near the south end of Galveston Island, it would cause the worst environmental disaster in United States history, and could deal another staggering blow to the U.S. economy and national security, because of the potential loss of military grade jet fuel production.

In its continuing studies to design protection for these facilities, the methodology used by the Army Corps of Engineers substantially restricts the size of storm to be used in the design of protection structures. This methodology is outdated, does not adequately address the environmental and economic risks associated with such storms and does not factor in climate change and its impact on storm intensity.

By contrast, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission accounts for extreme surges in its safety guidance for nuclear plants. The commission has been doing this since 2012, after the Fukushima disaster, when it issued a letter recommending that an estimation of low-risk surges be incorporated into the design and permitting of nuclear power plants.

The comparison of these policies with those currently used by the Army Corps of Engineers is revealing. The nuclear agency evaluates the hurricane surge for a plant near Bay City, Texas, and concludes that it would have to design for a surge of more than 30 feet above sea level.

By contrast, the coastal spine, a set of 14-foot-high barriers and a two-mile-wide gate structure designed by the Army Corps of Engineers to protect the Galveston Bay system (an area comparable to Bay City) is meant to protect against a 17-foot surge at the coast — insufficient for the surge generated by either a Category 4 or Category 5 storm.

Officials in San Francisco, Miami Beach and New York City have said they are likely to delay climate-related projects like sea walls because of the virus, which has slashed tax revenue and increased demands for emergency services, housing and other immediate needs. Washington State has cut funding for resilience projects, and people who work on climate adaptation in other cities and states said they worried about similar cuts.

The delays, which officials described as a necessary response to the fiscal straits that many cities are experiencing, come as the cost of natural disasters continue to rise.

107,2022-10-13,Hurricane Ian Proved Why Ron DeSantis’s Version of Climate Resilience Is a Disaster,"Hurricane Ian has revealed in brutal detail the inadequacy of his approach.

The sea walls, sewage pump stations, wastewater treatment plants and “living shorelines” that taxpayers funded did little to help inland towns like Arcadia. Hundreds of Central Florida homes remain flooded two weeks on, as rivers flush out the heavy rain. One study found that climate change may have added 10 percent to Ian’s rainfall.

Protecting Florida from the effects of future storms like Ian calls for more than just resilience. It calls for carefully retreating from the rising water and rebuilding where it’s safe. But retreat has never been in Governor DeSantis’s plan. There has been little to no attempt by his administration to stop further development in vulnerable coastal areas. As recently as August, Mr. DeSantis and his cabinet approved a high-rise resort development in Fort Myers Beach, where evacuation times already exceeded state regulations.

Expensive resilience projects like the ones the governor has supported can only ever be a temporary fix. As the sea level rises, they will have to be replaced, made higher, built larger. A bridge that’s been raised by a foot will have to be raised another foot and then another. The same goes for the sea walls and other infrastructure. They don’t address the cause of climate change, only the symptoms, and only for a little while.

If Governor DeSantis ever gets serious about a changing climate, the place to start is with the emissions that are also driving Florida’s other dangerous impacts: the intensifying heat waves that put outdoor workers at risk of dehydration and death, the warmer ocean waters causing rapid intensification of storms like Ian and the toxic algae blooms, which are also exacerbated by pollution.

The governor has gone in the other direction.

That makes it especially important to keep enough medication on hand if you have a condition like asthma.

It’s also a good idea to have basic emergency supplies in your car if you live in a danger zone. They should include water, nonperishable food and a flashlight. The American Red Cross has more detailed guidelines on its website. The Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends stocking your kit with enough food and water for three days.

If you have pets, you’ll need food and water for them, too.

There are also home maintenance precautions you can take, depending on the risks in your area. If you live in a wildfire zone, clear the area within 30 feet of your house of brush and debris that could ignite and accelerate a fire. If you’re in a hurricane zone, now is a good time to unclog your rain gutters.

Les Cayes

A number of homes and school buildings were damaged in Les Cayes, a seaport community about 20 miles from the earthquake’s epicenter. Local hospitals were quickly overwhelmed, and a very limited number of doctors and surgeons worked through the night to triage victims. Temporary operating rooms near the main airport in Les Cayes were erected, as people tried to evacuate their loved ones to Port-au-Prince for emergency care.

Even before the quake, living conditions had been unstable for many Haitians as the pandemic added to severe poverty, gang violence and political trauma — the still-unsolved July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.

The earthquake also destroyed several churches that have served as sources of aid and stability to surrounding communities, especially to those that receive little support from the government.

Perhaps just as terrifying from both a health and an economic perspective is a predicted continued rise in obesity, including severe obesity, among American adults.

A prestigious team of medical scientists has projected that by 2030, nearly one in two adults will be obese, and nearly one in four will be severely obese. The estimates are thought to be particularly reliable, as the team corrected for current underestimates of weight given by individuals in national surveys. In as many as 29 states, the prevalence of obesity will exceed 50 percent, with no state having less than 35 percent of residents who are obese, they predicted.

Likewise, the team projected, in 25 states the prevalence of severe obesity will be higher than one adult in four, and severe obesity will become the most common weight category among women, non-Hispanic black adults and low-income adults nationally.

This Grain Should Be the Next Quinoa.,"In 1999, Ruth Reichl, then the editor in chief of Gourmet, asked me if I would travel around Ethiopia, the country of my birth, with a writer for the magazine. I hadn’t been back since my Swedish parents adopted me when I was about 2 years old, and when the plane touched down there, I was overcome with emotion.

Everything was both unfamiliar and yet so comfortable. My first time walking through the open-air market in the capital, Addis Ababa, the sights and smells of spices, herbs and grains overwhelmed me. I picked up a handful of millet and wondered how toasting it might bring out its earthiness, or how slow-cooking it in a rich broth could make it creamy like risotto. This was the start of a decades-long obsession with the foods of my ancestors and my attempts to bring them into my home and onto my menus.

In the years since my trip, climate change has made it far more difficult to grow food in many parts of Africa (and beyond). Months of heavy rain and flooding have battered East African farmland, while blazing heat and drought in southern Africa have left farmers with little to harvest.

But a handful of African grains are well suited to difficult planting conditions. Millet, sorghum and teff are delicious, nutritious and quick to grow, even after natural disasters. Pearl millet, a staple throughout sub-Saharan Africa, can grow in both waterlogged and barren soil. Teff is an ancient grain used in injera bread that provides up to two-thirds of Ethiopia’s protein and dietary fiber. It can regrow even after extreme drought. Fonio, a grain from West Africa, is part of the millet family. It’s rich in iron, B vitamins and calcium.

By moving vast quantities of water and suppressing wildfires for decades, the state has transformed its arid and mountainous landscape into the richest, most populous and bounteous place in the nation.

But now, those same feats have given California a new and unwelcome category of superlatives.

This year is the state’s worst wildfire season on record. That follows its hottest August on record; a punishing drought that lasted from 2011 to last year; and one of its worst flood emergencies on record three years ago, when heavy rains caused the state’s highest dam to nearly fail, forcing more than 180,000 people to flee.

The same manufactured landscapes that have enabled California’s tremendous growth, building the state into a $3 trillion economy that is home to one in 10 Americans, have also left it more exposed to climate shocks, experts say.

The country’s vulnerability in the face of extreme weather was punctuated by the downpour that flooded the country’s largest city. New York City has invested billions of dollars in storm protection since Hurricane Sandy in 2012, investments that seemed to do little to blunt the impact of the deluge.

Rain poured down in furious torrents, turning the subway system into a kind of flume ride. Central Park recorded 7.19 inches of rain, nearly double the previous record set in 1927 for the same date, according to the National Weather Service, which issued the city’s first-ever flash flood emergency alert.

Ahead of the storm, city and state officials activated preparation plans: clearing drains, erecting flood barriers in the subway and other sensitive areas, warning the public. But the rainfall dumped more water, and faster, than what the city factored into its new storm water maps as an “extreme” flood event.

The pattern of damage reflects the relationship between climate exposure and racial inequality: impacts were more apparent in low-income communities of color, which, because of historic inequalities, are more prone to flooding, receive less maintenance from city services, and frequently experience lax housing code enforcement.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,commentary,0,0,1,-0.8589,['United States'],['New York']

Over the next 30 years, 7.5 million more are projected to leave those perennially flooded zones, according to the study.

All of this suggests a possible boom for inland and Northern cities. But it also will leave behind large swaths of coastal and other vulnerable land where older adults and the poor are very likely to disproportionately remain.

The Southern United States stands to be especially transformed. Extreme heat, storms and coastal flooding will weigh heavily on the bottom third of this country, making the environment less comfortable and life within it more expensive and less prosperous.

The young, mobile and middle class will be more likely to leave to chase opportunity and physical and economic safety. That means government — from local to federal — must now recognize its responsibility to support the communities in climate migration’s wake. Even as an aging population left behind will require greater services, medical attention and physical accommodation, the residents that remain will reside in states that may also face diminished representation in Congress, because their communities are shrinking. Local governments could be left to fend alone, but with an evaporating tax base to work with.

In December, the First Street Foundation created one of the first clear pictures of how this demographic change is unfolding. It looked at flood risk and migration patterns down to the census tract, across the country, and identified hundreds of thousands of so-called abandonment zones where the out-migration of residents in response to rising risk had already passed a tipping point, and people were making small, local moves to higher ground.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,0.9105,['United States'],"['Staten Island', 'Miami', 'Texas', 'Galveston']"

Here’s How to Optimize Your Coverage.,"In 2016, when Shawn Loht bought his house near New Orleans, he easily found homeowner insurance with a $2,000-a-year premium. “It was just lickety-split,” he said. But after Hurricane Ida, a Category 4 storm, barreled through Louisiana in 2021, his premium jumped to $6,109. Then his provider failed, leaving him facing a premium of nearly $13,000 a year from the state’s insurer of last resort.

“We were on the verge of being priced out of our home,” said Mr. Loht, 42, a research manager at a local community college.

Mr. Loht’s experience has become increasingly common as insurance companies react to cascading natural disasters by raising rates, reducing coverage and exiting some markets entirely. Last month, State Farm, the largest insurer in California, announced that it would stop issuing new home insurance policies in the state, signaling that more of the costly wrath of climate change is landing on homeowners. And Allstate, the state’s fourth largest insurer, quietly stopped selling new home, condominium and commercial insurance policies last year, confirming the change to The San Francisco Chronicle last week.

“We should absolutely be nervous that this could happen regardless if you live in California or if you live in Northern Colorado or a place like Nebraska or northern Mississippi,” said Pat Howard, a home insurance expert at Policygenius, an online insurance marketplace. “These disasters are wiping out large swaths of homes and insurance companies are responding in kind by getting out of there.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,0,-0.9129,[],['New Orleans']

The building is a reminder of how much Taiwan has prepared for disasters like the magnitude-7.4 earthquake that jolted the island on Wednesday. Perhaps because of improvements in building codes, greater public awareness and highly trained search-and-rescue operations — and, likely, a dose of good luck — the casualty figures were relatively low. By Thursday, 10 people had died and more than 1,000 others were injured. Several dozen were missing.

“Similar level earthquakes in other societies have killed far more people,” said Daniel Aldrich, a director of the Global Resilience Institute at Northeastern University. Of Taiwan, he added: “And most of these deaths, it seems, have come from rock slides and boulders, rather than building collapses.”",,5,Earthquake_Tsunami_MajorEvents,natural disaster,4,0,1,-0.9555,"['China', 'Taiwan, Province of China']",[]
129,2020-02-23,"The Fires Are Out, but Australia’s Climate Disasters Aren’t Over","Warmer temperatures do more than just dry out the land. They also heat up the atmosphere, which means clouds hold more moisture for longer periods of time. So droughts get worse, giving way to fires, then to crushing rains that the land is too dry to absorb.

One result of that multiplier effect for Australia — a global bellwether for climate change’s effects — is that rebuilding after a disaster becomes far more complicated. Many Australians in disaster zones complain that their government, after dismissing climate change for years, has yet to outline recovery plans that are clear and that take future threats into account.

At the same time, the economic costs of a changing climate are skyrocketing. Philip Lowe, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, warned recently that Australia was already paying a price, and that it would only go up.

“Addressing climate change isn’t something that is any responsibility of the Reserve Bank of Australia, but what we do have a responsibility to do is to understand the economic and the financial implication of climate change,” he said. “The economic implications are profound.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,-0.7834,['Australia'],[]

Oceanic sharks and rays have declined by 71 percent since 1970, mainly because of overfishing. The collapse is probably even more stark, the authors point out, because of incomplete data from some of the worst-hit regions and because fishing fleets were already expanding in the decades before they started their analysis.

“There is a very small window to save these iconic creatures,” said Nathan Pacoureau, a marine biologist at Simon Fraser University in Canada and the study’s lead author. More than three quarters of oceanic shark and ray species are now threatened with extinction, jeopardizing marine ecosystems and the food security of people in many nations.

Leacock first considered making a game about climate change in August 2019 after a British academic sent him an email suggesting that he tweak Pandemic to make it about that theme. Leacock dismissed the notion, he said, “but then another person reached out with that idea, then another person.”

Last March, he decided to give it a go. So as much of the world went into lockdown and looked for escapist entertainment, he began reading extensively on climate change.

“I immediately fell into a big trough of despair,” Leacock said. “Climate crisis books are a rough bunch, in that they all start with laying out the crisis, trying to make you realize the gravity of the situation.”

The regulations for the first time tell facilities to explicitly address disasters, such as storms or floods, that could trigger an accidental release, including threats linked to climate change. For the first time, chemical sites that have had prior accidents will need to undergo an independent audit. And the rules require chemical plants to share more information with neighbors and emergency responders.

“We’re putting in place important safeguards to protect some of our most vulnerable populations,” Janet McCabe, Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, told reporters ahead of the announcement.

Administration officials called the stronger measures a step forward for safety at a time when hazards like floods and wildfires — made more extreme by global warming — pose a threat to industrial sites across the country.

Populism May Take Us All the Way Down.,"When water mixes with dirt it becomes mud, tons of mud, the kind of mud that, in the wake of flash floods on Oct. 29 and 30, has turned the Spanish region of València into a kind of war zone. More than 200 people are dead; nearly 90 are still missing; hundreds of houses, roads and railways are destroyed; and towns are cut off without electricity, water, or provisions. Hundreds of families have lost everything. Large swaths of the region have been transformed into a brown hell, reeking of decay, after rivers topped their banks, sending water coursing through towns and cities.

But there is more than one kind of mud.

When administrative incompetence mixes with political partisanship, as has happened here, then another kind of mud emerges: populism. In this catastrophe, those anti-government forces that have been swirling in the dark edges of Spanish politics for years are now feeding on the many levels of incompetence of the state, and the absence of an effective public response by regional or national authorities.

Right now both València and Spain, mired in this morass, are at risk of being engulfed by the zeitgeist undermining so many Western democracies — and summarized in the slogan that quickly emerged on Spanish social media after the floods: “Only the people save the people.” It is the old trick of populism: confronting established institutions with the philosophical falsehood of the peoples’s purity; the idea that the average citizen is more capable at solving the problems of society than the government is.

I was born here. I grew up here. I belong to a people — the Valèncian people — with an almost pathological obsession with water due to our history of severe droughts and torrential autumn rains. Water turned us into one of the main agricultural regions of the Mediterranean and enriched us with the export of our oranges, one of the largest sources of foreign currency in Spain during the years of Francisco Franco’s dictatorship. We had little industry but we had water, and that allowed us to survive. However, in this century, with the acceleration of climate change, we are increasingly vulnerable to flooding and brutal weather events, such as the recent torrential rains that have caused the destruction of the area around València, a destruction that now threatens to also be political.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,natural disaster,1,0,0,-0.995,"['United States', 'Spain']",[]

The power plant, built in a predominantly Black and Vietnamese area of the city already populated with junkyards, truck stops and a NASA facility, was sold as a down payment on energy resilience — a guarantee that, even if storms cut off connections to the rest of the electrical grid, the city would be able to swiftly fire up its own power plant and send electricity to hospitals, nursing homes and at least some of the neighborhoods sweltering through the aftermath of a powerful summer storm.

It goes like this: Once enough of the ice sheet’s floating edges melt away, what remains are immense, sheer cliffs of ice facing the sea. These cliffs will be so tall and steep that they are unstable. Great chunks of ice start breaking away from them, exposing even taller, even more-unstable cliffs. Soon, these start crumbling too, and before long you have runaway collapse.

152,2022-09-14,China Is Writing the Story of the Climate Future,"But it isn’t only lack of information that blinds us. An unprecedented climate episode in China is also hard for Americans to process because the country occupies such an unsettled role in the stories we tell ourselves, and try to tell the world, about warming — often moralistic ones, about good actors and bad, guilt and innocence. When extreme weather strikes China, the “meaning,” beyond the obvious one, is more muddled. If we don’t know what to make of China, the climate actor, we have a much harder time making sense of its climate suffering.

For years, China has served as a convenient rhetorical touchstone for the climate-minded on both left and right — often described as a bad actor and unreliable partner by climate and energy nationalists, and by agitated environmentalists as an example of what could be done, climatewise, given a political structure without so many troublesome veto points. These contradictory depictions have always depended much more on casual stereotype than genuine insight. But like any useful talking point, they are also built on something real. China is not just the world’s largest climate polluter but is responsible now for about half of all global coal use and almost a third of all global carbon emissions — a growing share, and more than twice the American contribution. (Though on a per-capita basis, the United States is still doing much worse.)

But if China is doing much more damage now to the future of the climate than any other nation, it is also the case that the country has been the strongest force for clean energy over the past decade. Last year, China installed more renewable capacity than was rolled out in the United States, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa combined. And although the plunge in the price of renewables is often regarded as an authorless global market success story, probably the largest contribution to that price collapse has been investment and innovation in Chinese manufacturing (quite a lot of it under horrifying conditions in Xinjiang).

If the story ended there, it would be confounding enough: China, as a global behemoth, simultaneously playing hero and villain. But China also seems to occupy a confusing place in the landscape of climate geopolitics because that landscape has shifted lately as well. Ten years ago, or even five, climate diplomacy often meant rhetorical appeals to global cooperation mixed with realpolitik efforts to move more slowly than your rivals. Today, decarbonization is still happening much too slowly, but fast enough to move the diplomatic dynamics away from a rivalry of inaction toward an apparent rivalry of action. Climate investment is booming in the United States, and with the CHIPS act and the I.R.A. climate bill now passed into law, the country has affirmatively joined what Politico recently called a new “green-energy arms race.”

The power dynamics are shifting, too, not just in terms of trade deals, saber-rattling about Taiwan and China’s recent cancellation of bilateral climate talks after Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei. Since the global financial crisis, but especially since the election of Donald Trump and the bungling of the early American pandemic response, those indulging narratives of American decline often looked to China as a forbidding and inevitable successor: endowed with an overwhelming population, directed by a relatively frictionless model of booming state capitalism and unencumbered by the kinds of political dysfunction that seem unavoidable here. The country remains an obvious geopolitical rival, and just passed the United States in one measure of scientific contribution: publishing the world’s most-cited journal papers.

153,2025-01-11,You Don’t Get Disasters Like the Palisades Fire Without Human Failure,"“The city burning is Los Angeles’s deepest image of itself,” Joan Didion wrote way back in the 1960s. And on X and Truth Social and, indeed, Fox News, they were playing the hits, too — the fires were not the result of climate change or an extraordinary wind event meeting an extraordinary drought but the responsibility of Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles and the city’s fire chief, until this point anonymous nationally, who had the audacity to be a woman.

It was a remarkable reversal, conservatives demagoguing California fire disaster, but after the conspiratorial deluge of Hurricane Helene, it need not have been surprising. Had the Los Angeles Fire Department’s budget really been cut? The fire hydrants were dry primarily because of the demand from the fires themselves, it turned out. There had been no political showdown about a fish called a smelt, and the California supply of water did not hang on its fate. The chaparral was not dry because of water policy choices. The order to suspend controlled burns that took place last year — yes, perhaps shortsighted — was given to ensure that firefighters were available to work the line on uncontrolled blazes elsewhere.

But you don’t get disasters of this scale without human failure, too. For years now, watching record-setting fire after record-setting fire, doomscrolling through phone footage of panicked fire-encircled evacuations and clocking the number of new cities visited by eerie and unbreathable clouds of wildfire smoke, it has been easy to mark each new disaster, many unprecedented in our lifetimes, with the scream, “Climate change!” It is also not enough. Decarbonization hasn’t yet solved the risk of catastrophic fire, and more rapid emissions reductions won’t significantly reduce that risk for decades, either. In the meantime, it cannot be the case — must not be — that there was or is nothing more to do.

Global warming has already remodeled the risk landscape in California and well beyond, making gigafire burns and urban firestorms like this one so much more likely. But so has housing policy, which has directed much more development into the path of fire across the vast tinderbox of the American West. The problem of forest management looms larger in Northern California, with decades of fire suppression producing much denser and more flammable forests there, but the job of brush clearing and fuel thinning has been neglected around Los Angeles, too. In a place like Palisades, where the homes became the fuel, a whole program of home hardening is now harrowingly necessary, to make existing homes much less vulnerable even when the embers descend in blankets from miles away.

What would that hardening look like, enacted at the scale of not just a community but a megalopolis, perhaps a whole state or even a continent? The job is in ways both forbidding and banal. Those forests, now intimidating heaps of fuel, must be thinned — in California perhaps almost four million acres annually, nearly equivalent to the state’s worst fire season in modern history. Brushland and scrubland, while trickier, must be managed better, too: when possible, with controlled and traditional burning and, when not, through mechanical thinning and more aggressive use of strategic fire breaks, particularly along ridge lines, and debris clearance, especially in those canyons, like firepits, sometimes called jackpots. On the urban side of the what’s known as the wildland-urban interface, we probably need a program of systematically reducing risk to property by property — retrofitting homes and roofs, eliminating flammable flora, ensuring homes sit clear of anything flammable. Beyond that, some way of overcoming longstanding NIMBYish resistance, explained less by partisanship or climate denial than a more quotidian mix of lack of urgency, homeowner libertarianism and simple wishful thinking.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,-0.9971,[],['Los Angeles']

We tend to focus on the cataclysmic risks of climate change — polar ice caps melting, seas rising dramatically, our planet becoming uninhabitable — and those are real. But over the last couple of decades we’ve accumulated evidence that the more mundane impacts of heat are already upon us, impacting our daily lives. For example, more people fall off ladders on hot days than on cool days. They are more likely to kill themselves. They are also more likely to kill someone else.

Meanwhile, students learn less on hot days. They perform worse on exams. After a natural disaster, students are less likely to go to college.

155,2024-09-09,7 Takeaways From the Seemingly Endless Fire Season,"The Line fire had burned through more than 21,000 acres of Southern California when officials announced Monday morning that it was only 3 percent contained. Amid record temperatures, the blaze quickly ate through dry vegetation, injuring three firefighters and leading to evacuation orders for more than 6,000 people across San Bernardino County.

It’s just one of 67 large wildfires currently burning across more than two million acres of the country. While the end of summer has typically meant a slowdown of major wildfires, climate change has upended that seasonal pattern.

So what’s different about today’s wildfire weather?

‘Whiplash’ Weather Feeds the Fires

The Line fire and others feed on a “whiplash” between very wet conditions and extremely hot conditions.

“It’s arguably the worst climate sequence for the wildfire in Southern California,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. For the past two years, wet conditions have caused vegetative growth that quickly dried out during the coastal heat wave that began last week.

Debby is certainly loaded with a lot of water. One big reason: The waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean have been abnormally hot for months. This warmth causes more of the water to evaporate, providing storms with more moisture to unleash as rain. The extra heat in the ocean also gives storms more energy with which they could potentially generate stronger winds.

But other factors stopped Debby’s winds from intensifying to the highest levels, said Kim Wood, an associate professor of hydrology and atmospheric sciences at the University of Arizona. Before making landfall in Florida this week, the storm crossed Cuba, where the mountainous terrain very likely disrupted the low-level winds that channel energy from the sea surface into the storm.

“The water was plenty warm, but the storm itself had to be organized,” Dr. Wood said.

But it has long been clear that the damage from climate change will gradually build over time, as formerly freakish disasters become bigger and more frequent, as once-in-a-century floods, fires and droughts start happening every few years, affecting ever more people.

The state’s residents have generally paid low home insurance rates — the cheapest in the country, according to Bankrate, a consumer financial services company — because there are relatively few natural disasters in Hawaii, with the private sector on stronger footing than in states like Florida and California. In recent years, both states have been more prone to extreme weather events than Hawaii.

But the deadly fires in Maui this week, which destroyed thousands of homes and will take what the state’s governor said would be billions of dollars to rebuild from, may make insurance companies reconsider policy rates and coverage, as they have in more disaster-prone areas.

Insurance rates are set on a state level, with varying degrees of government regulation and intervention.

It’s not just a local tragedy killing people far away. Natural disasters have struck, and will strike, around the world — including in the United States. What are their repercussions? What lessons can be learned from them?

Perhaps the most salient is this: Bad luck is inevitable and we must anticipate and prepare for it.

To Americans, our first association with earthquakes may be the one that destroyed San Francisco in 1906. It killed an estimated 3,000 people, but there have been at least eight documented earthquakes since the year 1500 with death tolls over 100,000 — including the 1923 Tokyo earthquake that killed 143,000 people, topped by one that killed nearly a million people in China in 1556.

As lethal as earthquakes are volcanic eruptions. Much more deadly than the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption that killed 57 Americans were the eruptions of Vesuvius in A.D. 79, of Krakatoa in 1883, of Santorini that may have undermined Crete’s Minoan civilization and the 1902 eruption that killed about 30,000 people within a few minutes on the Caribbean island of Martinique.",,5,Earthquake_Tsunami_MajorEvents,natural disaster,3,0,0,-0.9941,"['Martinique', 'Syrian Arab Republic', 'Türkiye', 'Finland', 'United States', 'China']","['Tokyo', 'San Francisco', 'Much']"
180,2020-09-04,Americans Back Tough Limits on Building in Fire and Flood Zones,"As global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, decisions about where and how to build have become increasingly important. If local governments continue to allow homes to go up in places most exposed to climate change, such as coastlines, floodplains or fire-prone wilderness, experts say, it will make generations of current and future residents more vulnerable to worsening hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters.

Yet those long-term concerns have typically been outweighed by the demand for new homes, and the jobs and tax revenue that come with them. In many coastal states, the most flood-prone areas have seen the highest rates of home construction since 2010, a study last year found. And in California and elsewhere, officials continue to approve development in areas hit by fires.

“Some of the most vulnerable land also ends up being some of the highest-priced land,” said Otis Rolley, senior vice president at the Rockefeller Foundation and former North America managing director for 100 Resilient Cities, an initiative that worked with cities to better withstand shocks from climate change and other challenges. “There’s a lot of pressure on elected officials.”

A wave of disasters has pushed some cities and counties to limit where they build. The new survey — a joint project of Stanford; Resources for the Future, a Washington research group; and ReconMR, a survey research company — asked whether governments should require that new buildings in risky areas “need to be made in a way that doesn’t get damaged easily by floods.”

The support among Republican respondents was notable considering that fewer than one-third of Republican voters say global warming is a major threat to the United States, according to a Pew Research Center survey from March, and despite the party’s general aversion to new regulations.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.9488,['United States'],['Washington']
181,2023-07-17,Why We Should Politicize the Weather,"And while the rest of America hasn’t gotten that hot, everyone in the Northeast remembers the way smoke from Canadian wildfires led to days of dangerously bad air quality and orange skies.

But extreme weather events have always been with us. Can we prove that climate change caused any particular disaster? Not exactly. But the burgeoning field of “extreme event attribution” comes close. Climate models say that certain kinds of extreme weather events become more likely on a warming planet — for example, what used to be a heat wave we’d experience on average only once every few decades becomes an almost annual occurrence. Event attribution compares the odds of experiencing an extreme event given global warming with the odds that the same event would have happened without climate change.

Incidentally, I’d argue that extreme event attribution gains credibility from the fact that it doesn’t always tell the same story, that sometimes it says that climate change wasn’t the culprit. For example, preliminary analyses suggest that climate change played a limited role in the extreme flooding that recently struck northeastern Italy.

That was, however, the exception that proves the rule. In general, attribution analysis shows that global warming made the disasters of recent years much more likely. We don’t yet have estimates for the latest, still ongoing series of disasters, but it seems safe to say that this global concatenation of extreme weather events would have been virtually impossible without climate change. And this is almost surely just the leading edge of the crisis, a small foretaste of the many disasters to come.

Which brings me back to the “politicization of the weather.” Worrying about the climate crisis shouldn’t be a partisan issue. But it is, at least in this country. As of last year, only 22 percent of Americans who considered themselves to be on the political right considered climate change a major threat; the left-right gap here was far larger than it was in other countries. And only in America do you see things like Texas Republicans actively trying to undermine their own state’s booming renewable energy sector.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,-0.9813,"['United States', 'Italy']",[]
182,2020-06-01,States Warn That Virus May Doom Climate Projects,"WASHINGTON — Connecticut is preparing to build a first-of-its-kind underground flood wall.

Louisiana has broken ground on a new community for people forced to flee a village on its sinking coast, the country’s first government-resettled climate migrants.

Projects in 13 cities and states, which were part of the Obama administration’s push to protect Americans from climate change after the devastation from Hurricane Sandy, are now in jeopardy because of the coronavirus pandemic, state and local officials warn. And they need Republicans in Congress to save those projects.

On Monday, officials told lawmakers that the coronavirus will prevent them from meeting the conditions of a $1 billion Obama-era program for large-scale construction projects that defend cities and states against climate-related disasters. That money must be spent by the fall of 2022.

Missing that deadline, which officials say is likely because of delays caused by the coronavirus, would mean forfeiting the remaining money, scuttling the projects. States and cities have been moving swiftly in the design phases and to secure permits since the Obama administration awarded the funds in 2016. Officials will ask Congress to extend the deadline for construction by three years, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The New York Times.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,1,0,0,-0.5719,[],"['Virginia', 'Obama']"
183,2021-09-23,How Have You Experienced Extreme Weather?,"It was “a summer of disasters.”

As the planet warms, extreme weather events such as wildfires, heat waves, hurricanes, droughts and floods are becoming more common. What extreme weather did you hear about during the summer? Did you experience any yourself?

How do you feel about the dangerous weather occurring around the world? What do these events tell you about where we are in the fight against climate change — and how we should move forward?

In “Overlapping Disasters Expose Harsh Climate Reality: The U.S. Is Not Ready,” Christopher Flavelle, Anne Barnard, Brad Plumer and Michael Kimmelman write:

In Louisiana and Mississippi, nearly one million people lack electricity and drinking water after a hurricane obliterated power lines. In California, wildfire menaces Lake Tahoe, forcing tens of thousands to flee. In Tennessee, flash floods killed at least 20; hundreds more perished in a heat wave in the Northwest. And in New York City, 7 inches of rain fell in just hours Wednesday, drowning people in their basements. Disasters cascading across the country this summer have exposed a harsh reality: The United States is not ready for the extreme weather that is now becoming frequent as a result of a warming planet. “These events tell us we’re not prepared,” said Alice Hill, who oversaw planning for climate risks on the National Security Council during the Obama administration. “We have built our cities, our communities, to a climate that no longer exists.” In remarks Thursday, President Biden acknowledged the challenge ahead. “And to the country, the past few days of Hurricane Ida and the wildfires in the West and the unprecedented flash floods in New York and New Jersey is yet another reminder that these extreme storms and the climate crisis are here,” said Mr. Biden, who noted that a $1 trillion infrastructure bill pending in Congress includes some money to gird communities against disasters. “We need to do — be better prepared. We need to act.”

The article continues:

Damage from extreme weather, and threats to human life, will only increase as the planet warms. For every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit of global warming, the atmosphere holds about 7 percent more moisture, scientists have found. That means much heavier rainfall when storms do occur. Across the continental United States, the heaviest downpours have become more frequent and severe, according to the federal government’s National Climate Assessment. The Northeast has seen 50 percent more rainfall during the heaviest storms compared with the first half of the 20th century.

“More injured people keep arriving, but we do not have enough doctors and nurses,” said Dr. Kyaw Zin, a surgeon at the hospital. “The cotton swabs have almost run out.”

He said the hospital was so jammed with injured people after the 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday that “there is no space to stand.” Phone lines were down so he has not been able to contact his parents. “I’m very worried about my parents,” he added. “But I can’t go back home yet. I have to save lives here first.”

Even before the quake, the health care system in Myanmar had been pushed to its limits. The military junta that has led the country since a 2021 coup has cracked down on doctors and nurses, who have been at the forefront of a nationwide civil disobedience movement that has opposed the regime. Myanmar is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a health worker, according to New York-based Physicians for Human Rights.

Dr. Kyaw Zin said that he was about to start surgery when the earthquake struck. Everybody, including patients, ran outside.

On Friday afternoon, ambulance sirens shrieked. The injured kept coming. Nurses checked on patients in the parking lot, some of whom were hooked up to intravenous drips. People moaned for help. The smell of blood hung in the stifling heat.

The junta said it did not have the full death toll. Damage to infrastructure could hinder access to regions that have already been struggling amid a bloody civil war. The epicenter of the earthquake, the Sagaing region, has been a focus of resistance to military rule.

187,2025-03-28,Myanmar’s Internet Censorship Limits Information About Quake,"After the 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday, the internet was filled with videos, images and social media posts documenting the damage in Thailand.

But across the border in Myanmar, where the devastating quake was centered, there has been a far murkier picture about the scale of the diaster.

Information from Myanmar has been harder to come by in part because of the country’s history of internet censorship. In recent years, the military has repeatedly shut off the internet and cut access to social media, digitally isolating the country from the rest of the world.

The blocks have been intended to thwart dissent and prop up the country’s military rulers. Freedom of the press has also been severely restricted. But in an emergency like the earthquake, where power outages and infrastructure damage can already hinder access to the internet, such restrictions can further limit what information is available and can potentially affect the delivery of aid.

Shortly after the quake, even the government struggled to stay online, as several official websites controlled by the junta were inaccessible.

Myanmar’s military took power in a coup in 2021, seizing control of the country’s telecommunications networks, allowing it to shut down internet access in certain areas and create communications blackouts, according to Access Now, a digital rights organization.

Despite widespread internet blocks, some areas have better connectivity than others. In regions where rebel groups have been fighting against the military, internet is particularly unreliable, with many using the satellite-based service Starlink to get online, said Joe Freeman, a Myanmar researcher at Amnesty International.

The quake struck central Myanmar on Friday around 12:50 p.m. local time, causing damage in cities as far away as Bangkok in neighboring Thailand. The quake hit near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city after Yangon, and a strong aftershock was recorded shortly thereafter.

Mr. Freeman said Myanmar’s internet blocks and censorship policies are surely having an effect on getting information about the extent of the disaster in the country.

“Compare the coverage of the earthquake in Thailand, where tremors and damage have been extensively reported, posted and documented, to Myanmar, where we still don’t have a clear picture of the extent of the damage and loss and may not for some time,” Mr. Freeman said.

The information black hole is a stark contrast to the reality of the country before the coup, when growing numbers of Facebook-addicted smartphone users posted huge amounts of memes, political debates and videos during previous crises, like the spread of Covid and protests against the military coup.",Myanmar's military has shut off the internet and cut access to social media in recent years.

A major, 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck in the South Pacific Ocean on Monday, according to the United States Geological Survey. The quake prompted a brief “Tsunami Threat” for Tonga.

Preliminary reports from the U.S. Tsunami Warning System said tsunami waves were possible for coastlines within about 190 miles of the earthquake’s epicenter, including those on Tonga. The system issued an all-clear notice about an hour later, after a tsunami would have struck had one materialized.

Tsunamis are a series of long waves caused by a large and sudden displacement of water in the ocean, usually from a large earthquake on or below the ocean floor. Tsunamis radiate in all directions from the epicenter and can cause dangerous coastal flooding and powerful currents that can last for hours or days.

The temblor happened at 1:18 a.m. Tonga time about 49 miles southeast of Pangai, Tonga, data from the U.S.G.S shows.

U.S.G.S. data earlier reported that the magnitude was 7.1.

Myanmar’s junta has repeatedly shut off the internet, complicating efforts to determine the full extent of the damage. But modeling by the United States Geological Survey roughly estimates that the death toll is likely to surpass 10,000, and could be much higher.

Earthquakes of this size are rare on the mainland of Southeast Asia. Only three quakes of magnitude 7.7 or greater have struck in or near Myanmar in the last century, according to a U.S.G.S. database.

Collapsed buildings were seen across a vast expanse of Southeast Asia. The quake will without a doubt deepen the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, a country that has been battered in a bloody civil war since 2021.

Here is what the damage looked like in some of the region’s largest cities:

Bangkok

In Bangkok, a 33-story skyscraper under construction collapsed, killing at least three people.

The city’s streets were full of people who were afraid of aftershocks or were not allowed back into their buildings. Traffic was at a virtual standstill.

Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra of Thailand declared Bangkok to be an “area of emergency,” asking residents to evacuate from tall buildings to avoid aftershocks.

Mandalay

In Mandalay, the city closest to the epicenter, the damage may be wide-ranging. A hospital there was overwhelmed with injured people lined up on stretchers, or cardboard, in 100-degree heat.

A bridge on the Irrawaddy River collapsed.

Aftershocks in the region About 11 minutes after the initial 7.7-magnitude earthquake, a strong, 6.4-magnitude aftershock struck the same area, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Quakes and aftershocks within 100 miles The New York Times

An aftershock is usually a smaller earthquake that follows a larger one in the same general area. Aftershocks are typically minor adjustments along the portion of a fault that slipped at the time of the initial earthquake.

Aftershocks can occur days, weeks or even years after the first earthquake. These events can be of equal or larger magnitude to the initial earthquake, and they can continue to affect already damaged locations.

Modeling by the United States Geological Survey estimated that the death toll was likely to surpass 10,000, and that there was a strong possibility of a much higher toll.

The quakes happened on the Hayward Fault, one of a handful of major faults that cut through the San Francisco Bay Area. It may be a little less famous than the San Andreas Fault that ruptured in 1906 and 1989, but seismologists say it’s just as capable of causing the Big One.

In a 2018 report, the U.S.G.S. looked at what would happen if a magnitude 7.0 earthquake occurred on the Hayward Fault and estimated that 800 people would die and 18,000 would be injured from damage to buildings and structures. The cost of property loss and business disruption was estimated to be $82 billion.

The U.S.G.S. called the Hayward Fault among the most dangerous faults in the country because it runs through a densely populated region.

Aftershocks can occur days, weeks or even years after the first earthquake. These events can be of equal or larger magnitude to the initial earthquake, and they can continue to affect already damaged locations.

Two morning earthquakes with magnitudes of at least 3.5 struck near San Francisco on Friday and Sunday, according to the United States Geological Survey.

A 3.5-magnitude earthquake near Concord in the East Bay shook the area on Sunday, two days after a quake of similar magnitude struck in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Francisco on Friday, data from the agency shows. Residents across the region reported mild shaking but no immediate damage from either earthquake.

U.S.G.S. data for both earthquakes earlier reported that each one was as strong as a magnitude 3.7 quake. As seismologists review available data, they often revise the earthquake's reported magnitude and update shake-severity maps.

The location of Friday’s earthquake recalled one of the biggest earthquakes of all time, a 7.9-magnitude quake that nearly destroyed San Francisco in 1906.

Friday’s quake, and its much more powerful relative, likely both occurred along the San Andreas fault, said Robert Skoumal, a research geophysicist at the United States Geological Survey. Preliminary location data from the U.S.G.S. suggested that the two may have shared more than a fault line — both occurred at very nearly the same location, about two miles west of Golden Gate Park.

Mr. Skoumal said it was not possible to determine with certainty whether the two quakes shared precisely the same epicenter because of changes in measuring techniques over the last century. “Back in 1906, we didn't have the best seismic instruments out there,” he said.

Earthquakes of similar size are also fairly common in the area west of San Francisco, he said. “We've had dozens of magnitude threes just over the past several decades along this one little patch,” he said.

And while the risk of earthquakes in the San Francisco area is serious, Friday’s small earthquake did not signal the imminent arrival of a more destructive quake, he said. “I wouldn't say this particular earthquake should make anyone worried,” Mr. Skoumal said.

The interaction of the plates causes a large number of earthquakes, according to Lucy Jones, the former head of natural hazards research at the U.S. Geological Survey.

An earthquake with similar force would have been devastating on the faults that run under highly populated areas of California, such as the Hayward fault that runs through Berkeley, Oakland and many other cities just east of San Francisco, Dr. Jones said.

The tectonic rupture that caused Thursday’s earthquake was almost purely horizontal, meaning that two faults had slid past each other. Scientists call this kind of earthquake a “strike slip,” and it is unlikely to cause major tsunamis. That raised questions about why warnings were sent telling residents they were “in danger” and should move to high ground.

Christine Goulet, the director of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Earthquake Science Center, said in an interview that the area where the earthquake struck is unpredictable.

“Tsunami is a Japanese word,” said Syamsidik, an engineer who now directs the Tsunami and Disaster Mitigation Research Center at Syiah Kuala University in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, and, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.

Some 6,000 aftershocks followed.

The tsunami that rose from this great shifting of tectonic plates reached over 115 feet in some places and ultimately killed about 230,000 people in Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, the Maldives and East Africa. If there had been a natural hazards misery index, it would have registered off the scale.

About one in 28,000 people on Earth perished that day because governments were ill equipped to warn residents and visitors about the coming wave and guide them to safe evacuation routes. India failed to warn people on its eastern coast even after the tsunami wreaked havoc in the Andaman Islands, hours before striking the mainland. In Phuket, Thailand, tourists who were mesmerized by the sudden withdrawal of water roamed the exposed seafloor and then were caught unaware by the rushing water. In the Maldives, men asked women and children to stay indoors, where they could not escape the flooding. The men climbed trees and onto roofs when they heard the roar, leading to a lopsided death toll.

Today people around the world are far likelier to receive a timely warning to evacuate a giant, dangerous wave. But as a Dec. 5 earthquake and (tiny) tsunami off Northern California showed, we can’t rely on just seismic information to generate warnings. That recent tsunami was only about two inches high by the time it reached the coast, but millions of people received a warning, triggering some to evacuate unnecessarily.

225,2024-12-05,What to Do When There’s a Tsunami Warning,"A tsunami is in the news. Here are answers to some common questions about the phenomenon.

What causes a tsunami?

Most tsunamis are caused by earthquakes. When a tectonic plate shifts abruptly, it can displace a “tremendous amount of water,” causing waves to sweep out in all directions “like a ripple in a pond,” said Dave Snider, a tsunami warning coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Not every earthquake in a coastal area will bring about a tsunami, but these waves can have devastating impacts when they strike nearby shores. In rare cases, tsunamis can travel hundreds of miles across oceans at the speed of a jet, causing destruction far away from their points of origin. Tsunamis can occasionally occur in bodies of water other than the ocean, such as a lake.

A tsunami can be imperceptible to someone aboard a boat in the deep ocean. However, tsunami waves grow taller in shallower waters, making them more dangerous as they approach the shore.

Less frequently, tsunamis can be caused by landslides, volcanic activity or other phenomena that displace enough water to create a disturbance. In rare cases, a type of tsunami known as a meteotsunami can be generated by a change in air pressure associated with a weather system. Several people died when a meteotsunami struck Lake Michigan in 1954.",,5,Earthquake_Tsunami_MajorEvents,natural disaster,0,0,0,-0.9846,[],[]

238,2024-04-05,A Look at How Earthquakes Are Measured,"Earthquake strength is registered on what is called the moment magnitude scale, which measures how much energy was released when the rocks along a fault moved during the quake. The magnitude is calculated using data from a network of instruments, called seismometers, that record the energy spreading from the quake’s origin in the form of waves of ground movement.

Until the 1970s, a different scale was used, one developed by an American seismologist, Charles Richter. That scale was found to be inaccurate for very large earthquakes.

The moment magnitude scale is logarithmic — that is, each whole number of magnitude represents about a 30-fold increase in energy released. So a 9.5-magnitude quake — such as the one that occurred in Chile in 1960, the strongest ever recorded — is more than 30,000 times more powerful than a 6.5-magnitude quake, which itself can be very destructive.

The amount of shaking a quake causes is measured on separate scales, such as the Modified Mercalli Scale. That value varies form place to place, and depends on the geography of the area along with the strength and depth of the quake. Using that scale, the U.S.G.S. reported a maximum shake value of just over 6 — or “strong” — near the epicenter on Friday, and that people felt shaking across the region.",,5,Earthquake_Tsunami_MajorEvents,scientific report,0,0,0,0.9186,['Chile'],[]

And then to the north is the Juan de Fuca plate, which is subducting beneath the North American plate.

So more plates mean more motion?

Right. It’s a much more complicated geometry of faults, along with more motion to be accommodated, and that leads to more events.

Is the area getting more active or less active?

People always ask that. It’s neither. We have a magnitude 6.5 earthquake in this region about once a decade.

What was your first thought when Tuesday’s quake hit?

I was excited because we sent out an alert to a huge number of people — it was a great success.

Of course, a lot of people were sound asleep at 2:30 in the morning.

Yes, there was lots of discussion of that on Twitter. But in big earthquakes, about half of injuries are because either people fall over or things fall on people. So if you have just a few seconds to drop, cover and hold on, we could potentially halve the injuries. A lot of people did get the warning and react. The alert reached about 270,000 people — those at the epicenter had just a few seconds of warning, but people in the Bay Area had up to 100 seconds. People were warned all the way to the south of the Bay Area, more than 400 kilometers from the earthquake.",,5,Earthquake_Tsunami_MajorEvents,news analysis,1,0,0,0.9338,[],['Of']

The tremor registered as a 5.4-magnitude earthquake, among the largest ever recorded in the state. Then, a month later, another of similar magnitude struck not far away, near Odessa and Midland, twin oil country cities with relatively tall office buildings, some of them visible for miles around.

The earthquakes, arriving in close succession, were the latest in what has been several years of surging seismic activity in Texas, a state known for many types of natural disasters but not typically, until now, for major earth movements. In 2022, the state recorded more than 220 earthquakes of 3.0 magnitude or higher, up from 26 recorded in 2017, when the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas began close monitoring.

So unheard of were strong earthquakes in the flat, oil-rich expanse about a six-hour drive west of Austin that some residents at first mistook the November quake for a powerful gust of wind.

The quake came as Japan is still grappling with the aftermath of the nuclear crisis at Fukushima.

Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from towns and farming villages around the plant after the 2011 quake, and some have not returned. The cleanup of the area around the Fukushima plant is still in an early phase, and last summer the government announced that it would start releasing treated radioactive wastewater into the ocean, alarming China and South Korea.

An official from Japan’s Nuclear Regulatory Agency said that after Monday’s quake, there were no signs of abnormalities at any radioactivity monitoring stations at the Shika nuclear power plant in Ishikawa, on Japan’s western coast.

The earthquake trapped people under collapsed buildings and also disrupted electricity for tens of thousands in Ishikawa Prefecture. Medical workers in the port city of Wajima were treating patients in a hospital parking lot, NHK reported.

Two strong earthquakes were among a series of tremors that shook Taiwan's eastern coast early Tuesday local time. No injuries or deaths had been reported by Tuesday morning.

The quakes damaged buildings in an area struck by a larger earthquake that killed 17 people earlier this month and were considered aftershocks of the earlier quake, authorities said.

National agencies often report different strengths for a quake. Taiwanese officials reported Tuesday’s largest quake as a magnitude 6.3, while the United States Geological Survey said its magnitude was 6.1.

262,2022-03-10,Citizen Seismologists Track Haiti’s Earthquakes,"Writing in an article published on Thursday in the journal Science, Dr. Calais and his colleagues described what the citizen science seismometers revealed about the August earthquake. About 40 miles of the same fault that caused the devastating 2010 earthquake ruptured, but farther to the west. The data also revealed some surprises, Dr. Calais said: At the eastern end of this segment, the fault was not vertical, where two tectonic plates are sliding past each other. Instead, the two plates were also being pushed together, with the northern one sliding on top of the southern one.

“If we hadn’t had the aftershock distribution, then we would not have been able to put in our models the proper full geometry,” Dr. Calais said. “Then our assessment of what went on would have been wrong.”

The Caribbean is sometimes a zone of overlooked seismic dangers with active volcanoes and earthquake faults. “The Caribbean is its own small-scale Ring of Fire,” said Susan E. Hough, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey. “It’s like the Pacific Rim on a smaller scale.”

But the tectonic plates are crashing together at a slower pace, and major earthquakes occur less often. The second half of the 20th century was pretty quiet in the region. “People got kind of complacent about it,” Dr. Hough said. “The 2010 earthquake didn’t surprise any earthquake professionals in the world, but it surprised a lot of people that weren’t aware of the scientific results.”

Dr. Hough and Dr. Calais were two of the earthquake experts who traveled to Haiti in 2010. In the aftermath of the quake that year, international organizations provided financing to set up conventional seismometers, which cost tens of thousands of dollars each, in Haiti. When the magnitude-7.2 earthquake hit on Aug. 14, none of Haiti’s conventional seismometers were working, although a seismometer at the United States embassy was gathering data.",,5,Earthquake_Tsunami_MajorEvents,scientific report,0,0,0,0.8594,"['United States', 'Haiti']",['Calais']

Even as sirens could be heard across New York, the Police Department, Fire Department and Con Edison said they had no immediate reports of damage. Mayor Eric Adams, who was attending a gun violence prevention meeting at Gracie Mansion, said he did not even feel the earthquake and was informed of it by his staff members. “New Yorkers should go about their normal day,” he said at a midday news conference.

But the earthquake also revealed apparent shortcomings in New York’s emergency notification system, coming after the Adams administration has been criticized for a delayed response to floods and wildfire smoke. On Friday, beeping text alerts warning residents to stay indoors were received a half-hour or more after the earthquake hit. (In earthquake-prone areas like California and Japan, a network of seismic sensors detect shaking, so alerts can arrive seconds before the quake.)

Zach Iscol, New York City’s commissioner of emergency management, defended the city’s alerts, saying officials had to confirm with the U.S.G.S. that the shaking was in fact caused by an earthquake.

Twenty-four people remained missing, as search efforts continued.

Officials had put the number of deaths from the shallow 5.6-magnitude quake, which rattled a mountainous area and caused damage across a wide area of disparate villages separated by rugged, hilly roads, at 272 as of Thursday afternoon. Some local officials had said earlier figures given by the central government were an undercount, in part because some families had buried their dead soon after the quake, before responders reached their villages. Officials said they were working on cross-checking the data by gathering death certificates or recording the identities of victims from the cemeteries of all affected villages.

The earthquake in Cianjur, an agricultural region in West Java Province famed for its rice, destroyed tens of thousands of homes and set off massive landslides that swallowed whole communities. About a third of those killed were children who had been trapped in houses or schools that crumbled, in a rural area with lax building standards, officials said in the days after the quake.

At least 162 people were dead after a powerful earthquake struck Java, Indonesia’s main island, yesterday. Hundreds more were injured. Officials expect the death toll to rise sharply — many people are trapped under damaged buildings or in landslides.

Damage from the 5.6-magnitude quake prevented many people from reaching the main hospital in ambulances. Instead, injured people reportedly arrived on motorbikes. Here’s a video of the damage.

The hospital itself was damaged and lost power. The government erected tents outside to treat injured people, and others were being treated in smaller hospitals nearby. “This is overwhelming,” a government official told reporters.

An earthquake struck a remote and mountainous part of Afghanistan yesterday, killing more than 1,000 people and injuring at least 1,600 others.

The quake, which had a magnitude of 5.9, struck about 28 miles southwest of the city of Khost, but the worst damage was in the neighboring Paktika province, which lies along the border with Pakistan and where some residents live in houses made of clay and straw. It was the deadliest earthquake to hit Afghanistan in more than two decades, and the number of casualties was expected to rise, a U.N. agency said.

Search-and-rescue efforts, led by the Afghan Ministry of Defense, were hampered by wind and heavy rain, which prevented helicopters from landing safely. A U.N. representative for Afghanistan reported that nearly 2,000 homes were destroyed. Afghan families are typically large, and families sometimes live together, the representative said, and the earthquake will most likely displace many people.

One such effect is a sense of dizziness after an especially large or frightening earthquake.

Others might report experiencing “phantom” earthquakes that might feel like subtle aftershocks, or like the room has started shaking again, but this is in fact purely psychological.

There is very little research into these phenomena, and most of it has been done in the wake of earthquakes far larger than the one that jolted the Northeast on Friday.

The convoy, which was originally scheduled to arrive on Monday to assist people affected by the country’s civil war, was the first significant delivery of aid to the territory since the earthquake occurred on Monday morning. The delivery had been stalled by road blockages caused by the earthquake, which has also impeded the work of those employed to verify and transport the aid materials.

The convoy entered Syria from Turkey, using the Bab al-Hawa crossing, which was not functioning after the earthquake and has been the only passage for U.N. aid to opposition-held areas in Syria for the past nine years during the war.

Some 258 million people in 58 countries who are facing armed violence, flooding or severe drought are now acutely short of food, including nearly 14 million children at imminent risk of death.

But despite extreme natural disasters this year, including earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, and Cyclone Freddy in Southern Africa, as well as wars in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, countries have failed to donate anywhere near the $57 billion target. Although donations always fall short of the total requested, funding for U.N. aid programs actually dropped in 2023 for the first time in 13 years — through the end of November, they had received a total of only $20 billion, $4 billion less than the previous year.

That leaves the United Nations with impossible choices. In Syria, where a 13-year conflict is grinding on, the organization’s food program has cut the number of recipients by 40 percent and halved the rations provided.

A strong, 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck in the Pacific Ocean near the Mexico-Guatemala border on Sunday, according to the United States Geological Survey.

The temblor happened at 7:39 a.m. Eastern about 11 miles southwest of Brisas Barra de Suchiate, Mexico and about 120 miles west of Guatemala City, data from the agency shows.

As seismologists review available data, they may revise the earthquake's reported magnitude. Additional information collected about the earthquake may also prompt U.S.G.S. scientists to update the shake-severity map.

Aftershocks in the region

An aftershock is usually a smaller earthquake that follows a larger one in the same general area. Aftershocks are typically minor adjustments along the portion of a fault that slipped at the time of the initial earthquake.

315,2021-08-14,The latest Haiti earthquake was more powerful than the devastating quake in 2010.,"“It’s well established that you do have this domino concept,” she said, where the energy released by one earthquake alters the stress patterns elsewhere along the fault line. “But we don’t have a crystal ball that tells us which domino is going to fall next.”

Dr. Hough said seismologists had been concerned about a region of the fault zone to the east, closer to the 2010 rupture site. “Now we’ve seen the segment to the west rupture,” she said.

She said that the fault ruptured both vertically and laterally. Preliminary analyses suggested that the fault ruptured to the west, which would mean that most of the energy was directed away from Port-au-Prince and toward the more sparsely populated region along the Tiburon peninsula. If that’s the case, then most of the aftershocks that inevitably follow a large earthquake would most likely occur to the west as well.

“To the extent that anything could be good news for Haiti, those are good signs,” Dr. Hough said.

At a magnitude of 7.2, Saturday’s quake released about twice as much energy as the one in 2010, which was a magnitude-7.0 quake. That quake killed some 300,000 people.

The five boroughs are home to more than 200,000 multifamily buildings made with un-reinforced brick and built from the mid-1800s to the 1930s, according to a city hazard plan. Many rowhouses across the city neighborhoods fall into this category.

Such masonry cannot bend or flex during an earthquake and would instead break or crumble. A strong earthquake could cause some buildings of this type to collapse.

321,2020-01-07,Why Are So Many Earthquakes Happening in Puerto Rico?,"The Geological Survey said that residents should be ready for more aftershocks in the coming days. The island is almost certain to have dozens more quakes of magnitude 3 or higher, and there is a 63 percent chance of an earthquake of magnitude of 5 or higher.

Why are there so many earthquakes in Puerto Rico right now?

At about three times the size of Rhode Island, Puerto Rico is squeezed between the border of the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates.

The Puerto Rico Trench, north of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, is an undersea fault zone. The North American plate is sliding under the Caribbean plate there, creating the potential for earthquakes and undersea landslides that can set off tsunamis.

“We’re just as likely to have earthquakes as a place like California, Japan, New Zealand, Alaska,” said Elizabeth Vanacore, a seismologist with the Puerto Rico Seismic Network.

When the tectonic plates in the region slide past each other and squeeze together, energy and stress build up until one side of a fault pops up, unleashing an earthquake. The earthquakes redistribute stresses along the fault for a time, until those stresses build up again and new tremors occur.",,5,Earthquake_Tsunami_MajorEvents,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.4576,"['United States', 'New Zealand', 'Japan', 'Puerto Rico']",[]
322,2024-04-06,Is New York City Overdue for a Major Earthquake?,"The earthquake that hit the Northeast on Friday morning rattled nerves but did not do much damage. Still, it left many New Yorkers wondering how afraid they should be of a bigger one hitting closer to the city.

The answer? It’s hard to say.

Some news reports suggest that a large earthquake is “due” in New York City because moderate ones — with a magnitude of 5 or more — typically occur every few hundred years. The last one took place in the 1700s. Friday’s earthquake, in comparison, was a magnitude 4.8.

In 2008, Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory found that the risk of earthquakes in the New York City area was greater than previously believed. That is because smaller earthquakes occur regularly in New York City, like a magnitude 1.7 earthquake that was recorded in Astoria, Queens, in January.

Experts caution that it is impossible to know when an earthquake will strike or how much damage it might cause. But if an earthquake much stronger than Friday’s were to hit closer to New York City, “it would be a different story,” said Kishor S. Jaiswal, a research structural engineer with the U.S. Geological Survey.

The U.S. Geological Survey estimated its magnitude at 6.8, but the Moroccan geological institute put it at 7.2. That would make it more than twice as large, according to the logarithmic scale on which earthquakes are measured. The U.S. agency said local estimates can often be more accurate, but initial readings of magnitude are measured automatically and need to be reviewed by seismologists.

The contours of the damage were also still taking shape on Saturday. But it was clear that the scope of the catastrophe was extensive, with the rural provinces outside of Marrakesh the hardest hit. According to early breakdowns of casualties by provinces, the death toll was especially heavy in the rural Haouz region southeast of Marrakesh, which includes parts of the High Atlas Mountains.

The United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement that more than 300,000 civilians in Marrakesh and its outskirts had been affected by the earthquake. “Many families are trapped under the rubble of their homes, and damage to parts of Marrakesh’s Medina, a UNESCO World Heritage Site have also been reported,” the statement said.

Moroccan architects say the area near the epicenter has many earthen houses that are not built to withstand an earthquake of this strength.

The damage in Marash is just a sliver of the wreckage seen across southern Turkey and northwestern Syria. The earthquake was one of the most powerful ever recorded in the region, about the same magnitude as a 1939 earthquake in Turkey that killed more than 30,000 people.

Whole blocks near the city’s center have been reduced to rubble. Cars line the roads, with people — whose homes were destroyed or who feel unsafe staying in damaged or vulnerable buildings — sleeping inside. The city’s soccer stadium has been turned into an aid distribution point, where displaced families shelter in tents. A nearby hospital once surrounded by buildings now stands alone.

The president of Turkey visited survivors at the stadium on Wednesday. He acknowledged that rescue efforts had been slowed by blocked roads and airport infrastructure issues and said more help was on the way.

For days, rescue teams and family members have been working through rubble of collapsed buildings throughout the city. Many survivors are angry that it has taken so long for heavy machinery to arrive as they search for loved ones trapped in the destruction.

333,2024-04-04,Why Taiwan Was So Prepared for a Powerful Earthquake,"When the largest earthquake in Taiwan in half a century struck off its east coast, the buildings in the closest city, Hualien, swayed and rocked. As more than 300 aftershocks rocked the island over the next 24 hours to Thursday morning, the buildings shook again and again.

But for the most part, they stood.

Even the two buildings that suffered the most damage remained largely intact, allowing residents to climb to safety out the windows of upper stories. One of them, the rounded, red brick Uranus Building, which leaned precariously after its first floors collapsed, was mostly drawing curious onlookers.

The building is a reminder of how much Taiwan has prepared for disasters like the magnitude-7.4 earthquake that jolted the island on Wednesday. Perhaps because of improvements in building codes, greater public awareness and highly trained search-and-rescue operations — and, likely, a dose of good luck — the casualty figures were relatively low. By Thursday, 10 people had died and more than 1,000 others were injured. Several dozen were missing.

“Similar level earthquakes in other societies have killed far more people,” said Daniel Aldrich, a director of the Global Resilience Institute at Northeastern University. Of Taiwan, he added: “And most of these deaths, it seems, have come from rock slides and boulders, rather than building collapses.”",,5,Earthquake_Tsunami_MajorEvents,natural disaster,4,0,1,-0.9555,"['China', 'Taiwan, Province of China']",[]

Many residents had been at home, getting ready for work and school, when the quake struck. Others were driving on highways or had already set off on early hikes in Taiwan’s national parks ahead of a four-day holiday. After the main quake stopped, people across the island fled on to the streets to assess damaged buildings and quickly text friends and family members reassurances and pictures of broken belongings.

But almost immediately, people felt the stomach-jolting lurch of an aftershock. Taiwan is earthquake-prone, and minor tremors are common, but these continued every few minutes throughout the day. By 3 p.m., there had been 101 subsequent shocks, with at least one tremor of magnitude 6.5 and many over magnitude 5.

The earthquake zones have much in common, with one long, major fault and scores of smaller, secondary ones. Using ground-based and satellite measurements, scientists are learning how the initial 7.8-magnitude quake in Turkey on Feb. 6 spawned aftershocks, including an unusually strong one on a secondary fault just hours after the first. That may help them better understand the potential strength and location of future quakes in California.

“There is no question that we’re going to learn an enormous amount” from the Turkish quakes, said Ross Stein, a seismologist formerly with the United States Geological Survey scientist and now a consultant.

In California’s recent history there have only been two quakes as powerful as the first Turkish one — the 7.9-magnitude San Francisco earthquake in 1906, and the Fort Tejon quake of 1857, which had a similar estimated magnitude and affected an area from the central part of the state southward to the east of Los Angeles.",,5,Earthquake_Tsunami_MajorEvents,scientific report,0,0,1,0.6808,"['United States', 'Türkiye', 'Syrian Arab Republic']","['Los Angeles', 'San Francisco']"

Even before the quake, living conditions had been unstable for many Haitians as the pandemic added to severe poverty, gang violence and political trauma — the still-unsolved July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.

The earthquake also destroyed several churches that have served as sources of aid and stability to surrounding communities, especially to those that receive little support from the government.

HAITI Jérémie Epicenter

Jérémie

Jérémie, the capital city of the Grand’Anse department in Haiti, also suffered severe damage. Just five years ago, Jérémie was hit by Hurricane Matthew, which destroyed a wave of development that had brought hotels, cell phone service and new roads to the previously isolated region. Saturday’s earthquake caused destruction that overwhelmed the city’s main hospital and triggered a landslide that cut off access to the road leading to the city.

356,2024-04-03,"Hualien County Is a Quiet, Scenic Tourist Destination","Hualien County on Taiwan’s east coast is a scenic, sleepy tourist area tucked away from the island’s urban centers, with a famous gorge and aquamarine waters. It also happens to sit on several active faults, making it prone to earthquakes.

The county has a population of about 300,000, according to the 2020 census, about a third of whom live in the coastal city of Hualien, the county seat. It is one of the most sparsely populated parts of Taiwan. About three hours by train from the capital, Taipei, the city describes itself as the first place on the island that’s touched by the sun.

Hualien County is home to Taroko National Park, one of Taiwan’s most popular scenic areas. Visitors come to explore the Taroko Gorge, a striated marble canyon carved by the Liwu River, which cuts through mountains that rise steeply from the coast. The city of Hualien is a popular destination as a gateway to the national park.

According to the state-owned Central News Agency, three hikers were trapped on a trail near the entrance to the gorge on Wednesday, after the quake sent rocks falling. Two of them were found dead, the news agency said. Administrators said many roads within the park had been cut off by the earthquake, potentially trapping hikers, according to the report.

Earthquakes have rattled Hualien with some regularity. In 2018, 17 people were killed and hundreds of others injured when a magnitude 6.5 quake struck just before midnight, its epicenter a short distance northeast of the city of Hualien.

Many of the victims in that quake were in a 12-story building that was severely tilted, the first four floors of which were largely crushed, according to news reports from the time. The next year, the area was shaken by a 6.1-magnitude earthquake that injured 17 people.

357,2023-02-06,"Hours after the first quake, the region was hit by an unusually large aftershock.","Like all large earthquakes, the powerful 7.8 magnitude temblor that struck Turkey and Syria on Monday was followed by dozens of aftershocks, secondary quakes that occur when the movement of the first causes changes in stresses underground.

One of those aftershocks, which struck about nine hours after the initial quake, was nearly as strong as the first and measured at magnitude 7.5. Powerful aftershocks like that can add to the destruction, shaking buildings and infrastructure that have already been badly weakened by the initial quake.

The 7.5 aftershock was well above average, and was about one-third as powerful as the 7.8 quake. From statistical analyses of quakes worldwide, the most powerful aftershock Monday would have been expected to be about magnitude 6.8, or only about one-thirtieth as powerful as the first quake.

“There’s nothing magic about aftershock magnitude,” said Susan Hough, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey. Sometimes an aftershock is even larger than the initial quake, Dr. Hough said, in which case the aftershock is considered the main quake and the first one is referred to as a foreshock.

Aftershocks can occur on the same fault as the main earthquake, or on nearby faults that are affected by the stress changes. This aftershock was centered about 60 miles north of the initial quake.

Aftershocks also can continue to occur for weeks or months following a strong quake, with their frequency and strength gradually declining.

The earthquakes on Monday occurred on the East Anatolian Fault Zone, part of a complex system of faults in Turkey that make the region one of the most seismically active in the world. Another fault zone, the North Anatolian, has caused many large earthquakes, including a 1999 quake centered about 60 miles from Istanbul that killed more than 15,000 people.

All of these are strike-slip faults, meaning the blocks of crust move horizontally relative to one another when strains between them reach a breaking point. Dr. Hough said that given the magnitude of the first quake on Monday, it’s likely that the movement occurred along 120 miles or so of the fault.

After the initial break, near Gaziantep in south central Turkey, the rupture would have propagated along the fault at about 2 miles a second, Dr. Hough said. This would help account for the lengthy shaking, which some witnesses said lasted for 90 seconds or longer.

Large strike-slip fault zones on land are not common , Dr. Hough said; the San Andreas Fault in California is another example. But those on land can be extremely destructive, because they tend to be close to population centers, and they can be fairly shallow, increasing the shaking felt at the surface.

Some quakes are centered more than a hundred miles below the surface, but the initial shock on Monday occurred at a depth of about 11 miles.

In some cases the destruction from strike-slip earthquakes is more widespread than from larger quakes that occur in so-called subduction zones, where one large crustal plate is sliding beneath another. Subduction zones, like those that exist around the rim of the Pacific Ocean, are usually offshore and tremors occur at greater depth. Most of the destruction in those cases often comes from a tsunami, as occurred in the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan.",,5,Earthquake_Tsunami_MajorEvents,scientific report,1,0,1,-0.9787,"['United States', 'Türkiye', 'Japan', 'Syrian Arab Republic']",['Gaziantep']

364,2023-03-14,Thousands of Buildings Collapsed in One Turkish City. Thousands More May Have to Come Down.,"The historical buildings’ lower height means damage is not always as clear in aerial imagery. But even among buildings still standing, deep cracks and profound structural damage mean many will need to be demolished.

In the old city, where centuries-old mosques, churches and a synagogue all stood within a few blocks of one another , there was also widespread destruction.

Across the river is the oldest part of Antakya, the heart of the ancient trading center founded in 300 B.C.

Shallow foundations and ground-floor retail, where more open floor plans weaken the structure, made buildings vulnerable as well. And experts agree that the shaking was powerful enough to severely damag e even strong buildings.

Many buildings had been damaged by previous smaller earthquakes and had not been properly reinforced since then.

Experts said there were many reasons — and not the same ones for every building — that thousands of buildings across the city collapsed while others standing just feet away remained intact, allowing residents to escape.

One residential complex, Guclu Bahce, o pened in 2019 with much fanfare and was marketed for its construction quality. Four of the complex’s five buildings collapsed. Two collapsed during the initial quakes on Feb. 6, and the other two fell during a smaller quake on Feb. 20, after this aerial imagery was captured.

A major effort to modernize and reform Turkey’s seismic code was undertaken in 1998, but many buildings in Antakya were built before the update.

“Many buildings might be standing, but there will be some that have heavy damage,” said Ayse Hortacsu, the director of projects for the Applied Technology Council who surveyed the earthquake damage in several cities.

Antakya experienced more severe ground motion than other cities, according to Bogazici University researchers. It was intense enough to damage even well constructed buildings.

Soft soil can amplify an earthquake’s effects, causing even greater damage. Many buildings between the July 15 Park and the river collapsed. Tents sheltering survivors now fill the park.

“All the soil near the river is sediment, the materials carried by the river over thousands of years,” said Mehmet Cemal Genes, an associate professor of engineering at Eastern Mediterranean University. “It is very soft.”

Experts think several factors made Antakya’s buildings more vulnerable, including poor building design and dense housing, as well as the city's proximity to a fault and position along the river.

Before the earthquake, multistory apartment buildings filled the more modern part of Antakya on the west side of the Asi River. Most were built in the 20th century, largely before modern earthquake codes were put in place.

About 3,100 buildings collapsed in Antakya, trapping residents and killing more than 20,000 people in the city, Lutfu Savas, the metropolitan mayor, said on Feb. 19.

Aerial imagery from the Turkish government shows astonishing destruction in Antakya near where a 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck on Feb. 6. The damage is so profound that officials estimate that 80 percent of the city’s remaining buildings will need to be demolished.

Mr. Genes, the engineering professor, said the destruction drove home the importance of listening to scientists. Ten years ago, Mr. Genes was part of a team that analyzed the potential damage to Antakya from an earthquake and found that many of the buildings it assessed were vulnerable to collapse.

“The politicians didn’t consider what the science is saying,” Mr. Genes said. “They always considered how they could get political support. For that reason, on very bad soil conditions, just for people to be able to earn huge money in a short period of time, they allowed them to construct 10-story buildings in Antakya, or more than 10. It could be possible, but you have to make huge investments in the foundation or soil improvement.”

After the earthquake, many of the buildings the group assessed as vulnerable did, in fact, collapse.

Haiti’s National Emergency Operations Center said that as of Tuesday evening the number of dead totaled at least 1,941, with 9,900 injured, compared with the official tallies of about 1,400 dead and 7,000 injured reported 24 hours earlier.

Finding help is not as easy as the man with the mobile phone might have thought. According to the figures released by the state, approximately 7,000 buildings in the area have been damaged or destroyed. The earthquake also hit Syria. Just as the true number of victims is probably much higher than is being reported (the most recent figures say the death toll is now more than 23,000), the actual number of collapsed buildings is also likely to be far greater. With roads closed and mobile phones not working properly because of power cuts and congested networks, there is little information at all on what is happening in the smaller provincial towns. On Twitter and on social media we see posts suggesting that some villages have been wholly destroyed. But is this true?

This is the largest earthquake to have struck Turkey in more than 80 years. It is the fourth major earthquake I have experienced, from near or far, since I was a child. After the 1999 Marmara earthquake, which killed more than 17,000 people, I had gone to Yalova, one of the towns ravaged by that disaster. I wandered for hours among the concrete ruins, filled with a sense of guilt and responsibility, and thinking I might at least help clear some of the rubble, only to return home without having been able to help anyone at all. The spectacular sight from that day stayed with me, along with the frustration and sadness that I want to forget but have never managed to.

Now these images are being crowded out by new and yet all too familiar ones. The sense of helplessness is crushing.

With airports damaged and roads impassable, it took even the media conglomerates hours to reach several big cities the earthquake has turned into hellscapes. Half a day after the disaster, they arrived in those snowy, rainy, windy streets to find themselves faced with millions of people angrily waiting for help. According to the numbers released by the Turkish state, 13.5 million people in the region have been affected by the earthquake.

381,2021-04-09,Your Reminder to Prepare for the ‘Big One’,"Here are the answers to some questions you may have:

Hold on — a big quake is more likely than it was previously?

Yes! As my colleague Henry Fountain disconcertingly reported last year, an analysis of changes along earthquake faults in Southern California suggested that the pair of big earthquakes that occurred near Ridgecrest over the July 4 weekend in 2019 (remember that?) changed the stresses along the nearby Garlock fault.

If there was a major quake on the Garlock fault, it could set off one on the San Andreas, which is much bigger. But that increased likelihood decreases over time.

So should I not worry about an earthquake?

Well, I don’t know about “worry.” But you should definitely prepare.

If you’re like me, you may be determined to quake-proof your life for approximately the first two hours after you are rattled by a temblor before other, more pressing, life matters present themselves.

But as experts have told me, that is not a great approach. As our friends at The Los Angeles Times who love frightening us helpfully put it in 2019, much of the state is a “tectonic time bomb.”",,5,Earthquake_Tsunami_MajorEvents,commentary,0,0,0,0.97,['United States'],['Ridgecrest']

Warming temperatures have caused the retreat of a glacier that helps support a steep, mile-long slope along one flank of a fjord in Prince William Sound, about 60 miles east of Anchorage. With only a third of the slope now supported by ice, the scientists said, a landslide could be triggered by an earthquake, prolonged heavy rain or even a heat wave that could cause extensive melting of surface snow.

A powerful earthquake that hit at 4:17 a.m. yesterday close to the border of Turkey and Syria has wrought devastation, killed more than 4,300 people and raised the specter of a new humanitarian disaster in an already troubled area of the world. Rescuers are searching for survivors in near-freezing temperatures and are facing what one expert called “a race against time and hypothermia.” Follow the latest updates.

The initial earthquake, centered near Gaziantep, was as strong as a quake that hit in 1939, the most powerful ever recorded in Turkey. A second major temblor, measuring 7.5 in magnitude, hit hours later. Earthquakes occur frequently in Turkey, which sits on fault lines, and recent quakes in the region have caused deadly landslides.

402,2023-08-24,Japan Begins Releasing Treated Radioactive Water at Fukushima,"Why It Matters

In the two years since Japan announced its plan to release the wastewater into the sea, the plan has provoked serious political tensions with nearby China and South Korea, as well as anxiety at home. The Chinese government had previously criticized the plan as unsafe; in South Korea, the administration of President Yoon Suk Yeol supports Japan’s efforts, but opposition lawmakers have castigated the move as a potential threat to humans. Within Japan, fishermen’s unions fear that public anxiety about the safety of the water could affect their livelihoods.

Background

Ever since a huge earthquake and tsunami in 2011 led to a meltdown at the Fukushima plant, Tepco, as the power company is known, has used water to cool the ruined nuclear fuel rods that remain too hot to remove. As the water passes through the reactors, it picks up nuclear materials. The power company runs the cooling water through treatment plants that remove most radioactive nuclides except for tritium, which the International Atomic Energy Agency said in July will not pose a serious health threat to humans if released to the ocean.

The Japanese government has said that with more than 1.34 million tons of wastewater already accumulated on site, the power company will shortly run out of storage room and that it has no choice but to release the water into the ocean.

What’s Next

The first release of 7,800 tons of treated water is expected to last about 17 days. Both Tepco and Japan’s fisheries agency have said they will monitor the ocean water for radioactive levels, and the IAEA has said it will also oversee the process, which is expected to last decades.

To compensate fishermen who lose business due to public anxiety, the Japanese government is allocating 80 billion yen ($552 million).

A tsunami advisory has been issued for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands after an earthquake in the Caribbean Sea, according to the U.S. Tsunami Warning System.

The potential tsunami was triggered by a 7.6-magnitude quake on Saturday evening Atlantic time, according to data from the system, which is part of the National Weather Service. Follow our coverage here.

Tsunamis are a series of long waves caused by a large and sudden displacement of water in the ocean, usually from a large earthquake on or below the ocean floor. Tsunamis radiate in all directions from the epicenter and can cause dangerous coastal flooding and powerful currents that can last for hours or days.

Experts warn that just before a tsunami hits shore, seawater can first be drawn out to sea — exposing large swaths of beach and giving people along the water a false sense that a coast is safe.

As more information becomes available, officials may update, add or cancel tsunami alerts.

Such insurance could cost up to $15,000 a year, according to a report by RAND Corporation, and the quotes are notoriously difficult to find, especially after a community has already faced a landslide.

Experts say the dearth in insurance is largely because the risk is so difficult to predict and the marketplace of people requesting the insurance is so small.

The lack of insurance access has led some communities at a higher risk for landslides to push back against hazard maps that could better protect them because they don’t want to lower the value of their homes or prevent development. People who’ve lost homes, cars or other property to landslides can suffer a total loss, and some can still be on the hook to pay back the mortgage for a house that no longer exists.

Ocean waves can generate signals, not unlike those of earthquakes, when two collide as they are moving in opposite directions collide (one as it is approaching the shore, the other, as it is moving away). That collision sends a signal to the ocean floor, generating seismic waves that can be detected by seismographs — the same instruments used for monitoring earthquakes.

In the 1980s, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration installed buoys that can determine wave height using an accelerometer, which measures how much a buoy moves up and down. But those records did not go back far enough. Understanding the effects of climate change requires several decades of information, including those preceding the 1970s, when the world began to heat up, Dr. Bromirski said.

The records showed a “significant increase in both the mean winter wave heights and the number of large, strong wave events,” he said, noting that extended lulls in strong winter wave activity have also largely disappeared.

While the study’s methodology is unique, it is not the first to explore the effect of climate change on the ocean’s waves. In 2014, Canadian researchers used sea level pressure to model future wave heights, finding that the frequency of extreme waves could double or triple in several coastal regions around the world. A 2019 study by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, found that the rising sea-surface temperatures were influencing global wind patterns, and making waves stronger. Another 2019 study showed that high emissions could create the conditions for bigger waves.

Some researchers who were not involved in the latest study said that while the connections between climate change and sea-level rise have been well established, Dr. Bromirski’s paper added to research showing that waves, too, can contribute to worsening flooding, erosion and damage along the coast.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,1,0.7579,[],"['Berkeley', 'Santa Cruz']"

The nuclear authority’s final report concluded that the treated water would “have a negligible radiological impact to people and the environment” once it is released.

Japan’s plan has provoked controversy both at home and abroad, as government officials in China and many residents in South Korea have protested the release as unsafe.

Rafael Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s director general, said that, should Japan proceed with its planned discharge, the IAEA would also open a station in Fukushima to continue reviewing the water’s safety “for decades to come.”",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,scientific report,0,0,0,0.7351,"['China', 'Korea, Republic of', 'Japan']",[]
425,2023-08-22,"Just Like That, Tons of Radioactive Waste Is Heading for the Ocean","But perhaps even more worrying, Japan is setting a precedent for other governments that might be even less transparent. This is dangerous, particularly in Asia, where more than 140 nuclear power reactors are already in operation and, led by growth in China and India, dozens more are either being built, are in the planning stages or have been proposed. If Japan, a globally respected cultural and economic force, can get away with dumping radioactive water, what’s to stop other countries?

There’s no denying that Japan and Tepco are in a bind over what to do with the byproducts of the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. Melted nuclear fuel debris inside the damaged reactors is being cooled by pumped-in water, which comes into contact with a toxic cocktail of radioactive substances known as radionuclides. To this is added approximately 100 tons of groundwater and rainwater, which leak into the reactor buildings each day and also become contaminated. All of the water is sent through a powerful filtration system to remove much of the radioactivity and is stored on-site in more than 1,000 giant steel tanks. But the amount of water is constantly growing, and Tepco has repeatedly warned that it is running out of storage space at Fukushima.

I have researched or written about Fukushima and affected communities ever since the disaster and have closely followed the official response. As early as 2013, the I.A.E.A. began advising Tepco to consider discharging the water into the sea. The government also looked at other options, such as releasing the water into the air as vapor or injecting it deep underground. But numerous experts and environmental groups have complained that there has been a consistent lack of sufficient public input and that some viable alternatives, such as long-term storage in more robust tanks, were not seriously evaluated. Despite opposition from many Japanese citizens, the country’s fisheries association, and neighbors like South Korea and China, the government announced in April 2021 that it had decided on releasing the water into the ocean.

Public hearings, some of which I attended, were held before and after the final decision, but these seemed more about selling the ocean release option than about giving the public a say. It was only months after the decision was announced that a radiological environmental impact assessment — conducted by Tepco — was finally released. When Tepco called for public comments for the study, some experts pointed out troubling information gaps, such as the lack of a full inventory of what radioactive elements remained in the tanks. There is no evidence that serious efforts were made to address some of these issues.

Involving local residents, civil society groups, technical experts and — when necessary — neighboring nations in decision-making can lead to notable successes. In choosing the site of a long-term repository for low-level radioactive waste, Belgian regulators in 1998 gave decision-making power to a broad cross section of public and private stakeholders. In the end, two neighboring towns actually competed to be the site, and in 2006 a proposal by the municipality of Dessel was approved. After years of study and environmental approvals, a final permit was issued this year.

California is home to the tallest dam in America, located 60 miles north of Sacramento in Oroville. A failure of that dam would be catastrophic; in one particularly alarming scenario, it would send a wave more than 185 feet tall sweeping into the valley below, inundating several towns. When the St. Francis Dam in northern Los Angeles County failed in 1928, the disaster was one of the deadliest in state history.

Areas to the north and northeast were still at risk of heavy rain and flooding from the storm, which weakened to a post-tropical cyclone with winds that were expected to dissipate further as the day wore on.

In Los Angeles and San Diego, officials said their cities had emerged without any known storm deaths, and that the damage was minor.

“Los Angeles was tested, but we came through it, and we came through it with minimal impacts,” said the president of the Los Angeles City Council, Paul Krekorian.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,2,0,1,-0.7469,[],"['San Diego', 'Los Angeles']"
449,2023-01-18,How the Gas-Stove Debate Has Played Out in California,"You may have heard chatter recently about gas stoves: whether they’re bad for your health, or the planet’s, and whether they’re soon going to be banned in your city or state.

Last week, a suggestion that gas stoves may one day be regulated by the federal government started a rumpus in Washington. There’s growing recognition that gas stoves release hazardous chemicals into homes, contribute to global warming and produce emissions that may be linked to rates of childhood asthma.

Bans on gas appliances are unlikely to advance in Washington anytime soon because of fierce opposition from the gas industry and its political allies. But what about in California?

For the past few years, our state has been on the leading edge of gas-stove bans.

Republicans tend to be the loudest defenders of natural gas, but gas-powered stoves tend to be most common largely in Democratic-controlled states, my colleagues Elena Shao and Lisa Friedman report. In fact, the state with the highest percentage of households using natural gas for cooking (70 percent) is California, according to a 2020 analysis from the Energy Information Administration.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,0.7717,[],['Washington']
450,2021-07-03,"After another day without finding survivors, the rescue work enters a delicate phase.","Following another painstaking, dangerous and ultimately fruitless day in the search for survivors, the rescue effort at the site of the Champlain Towers South collapse appeared to be entering a delicate new phase, as officials and rescuers continued to quietly acknowledge the possibility that no more victims would be found alive, though they refused to abandon all hope.

No survivors have been found since the day of the disaster in Surfside, Fla., more than a week ago, and although federal, state and local officials said they remained committed to the rescue effort, there was no sign of letup in the extraordinary challenges at the site of the condominium collapse.

Rescue workers have found it extremely difficult to tunnel through the layers of flattened concrete without putting people in danger, amid rubble that is so unstable that work was suspended for at least 12 hours on Thursday because of fears that it could collapse further. And the thunderstorms that have plagued the mission could soon worsen with the approach of Hurricane Elsa, which hammered the eastern Caribbean on Friday and could affect parts of Florida early next week, forecasters said.

Officials said on Saturday that the uncollapsed portion of the building was too unsound to withstand a tropical storm, and that they were accelerating plans to demolish it before the storm arrives.

451,2024-12-26,20 Years Since the Deadly Tsunami in Asia,"The wave surged and rushed. It sent water as high as 160 feet slamming onto land with a force far outstripping that of an atomic bomb. When the tsunami inundated the coasts of more than a dozen Indian Ocean nations on Dec. 26, 2004, about 230,000 people lost their lives. Entire communities were erased. It was the deadliest tsunami in recorded history.

No one was immune to the giant wave, which was triggered by a 9.1 magnitude earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Among the dead were fishermen, vacationers, sports stars and a prince.

The brunt of the tsunami was felt in the Indonesian province of Aceh, where 170,000 people perished. Sri Lanka, India and Thailand were devastated, too. More than a thousand miles apart, across the Indian Ocean, hundreds of coastal communities were united in their grief, and in facing years of rebuilding and regrouping.

In New Jersey, a tornado warning was issued for Tinton Falls, Eatontown and Red Bank, according to the National Weather Service. The weather service also warned of strong thunderstorms with 50 mile-per-hour winds and half-inch sized hail in northern Westchester, eastern Putnam and Rockland Counties.

Waves of severe storms will continue to sweep across the eastern United States early this week.

As is typical for this time of year, colder, drier air will forcefully clash with warmer moist air, creating the perfect conditions for storms to form across the Midwest and the Southeast. Over the weekend, hundreds of thousands of people lost power as ice storms swept across the upper Midwest and Canada, while damaging winds knocked down trees across the central United States and the Southeast.","Severe thunderstorms threatened northeastern New Jersey, New York City, the lower Hudson Valley.

455,2025-03-17,DOGE Is Making It Harder to Track Extreme Weather. What Could Go Wrong?,"The agency’s scientists help build the forecasting models used to predict what the weather will look like next week, and what your children’s climate might look like half a century from now. Farmers use the agency’s weather data to plan their crop planting and harvesting, and urban firefighters rely on it to anticipate high wind events and prepare for downed power lines and evacuations. But staffing reductions at NOAA’s National Weather Service offices have suspended the launch of weather balloons that collect wind, temperature and humidity readings from Alaska to Albany.

These cuts threaten your budget, too. Insurance companies rely heavily on data gathered by NOAA and the U.S. Geological Survey to assess wildfire, flood, wind and other risks. Some firms are warning that any interruption in data availability could drive insurance premiums for customers even higher. Other layoffs at the U.S.G.S. could undermine programs that monitor drought and flood conditions, hazardous spills and sewage overflows and the health of salmon fisheries off the Pacific Coast.

And then there’s air pollution. On March 4, the State Department announced that it would no longer share data gathered by air quality monitors at more than 80 U.S. embassies and consulates around the world. With that decision, another one of the government’s most effective global monitoring efforts went dark.

Since the first air quality monitoring system was installed atop the U.S. Embassy in Beijing in 2008, the initiative has yielded a huge return on a modest investment by simply telling people what they’re breathing. During a particularly severe air pollution episode in November 2010, the Beijing monitor tweeted an automated message that air quality in the city had reached “crazy bad” levels. The programmers had written that message in jest, assuming that it would never be triggered because pollution levels would never get that bad. The tweet prompted news stories around the world, and the intense scrutiny helped compel China’s leaders to act. Fifteen years later, China’s air is much cleaner.

From Lagos to Karachi, U.S. Embassy monitors were among the only reliable sources of information about what residents were inhaling every day. One 2022 study found that the air quality readings triggered local policies that substantially reduced particulate matter concentrations, leading to reductions in premature deaths and saving an average of $127 million per city each year. The State Department cited “budget constraints” as the reason for shuttering the program. But the researchers found that the program saved the State Department money — it more than covered its costs by reducing compensation for embassy workers’ pollution exposure.","NOAA’s National Weather Service offices have suspended the launch of weather balloons that collect wind, temperature and humidity readings.

By Thursday morning, the heaviest rains had shifted out of Los Angeles County and into Orange County, though showers and isolated thunderstorms were expected to linger through Thursday afternoon. Rose Schoenfeld, a meteorologist at the Los Angeles office of the Weather Service, warned that the risk of flash flooding and debris flows would persist.

“The thunderstorms could produce flash flooding impacts, gusty winds and small hail,” Ms. Schoenfeld said. “But overall, the main part of the storm has exited L.A. County.”

Thousands of people in Los Angeles County were driven from their homes by wildfires two months ago. This week’s storm system was the second in a month to set off a cascade of intense preparation as traumatized fire survivors and state and local authorities rushed to prevent the fire-stripped soil from turning into a slurry of muck and debris and sliding out from under remaining homes, roads and buildings. A similar storm in mid-February generated several minor debris flows and at least a dozen close calls, including that of a Los Angeles fire inspector whose vehicle was swept off the road and into the Pacific Ocean by a mudslide near Malibu.

County, urban search and rescue teams and swiftwater rescue teams worked to support 12 flood related incidents. One incident included a LAFD member who was swept off the road and into the ocean near Malibu., but the proactive response prevented significant damage or injuries.","The Weather Service issued multiple flash flood warnings throughout the night and into Thursday morning.

Alfred was expected to come ashore Saturday morning near Brisbane, the capital of Queensland state and home to about 2.7 million people. As of Friday afternoon, it was hovering about 80 miles off the coast of the city and already causing flooding with abnormally high tides.

To the south, in the neighboring state of New South Wales, local officials said about 29,000 dwellings were considered at risk of flooding as of Friday afternoon, with about 15,000 people in the state under evacuation orders. The authorities counted about 38,000 in the state without power and 46,000 in Queensland.

Officials warned that the storm’s slow churn westward, moving about 5 miles per hour on Friday, could amplify its impact on coastal communities by prolonging the rainfall and storm surges. Among the areas threatened by the storm is Lismore, a small city about eight hours north of Sydney which suffered devastating floods in 2022 in which 22 people died.","Tropical Cyclone Alfred is expected to make landfall Saturday morning near Brisbane, Queensland.

The Southern California areas scorched by flames last month had been of particular concern because the soil in those areas can repel water and allow sheets of mud to race downhill and collect debris along the way.

As the brunt of the storms arrived on Thursday afternoon, the National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings in Malibu and Pacific Palisades, two communities that suffered heavy damage during the Palisades fire last month. Shortly thereafter, the Weather Service issued the same warning in the Altadena area, where thousands of structures were destroyed by the Eaton fire, and across much of Los Angeles County, affecting about seven million people.

Streets had flooded in some areas, and mudslides forced the closure of Pacific Coast Highway and Mulholland Drive.

Santa Barbara County issued an evacuation warning for people around an area that was burned by the Lake fire last year.

Urban flooding is likely, especially in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties, but Ryan Kittell, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said it was not expected to be as severe as it was in 2023 when, after storms, the streets of downtown Santa Barbara turned into rivers.

“The totals don’t look as high for Santa Barbara as those storms, and the rainfall leading up to those storms is much less for this storm,” Mr. Kittell said. “But with that in mind, we do anticipate lots of road issues in Santa Barbara.”

While the rainfall totals will add up across 48 hours, the short, sharp bursts of rain are the main threat.

After a brief lull of largely dry conditions from Wednesday afternoon, the storm is expected to arrive in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties through the early hours of Thursday morning and then head to Ventura and Los Angeles Counties by late morning.

However, behind the storm a cold front will sweep in, bringing intense rainfall that could set off life-threatening debris flows around recent burn areas, particularly in the areas of the Eaton, Palisades, Franklin and Bridge fires, said Andrew Rorke, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Los Angeles.

“This will be the worrisome portion of the storm, as rainfall rates near one inch per hour will be possible,” Mr. Rorke said.

472,2025-01-31,Heavy Rain and Floods Sweep Hawaii’s Big Island and Maui,"Torrential rains unleashed flooding and high winds and generated warnings of landslides to Hawaii and Maui, the two largest Hawaiian islands, on Friday, all part of a storm system that has been sweeping through the chain of islands this week.

On the island of Hawaii, known as the Big Island because it’s the largest in the archipelago, rain drenched the North Kona district from Keauhou to Kailua-Kona, the second largest community on the island and a center of tourism and commerce with a population of about 20,000 people. Up to three inches of rain was expected to fall along the island’s west side by the end of the day, the National Weather Service said.

Flash flood warnings went into effect as streams rose rapidly, forecasters said.

Thunderstorms and high winds reached the Big Island on Friday but were expected to weaken before Saturday. The storm had migrated southeast over several days along the chain of islands, from Kauai to Oahu and then reaching Maui, the second largest island, on Thursday, when heavy rainfall led to floods that inundated communities.

Maureen Ballard, a Weather Service meteorologist in Honolulu, said that the storm system had been weakening, bringing fewer thunderstorms, as it moved south and down the chain.",Torrential rains unleashed flooding and high winds and generated warnings of landslides.

473,2025-02-05,Why California’s Wettest Storms Can Be Its Trickiest,"Last week, as forecasters at the National Weather Service in the San Francisco Bay Area looked at a series of storms that would hammer the region, they predicted that some areas in the North Bay would see six to eight inches of rain between Saturday and Tuesday.

Instead, around a foot of rain fell at the wettest locations. Highways were flooded, landslides were triggered, and rivers swelled. By Tuesday afternoon, a house slid down a saturated hillside and fell into the Russian River in Sonoma County. Evening evacuation orders were issued, hours before the swollen river started spilling over onto a handful of roadways.

The storms, known as atmospheric rivers, are a common feature of West Coast winters. They’re thin ribbons of moisture carried by powerful winds, sometimes for thousands of miles, which can make forecasting them especially challenging.

“We got a little more rain than expected, and the rivers responded more than expected as well,” said Dylan Flynn, a meteorologist with the Weather Service. “A couple days ago we didn’t expect any of the rivers to flood.”",A foot of rain fell in a few hours in the San Francisco Bay Area.

474,2025-02-04,What to Expect From the Rain in California,"Since last Friday, some reporting stations, like Brush Creek Ranger Station in the mountains just northeast of Lake Oroville, have measured over a foot of rainfall, with more on the way. An additional three to six inches of rain is possible across the Sierra Nevada foothills, and another two to four inches of rain is possible over the coastal ranges.

The heaviest rain on Tuesday may come later in the day, possibly even as rare thunderstorms during the afternoon bring lightning, stronger winds and heavier rain through the Bay Area. A water spout or two may form as the stronger storms push ashore.

Rivers across Northern California were swollen on Tuesday from the heavy rainfall. In Mendocino County, the Garcia River spilled over its banks, closing a portion of Highway 1 north of Point Arena. Just north of San Francisco in Sonoma County, the Russian River at Guerneville is predicted to reach minor flood stage by early Wednesday morning.

Once the strongest storms move through, there will be a brief reprieve on Wednesday. But it won’t last long. The third atmospheric river in this series approaches Wednesday night into Thursday.

That next system “looks a good deal weaker than the current atmospheric river, with less rain and lighter winds,” forecasters with the National Weather Service in San Francisco said. Most areas will receive a more manageable amount of rain, probably less than an inch, before things dry out on Friday.","Since last Friday, some reporting stations have measured over a foot of rainfall.

Isolated thunderstorms, flooding rains and damaging winds are all possible in an area between East Texas and western Kentucky.

The system was on track to deliver snow across part of the Southwest overnight Tuesday and move across the Southern Rockies by Wednesday morning, “doing all of this very slowly,” said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center.

476,2025-02-03,That Giant Sucking Sound? It’s Climate Change Devouring Your Home’s Value.,"The implications are staggering: Many Americans could face a paradigm shift in the way they save and how they define their economic security. Climate change is upending the basic assumption that Americans can continue to build wealth and financial security by owning their own homes. In a sense, it is upending the American dream.

Homeownership is the bedrock of America’s economy. Residential real estate in the United States is worth nearly $50 trillion — nearly double the size of the entire gross domestic product. Almost two-thirds of American adults are homeowners, and the median house here has appreciated more than 58 percent over the past two decades, even after accounting for inflation. In Pacific Palisades and Altadena, that evolution elevated many residents into the upper middle class. Across the country homes are the largest asset for most families — who hold approximately 67 percent of their savings in their primary residence.

That is an awful lot to lose: for individuals, and for the nation’s economy.

The First Street researchers found that climate pressures are the main factor driving up insurance costs. Average premiums have risen 31 percent across the country since 2019, and are steeper in high-risk climate zones. Over the next 30 years, if insurance prices are unhindered, they will, on average, leap another 29 percent, according to First Street. Rates in Miami could quadruple.

“It’s a steady stream of moisture that’s being channeled from the Pacific Ocean into California and as it moves inland, it’s fueling periods of moderate to heavy precipitation,” said Frank Pereira, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center.

Forecasters had originally said two separate atmospheric rivers would hit the West Coast, but by Saturday, it was difficult to tell one from the other.

“I think more important than identifying a second storm is really the continuous atmospheric river conditions,” said Julie Kalansky, deputy director at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.

The Pacific Northwest is also picking up some precipitation and off-and-on rain and snow. Showery weather is forecast for the region through the weekend and into the week but Northern California is in the bull’s-eye for the wet weather.

479,2025-01-26,Los Angeles Faces Risk of Mudslides With the Arrival of Rain,"The Santa Ana winds that have fueled wildfires for weeks in Southern California finally stopped blowing on Friday, and an unusually long period of dry weather was on track to end in Los Angeles County as a cold storm arrived late Saturday.

The system was expected to deliver light to moderate rain that will fall intermittently through Monday. The weather will give the arid landscape and withered vegetation a much-needed soaking and benefit firefighting crews.

Still, the forecast showed a small risk that bursts of heavy rain could cause flash floods and mudslides around areas of Los Angeles County recently scarred by wildfires, including the northwest (Hughes fire), east (Bridge fire), southwest (Franklin and Palisades fires) and especially the central area where the Eaton fire burned.

The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for those areas from 10 a.m. Sunday to 4 p.m. Monday, when there is the highest chance for rain and risk for thunderstorms.

Kristan Lund, a meteorologist with the Weather Service, called flooding the worst-case scenario for the conditions in Los Angeles, where there is up to a 20 percent chance that debris flows could damage roads and structures.

“What we’re telling people is to avoid the area during the watch period,” Ms. Lund said. “Use sandbags to protect your property, and if residents decide to stay, make sure to stock up on supplies in case road access is blocked.”

The Los Angeles area has seen its driest start to the rainy season on record and has not measured significant rainfall since last spring. Since May 1, the Weather Service’s gauge in downtown Los Angeles has measured just a little more than a quarter-inch of rain. This weekend’s expected storm has the potential to bring nearly four times that amount.

The burn scars in Los Angeles County, where trees and brush were devoured by flames, are most likely to benefit from the rain. “If we get gentle rains, it’s going to help make those burn areas recover and re-vegetate,” said Jayme Laber, a hydrologist with the Weather Service.

The first drops of rain began to fall Saturday night, with showers expected to increase Sunday into Monday. Most locations across the county, including downtown Los Angeles, are expected to record up to an inch of rain in the storm.

But isolated showers and thunderstorms could bring rain that falls at three quarters of an inch an hour, and the heavier rains could lead to debris flows Sunday afternoon through Monday afternoon. The thunderstorms could also kick up strong, damaging winds, drop small hail and cause water spouts over the ocean, the Weather Service said.

The weather is expected to temporarily lower the risk of wildfires, but this one storm won’t fully end it.

“It’s only going to help things out for a couple weeks,” Matt Shameson, a meteorologist with the U.S. Forest Service, said of the storm. “If we get another one or two decent systems, that will help us out significantly.”

The good news is that another set of showers could come over the region sometime next week, Mr. Shameson said.","Storm expected to deliver light to moderate rain that will fall intermittently through Monday.

Vehicles that were swallowed by rapidly rising rivers on Sept. 27 remain abandoned in the water.

Roughly a dozen members of the California Watershed Emergency Response Teams and the United States Forest Service are studying the edges of the Eaton and Palisades fires to determine what patches of land burned most severely. Soon, they’ll issue hazard maps to help people prepare for what comes next: the near-certain threat of floods and landslides that will loom for days, months and even years while the city recovers.

“After a wildfire, the hazard to the public is not over,” said Jeremy Lancaster, California’s state geologist. He and his team spent Wednesday hiking in the steep canyons that flank the San Gabriel and Santa Monica Mountains. When it rains hard enough, the sediment on slopes like these can swiftly tumble downhill onto houses that increasingly push up against the fire-prone foothills.

The two major hazards after a wildfire are flash flooding and post-fire debris flows.

The Floods This Time: In the Mediterranean, Climate Change Is Already Here

Short, heavy rainfall is typical of the Mediterranean, but like many of the climate extremes in recent years, including the current fires in Los Angeles, nothing is typical about what has been happening there recently.

In the autumn, deadly floods wreaked havoc along an arc from Spain to the Balkans, and from Morocco to Libya. More than 200 people were killed in Valencia in October, not long after a deluge dumped five times the month’s ordinary rainfall across Europe in a single week.

Scientists say climate change is increasing not just the strength of the Mediterranean’s devastating storms but also the frequency — and they predict that it will get only worse.

Sources: Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change and the International Disaster Database Note: The map shows daily accumulated precipitation for the 99th percentile (top 1 percent) of recorded wet days for the time period.

The intensity of these extreme precipitation events is likely to increase in the coming decades, said Leone Cavicchia, a scientist at the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change.

That is partly because the Mediterranean region is already warming 20 percent faster than the global average. And as the temperature of the air rises, so does its capacity to hold water.

Climate models suggest that even as heavy rainfall events in the Mediterranean region intensify, average rainfall will decrease. In other words, dry areas will be drier, but when extreme rains come, they will be more intense.

A geography tailor-made for flash floods

The mountains, closed sea and dry riverbeds around the Mediterranean Sea make the area particularly at risk of flash flooding.

Most waterways in the region are fairly dry for long periods of the year. When heavy rains come, the water quickly concentrates in steep river beds, and can rise several meters in just a few hours, said Francesco Dottori, an associate professor of hydrology at the University School for Advanced Studies in Pavia, Italy.

The mountains that ring much of the Mediterranean Sea can play a role in triggering intense rainfall when they block warm, moist masses of air. As the air rises, it cools and the moisture condenses, creating clouds and rain. Cold air at high altitude Heavy rain Torrents Warm, moist air Warm sea Cold air at high altitude The mountains that ring much of the Mediterranean Sea can play a role in triggering intense rainfall when they block warm, moist masses of air. As the air rises, it cools and the moisture condenses, creating clouds and rain. Heavy rain Torrents Warm, moist air Warm sea

The Mediterranean Sea is warming faster than other bodies of water in part because it is a practically closed sea. That makes it a potent source of moisture that the winds can carry inland, feeding rainfall systems, often over the coastal areas in which much of the Mediterranean population is concentrated.

The strong atmospheric currents of the polar jet stream also play a role in the region's weather. As the currents oscillate, they make north-south waves whose crests send warm air to the north and whose troughs send cold air to the south.

Sometimes, when part of the jet stream breaks away, it forms a low-pressure system known as a cut-off low. That can linger for days, causing instability when it meets the warmer Mediterranean air.

Polar jet stream Dip Cut-off low Polar jet stream Dip Cut-off low

That is what happened in September, when Storm Boris originated as one such low pressure system and went on to cause devastation in Central and Southern Europe, where it killed at least 24 people. It was another cut-off low that caused the flooding soon after in Valencia, where hundreds died. And last year, a cut-off low over Greece unleashed Storm Daniel, which strengthened as it crossed the Mediterranean into Libya, killing 13,200 after two dams burst.

Over recent decades, most coastal and floodplain areas in the Mediterranean region have also become densely urbanized, leaving little space for waterways. Those changes don’t just amplify the risk of flooding — they also put more people in harm’s way.

Floods have become generally less deadly thanks to the improvements in flood protection structures and early warning systems. But more homes and properties are being hit because of urban development and population growth, said Mr. Dottori, who helped develop the European Flood Awareness System.

The population of Mediterranean countries has more than doubled since the 1960s.

484,2025-01-16,We Have to Stop Underwriting People Who Move to Climate Danger Zones,"In theory, insurance prices quantify the risks of living in a certain place. Of course it should be more expensive to insure a home in an area buffeted by disaster. But in practice, states vary widely in their willingness to allow insurance premiums to increase, with some making it far harder than others for insurers to raise prices. California is one of the most resistant, and until recently refused to let insurers raise premiums or reflect climate-catastrophe risks in their pricing.

Insurers doing business in such heavily regulated states, finding themselves unable to raise premiums when needed, wind up shifting some of the costs to homeowners who happen to live in states that are more accommodating to premium increases. That is, in part, how middle-class communities, such as Enid, Okla., can end up subsidizing the owners of million-dollar houses in Malibu. And under our current regulatory regime, that dynamic is only expected to strengthen as climate losses continue to cut into insurance companies’ bottom line.

The voices loudly criticizing California for its rigid control of insurance pricing are ignoring numerous similar examples from the rest of the country. In 2023, after the federal flood insurance program began to adjust its premiums to better reflect climate realities, 10 states across the political spectrum — including reliably red Louisiana, Florida and Texas and moderate blue Virginia — sued the program. And California isn’t the only state that failed to raise premiums to properly fund its FAIR plan, the state-sponsored insurer of last resort often relied on by those living in climate-vulnerable areas; Florida did as well.

Home insurance is just one way our financial system encourages Americans to move to flood-prone sections of Florida or parched, air-conditioning-dependent Arizona. The government mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which guarantee about 70 percent of mortgages on single-family homes, charge the same fees regardless of climate risk. Nobody intends to move into harm’s way. Many people settle in places like Texas because housing is generally more affordable. But that affordability is a mirage: Their mortgage and insurance risks are being subsidized by everyone else. This system, and the continual building in risky areas, portends ever-rising disaster losses.

We get why change is hard. Losing one’s home can be economically and emotionally devastating. Rising insurance premiums can stress homeowners who are already struggling. For households that have their entire life savings tied to their homes, hefty premiums combined with lower home values tied to the cost of insurance could even lead them to default on their mortgages.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,0,-0.98,[],"['Of', 'Virginia', 'Texas', 'Enid', 'Florida']"

As Los Angeles burned for days on end, horrifying the nation, scientists made an announcement on Friday that could help explain the deadly conflagration: 2024 was the hottest year in recorded history.

With temperatures rising around the globe and the oceans unusually warm, scientists are warning that the world has entered a dangerous new era of chaotic floods, storms and fires made worse by human-caused climate change.

The firestorms ravaging the country’s second-largest city are just the latest spasm of extreme weather that is growing more furious as well as more unpredictable.

486,2025-01-04,Is America Just Going to Abandon Its Towns Falling Into the Ocean?,"In the 1930s, a terrible drought plunged farming communities across the United States into catastrophe. As millions of Americans abandoned their homes, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created something remarkable: the Resettlement Administration, which sought to move entire communities to newly built towns such as Greendale, Wis., and Greenhills, Ohio.

Almost a century after the Dust Bowl, America is on the cusp of another displacement crisis, this one caused primarily by climate change. At the end of 2022, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center, an international nonprofit, counted 543,000 Americans who fled their homes to escape a disaster and had not yet returned. As the country’s 20th-century infrastructure becomes increasingly incompatible with the 21st-century climate, this number will grow. When it does, the fates of entire regions, and particularly coastal areas, will fracture along economic fault lines.

With the Resettlement Administration long gone, no federal agency bears responsibility for helping the most threatened and remote communities relocate if they wish to do so. Policymakers have essentially abandoned those Americans who need to move to safety in the wake of losing their land to rising seas and worsening storms.

This failure is especially striking because since the middle of the 20th century, the United States has almost always offered some form of compensation (however paltry) when its citizens’ land is taken. But most rural communities on the front lines of climate change are not granted the same consideration. While climate change is not eminent domain, the distinction hardly matters from the perspective of a displaced community.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,1,0,-0.9064,['United States'],['Roosevelt']
487,2024-12-28,Why Coffee Prices Are Soaring (Again),"When it comes to coffee, Thaleon Tremain has always tried to ignore what the market is telling him.

As the chief executive and a co-founder of Pachamama Coffee in California, Mr. Tremain sells his specialty beans for more than what the global commodity price might dictate. He wants his customers to think of coffee as a luxury product and pay for it accordingly, so that farmers who grow his beans in countries like Peru, Nicaragua and Ethiopia can cover their costs.

But now, Mr. Tremain is worried that coffee is getting more expensive for the wrong reasons. In recent years, repeated droughts and flooding have strained the global supply of coffee, frequently causing prices to soar, as climate change has done for other staples, like cocoa, olive oil and orange juice. At the same time, global demand for coffee has kept rising, with few signs that java drinkers are cutting back. This month, prices in one market broke a nearly 50-year high.

Even though prices might fall, Mr. Tremain said the volatility threatened the sustainability of businesses like his — and the livelihoods of the farmers who grow his beans. Lattes will probably also eventually get more expensive.

“Over time, we’re going to see much higher prices,” Mr. Tremain said in an interview. “Supply is not meeting demand.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,-0.9194,"['Ethiopia', 'Nicaragua', 'Peru']",['Lattes']
488,2024-12-21,Atmospheric Rivers Will Drench the West Coast,"The Pacific Northwest and Northern California, especially Washington and Oregon, have had an onslaught of storms and the run of them is expected to continue over the next week.

These systems, known as atmospheric rivers, are predicted to be quick-hitting and weak to moderate in severity and unlikely to cause extreme weather on an individual basis.

Together, though, they will have an impact, heightening the risk of holiday travel disruptions.

“Because they’re piled up over time, we’re looking at a significant amount of rainfall over the next week,” Frank Pereira, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center, said. “River flooding will become a growing concern as these systems continue to impact the area.”

The bulk of the rain and snow is likely to fall between British Columbia and Northern California, with Washington and Oregon poised to have some of the wettest, sloppiest weather.

Several storms, including one that swept into the Pacific Northwest on Tuesday night, are stacked up in the forecast, said Marty Ralph, the director of the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the University of California, San Diego.

“These storms are back-to-back-to-back-to-back,” said Mr. Ralph, who leads a team that studies atmospheric rivers. “This is a situation that can saturate the landscape, and then if one of the later atmospheric rivers turns out to be big and stalls, that’s where you can end up with a flood risk — substantial.”",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.0258,[],"['San Diego', 'Washington', 'Oregon']"
490,2024-12-15,My 500-Mile Journey Across Alaska’s Thawing Arctic,"Flames were leaping out of the forest beneath the float plane taking us deep into the remote interior of northern Alaska. Our destination was the glacial Walker Lake, which stretches 14 miles through Gates of the Arctic National Park.

Nearly 100 miles from the nearest dirt road, Walker Lake is within an expanse of uninhabited tundra, scraggly boreal forests and the seemingly endless peaks of the Brooks Range in a wilderness bigger than Belgium. Once we arrived, we saw wide bear trails bulldozed through alder thickets and plentiful signs of moose and wolves.

We had come here to begin a 500-mile journey that would take us in pack rafts down the Noatak River, believed to be the longest undeveloped river system left in the United States, and on foot, slogging the beaches of the Chukchi Sea coastline. Our goal was to get a close-up look at how warming temperatures are affecting this rugged but fragile Arctic landscape. Worldwide, roughly twice the amount of the heat-trapping carbon now in the atmosphere has been locked away in the planet’s higher latitudes in frozen ground known as permafrost. Now that ground is thawing and releasing its greenhouse gases.

The fire we flew over was our first visible sign of the changes underway.

While wildfires are part of the landscape’s natural regenerative cycle, they have until recently been infrequent above the Arctic Circle. But now the rising heat of the lengthening summers has dried out the tundra and the invasive shrubs that have recently moved north with the warmth. This is a tinderbox for lightning strikes. The fires expose and defrost the frozen soil, allowing greenhouse gases to escape into the atmosphere.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,0.34,"['Belgium', 'United States']",[]
491,2024-12-07,Mortgage Regulators Are Shrugging Off Climate Risk. It Could Cost Taxpayers Billions.,"One report has estimated that homes in places at risk of flooding were collectively overpriced by at least $187 billion; in some counties in Appalachia and coastal Louisiana, that amounts to more than 10 percent of the total property value. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office found that federally backed mortgages covered properties that were likely to sustain about $190 billion in flood damage over 30 years. That’s not counting the peril of wildfires or drought.

While banks are becoming more careful about extending credit in areas that might flood, and homeowners are responding to flood risk disclosures on property search websites, the government-sponsored enterprises do not formally take such risks into account when underwriting loans. Studies have found that banks are more likely to sell mortgages in risky areas to the secondary market, and to Fannie and Freddie specifically after hurricanes (a conclusion that economists funded by Fannie Mae have disputed).

Fannie and Freddie have generally relied on insurance to deal with climate risk management: Flood coverage is required in special flood hazard areas.

That has become a riskier gambit in recent years, however, as disasters have also hit places far beyond where federal flood maps say they’re supposed to. At the same time, extreme weather has driven up insurance costs nationwide. Recent research has found that those rising costs can drive homeowners into delinquency, even if the house avoids damage.

Unexpectedly large losses could undermine Fannie’s and Freddie’s profits and threaten their ability to keep the mortgage market liquid, said Susan Crawford, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who wrote a book last year about the impact of sea-level rise in Charleston, S.C.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.9368,[],['Charleston']

Heavy winds forced about 450 flight delays or cancellations before noon at San Francisco International Airport, according to FlightAware, a tracking website. Elsewhere in Northern California, rivers and creeks spilled over their banks after back-to-back days of pelting rain. Roads and fields flooded.

The dangerous weather, fed by an atmospheric river from the Pacific, started Tuesday in the Pacific Northwest, killing at least two people in the Seattle area and dumping heavy snow in the mountains.

To which the obvious rejoinder is: You’re right. Nowhere is safe.

But some places are less safe than others. Atop the list of unsafe places is New Orleans. But unlike the other major cities that appear on such lists (Phoenix; Norfolk, Va.; Tampa Bay, Fla; New York), New Orleans has a striking competitive advantage. It knows that every hurricane season poses an existential threat.

I’ve never met a New Orleanian who feels safe from climate change. Living here, rather, engenders hurricane expertise — and hurricane fatalism. You become your own disaster planner, insurance adjuster, land surveyor and roofer.

A quiet winemaking town on the upper reaches of the Magro River, inland from Valencia, Utiel sits about an hour’s drive from the sprawling, densely populated eastern coast of Spain that was inundated last month in some of Europe’s worst flooding in decades.

Heavy rains began in Utiel on the morning of Oct. 29. By about 1 p.m., the town’s narrow cobblestone streets were already filled with several inches of water. By 2 p.m., a muddy tide nearly reached the windows of the town’s low homes as the Magro spilled over its banks. Trash cans and cars drifted about like toy boats. By 3 p.m., the mayor said that he had alerted the firefighters and the military emergency unit.

The dangerous weather, fueled by the season’s first major atmospheric river from the Pacific Ocean, battered the region starting on Tuesday. Forceful winds wiped out power for half a million customers in Washington. Among the places hardest hit was the Seattle area, where falling trees killed two people.

The storm then moved into Northern California, where it disrupted hundreds of flights, flooded creeks, drenched San Francisco and brought heavy snow to parts of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges. On Saturday, a body was recovered in floodwaters in Sonoma County, local authorities said.

Though the storm is weakening as it inches south, residents are still reeling from the damage.

But as this second storm rapidly intensifies, the narrow band of rain will shift north, even back into Oregon, before quickly shifting south again. This storm is not expected to be nearly as intense as the one that arrived on Tuesday, but it will keep the atmospheric river going into Friday.

A rare high risk alert for excessive rain was issued for portions of coastal Northern California on Thursday, from Ukiah to just south of Fortuna, and forecasters warned that the compounding days of rainfall over the same area could lead to life-threatening flooding. Another three to six inches of rain is possible with some areas likely to receive closer to 10 inches, possibly pushing storm totals over 16 inches in a few locations. There will be significant flood risks through Thursday night and early Friday morning as the ground becomes saturated.

As the day goes on, the risk for landslides and debris flows also increases, especially over burn scars where fires have left soil less absorbent. Forecasters are especially concerned about a burn scar left from the Park fire, which scorched hundreds of thousands of acres this summer between Redding and Sacramento. That wildfire was the fourth largest in California’s history.

Friday: More rain for San Francisco

All he knew was that life in Asheville, N.C., had become more difficult and dirty.

But on Monday, he listened to every word of a voice mail message from the city informing him that, for the first time in 53 days, the water was clean enough to drink, a significant breakthrough for a place that has been dragged down by grief and financial hardship.

Mr. Watts, a landscaper who has had little work since the storm devastated western North Carolina, decided to have a beer at the Rankin Vault Lounge on Monday afternoon, but it was not quite celebratory.

500,2024-11-07,Natural Disaster Destroyed Part of València. Populism May Take Us All the Way Down.,"When water mixes with dirt it becomes mud, tons of mud, the kind of mud that, in the wake of flash floods on Oct. 29 and 30, has turned the Spanish region of València into a kind of war zone. More than 200 people are dead; nearly 90 are still missing; hundreds of houses, roads and railways are destroyed; and towns are cut off without electricity, water, or provisions. Hundreds of families have lost everything. Large swaths of the region have been transformed into a brown hell, reeking of decay, after rivers topped their banks, sending water coursing through towns and cities.

But there is more than one kind of mud.

When administrative incompetence mixes with political partisanship, as has happened here, then another kind of mud emerges: populism. In this catastrophe, those anti-government forces that have been swirling in the dark edges of Spanish politics for years are now feeding on the many levels of incompetence of the state, and the absence of an effective public response by regional or national authorities.

Right now both València and Spain, mired in this morass, are at risk of being engulfed by the zeitgeist undermining so many Western democracies — and summarized in the slogan that quickly emerged on Spanish social media after the floods: “Only the people save the people.” It is the old trick of populism: confronting established institutions with the philosophical falsehood of the peoples’s purity; the idea that the average citizen is more capable at solving the problems of society than the government is.

I was born here. I grew up here. I belong to a people — the Valèncian people — with an almost pathological obsession with water due to our history of severe droughts and torrential autumn rains. Water turned us into one of the main agricultural regions of the Mediterranean and enriched us with the export of our oranges, one of the largest sources of foreign currency in Spain during the years of Francisco Franco’s dictatorship. We had little industry but we had water, and that allowed us to survive.

504,2024-10-22,America’s Flooding Problem,"1. Fight the water

The first strategy is to fight the water: Build walls to keep it out of your city, along with giant pumps and drains to remove whatever water gets in. Think of Holland, much of which would be underwater without a massive network of barriers, or Venice, which now relies on sea walls during high tide.

But thanks to climate change, this approach means ever-more-epic fortifications. After Hurricane Katrina, the federal government built a $14 billion, 350-mile defensive ring around New Orleans. The United States is also looking at building 12 movable sea barriers to protect New York Harbor from a storm surge, at an initial cost of $52 billion.

Even the beneficiaries aren’t always thrilled. A plan to build a six-mile-long, 20-foot-high sea wall around the coast of Miami prompted outrage: It would, after all, ruin the view. The plan was abandoned.

2. Live with it

The second approach is to accept that water will get in, so we should live with it. This entails elevating homes off the ground, as builders do in the Outer Banks or coastal Louisiana. It also means raising roads, power stations and other critical infrastructure — all at no small cost.

Another example of living with water is described in an excellent new piece from my colleague Rory Smith, who visited a coastal plain in southwest England that used to be farmland protected by a sea wall. Officials converted it into a marsh when they realized it was best just to open up flood barriers, turning the area into a giant sponge.

In basic terms, eastern Spain was flooded this week because of a cutoff low: an area of low pressure that breaks away from the jet stream, the fast-moving current of wind that meanders west to east across the globe’s temperate regions.

When a cutoff low forms in the Gulf of Cádiz off southern Spain, it produces winds that blow warm, moist air from above the Mediterranean Sea toward the country’s eastern coast. This moisture-laden air hits the mountains and is pushed skyward, condensing into clouds that dump rain onto coastal areas including the province of Valencia.

Normally the jet stream would whisk such weather systems away relatively quickly. But because cutoff lows are detached from those winds, they can linger in place, blasting the same places with rain for days and days.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,-0.8765,['Spain'],['Valencia']

More than half a million people around the world were killed in those disasters since 2004.

“Many people now understand that climate change is already making life more dangerous,” said Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer at Imperial College London and co-founder of World Weather Attribution, the group that published the report. “What did not work yet is turning knowledge into action on a large-enough scale.”

Even with the abundance of evidence on how a warming world is endangering human life, the world keeps burning fossil fuels: 2023, the hottest year on record, also set a record for greenhouse gas emissions.

The stakes are high for how the world will respond in November, with a pivotal U.S. election and an annual climate summit of world leaders, known as COP29, hosted in Azerbaijan.

MacDill, which houses the headquarters for U.S. Special Operations Command and U.S. Central Command as well as a busy airfield, is only about 14 feet above sea level. That makes it vulnerable to flooding from a major storm surge like the one Milton may throw ashore when it makes landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday.

Troops and aircraft had only just returned following the destruction wrought by Hurricane Helene at the end of September when Milton exploded into a major hurricane. So, for the second time in three weeks, the base has been shut down and evacuated.

Those adaptations could include improved storm water management systems, better urban planning, more accessible early warning systems and growing investments in green infrastructure, like replacing concrete surfaces with more permeable materials or planting more trees.

“Our infrastructure was built for a climate that no longer exists,” said Diana Urge-Vorsatz, a professor at Central European University and vice chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But while these storms become more common, even experts can forget how pervasive they have become.

Before Storm Boris hit Central Europe, Dr. Urge-Vorsatz was warned by another climate scientist to stock up on enough food and emergency supplies to last at least three days. It’s going to be really bad, she said he had told her. She didn’t listen. Then floodwaters and strong winds threatened her home just outside Vienna.

But from the scramble to solve the mystery and quickly repair the leak, a different sort of picture emerges: of the resilience of the city’s infrastructure and of the everyday ingenuity and expertise required to maintain it.

A salty discovery

Workers for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the tunnel, first noticed the curious downpour in the eastbound tube around 10 a.m. Leaks are not unheard of, and at first it appeared routine. An initial report indicated that officials suspected that the water was coming from a broken main on the Queens end of the tunnel.

But there was no evidence to support that guess. So, as the water continued to pour in, a tunnel worker performed a simple test using the most sensitive of instruments: his tongue.

The water, the worker discovered, was salty.

528,2024-10-12,Hurricanes Amplify Insurance Crisis in Riskiest Areas,"Until late last month, there was optimism in the insurance industry. Hurricane season had been quiet and the number of wildfires was still below the yearly average. Insurers were beginning to hope that the cost of reinsurance — that is, insurance for insurers — would only inch up next year, instead of shooting higher as it did the previous two years.

Two major hurricanes have upended their calculations.

Total economic losses from Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene could soar over $200 billion, according to early estimates. While it’s far too soon to know exactly what portion will be covered by insurance companies, some consumer groups, lawmakers and analysts are already worried about a big hit to insurers’ finances that could ultimately affect millions of people living in the most vulnerable areas.

As climate change increases the intensity of natural disasters, insurance companies have pulled back from many high-risk areas by raising premiums or ending some types of coverage. The fallout from the two hurricanes, which landed within the span of two weeks, could accelerate that retreat. It could also further strain an already feeble federal flood insurance program that has filled in gaps for homeowners living in areas where private insurance companies no longer offer flood coverage.

The regions of Feni and Cumilla were worst hit, the country’s ministry of disaster management and relief said. Communication lines have been affected, with almost all cellphone towers losing electricity. Rail service has been suspended and roads have been damaged, hampering delivery of emergency aid. Bangladesh’s army and navy have been deployed for rescue operations.

Residents described water levels beyond any they had seen in recent years.

“I can recall a flood in 2004, but as I remember the water level wasn’t this high,” said Ahmed Farabee, 27, a resident of Noakhali, one of the worst-affected areas, where he estimated that 90 percent of homes were flooded with knee-high water. “This time, the rainwater couldn’t drain properly because the canals and wetlands are full,” he said.

530,2024-10-11,How Does Florida Insure Itself Against Hurricanes Like These?,"But getting there isn’t easy. Climate change has made living in Florida riskier, but when insurance companies try to charge actuarially fair premiums, they receive strong pushback. Nationally, the flood insurance market is so dysfunctional that the federal government has had to take over most of it. And that’s not working, either. Rates are still subsidized, though less than before, so taxpayers who live high and dry are potentially on the hook for losses by people who get flooded out, in some cases repeatedly.

So, what to do? While Florida can’t control the weather, there are things that it can do to reduce the economic damage that storms cause. It has done some of them, but there are still weaknesses in the system — and according to one recent study, a devastating hurricane in Florida could ripple all the way to the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

First the improvements: In 2019 and 2022, the State Legislature enacted laws that cracked down on insurance fraud and abuse. It was common in Florida for someone with an insurance claim to sell it for instant cash to a third party such as a roofer or a water extraction company. The new owner of the claim would sometimes do overpriced or shoddy work and then sue to get fully paid by the insurer. The reduction in so-called assignment of benefits insurance fraud and abuse has sharply slowed the rate of premium increases and allowed 15 companies to reduce their rates this year.

Under Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida has given grants totaling $250 million in the past year or so to help make homes hurricane-resistant. I don’t know if that’s sufficient, but it helps. A little money spent for protection can save a lot more when a storm hits.

There’s also been some progress on the issue of under-insurance, particularly against the risk of floods. People are required to have flood insurance to qualify for a federally regulated or insured mortgage only if where they live is estimated to have a 1 percent or higher chance of getting flooded in any given year. One carrier, Olympus Insurance, estimated that more than 850,000 Floridians in high-risk flood areas — presumably without such mortgages — don’t have flood insurance, whether they realize it or not.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.8329,[],['Florida']

The state’s leaders said Friday that initial assessments were that the damage inflicted by the storm, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane on Wednesday night south of Sarasota, was not as catastrophic as experts had feared, in large part because a dreaded surge of seawater around Tampa Bay never materialized.

But the heavy rainfall is coming our way as we make our way through tomorrow night. So it’s going to be a pretty stormy New Year’s Eve and a stormy entrance to the year 2023 coming to Southern California.

sabrina tavernise

Today, my colleague, Christopher Flavelle, says that the way California chose to deal with its water in the past has made today’s flooding worse and amounts to a missed opportunity for the future of California’s water crisis.

christopher flavelle

It serves to really illustrate how much of that valley really is a floodplain.

sabrina tavernise

Yeah. It’s Thursday, January 12. So, Chris, I keep catching glimpses in headlines about terrible weather in California — you know, catastrophic flooding, storms, evacuations, and even deaths. So tell me what’s happening in California right now.

christopher flavelle

There’s no single stat that captures what’s happening. So here’s a list of stats. As of now, you’ve got almost 5 million people under flood watches. You’ve got 60,000 households without power, evacuation orders in seven counties. 28 emergency shelters, two nursing homes had to be evacuated, 53 roads closed. The Santa Barbara Airport is closed. Rail lines are closed. And there’s more rain coming. According to FEMA this morning, total rainfall in the past few weeks in California has been 400 percent to 600 percent above average.

sabrina tavernise

Oh, my god.

christopher flavelle

So this is an epic event. So it’s hard to find a way to convey just how bad this is. The examples are heartbreaking. There’s a story about a five-year-old swept away from his mother’s arms, a toddler crushed by trees. “The LA Times” noted, compellingly, that the death toll so far is higher from these floods than the past two wildfire seasons combined.

sabrina tavernise

Oh, wow. That’s incredible.

christopher flavelle

So the human toll is excruciating.

sabrina tavernise

And it’s striking that it’s just, like, all over the state, right? It’s not just in the south, just in the north. It’s really everywhere.

christopher flavelle

Yeah, it’s rainfall event after rainfall event, each a bit different, hitting in different places. But they’re all impacting the same sort of system of dams and rivers and levees, gelling together into one megacatastrophe.

sabrina tavernise

And, Chris, explain this because it seems like this is just, as you say FEMA’s pointing out, far more than normal. What’s going on?

christopher flavelle

So the phrase that everyone has become painfully used to now is “atmospheric rivers.”

sabrina tavernise

Hold on. Remind me, though, what’s an atmospheric river?

christopher flavelle

Sure. “Atmospheric river” refers to a concentration — some call it a plume — of moisture high in the atmosphere. And what that means is as the wind and a storm system blows that over land, you get intense volumes of rainfall. And in California, there’s a pattern. My colleague Raymond Jong pointed this out in a masterful piece last year. Because of weather patterns in the Pacific and because of where California is, you’ve got a pattern of more intense and more severe rainfall moving in from the Pacific and delivering this kind of sustained, severe rainfall that just overwhelms California.

sabrina tavernise

And I assume all of this is made worse by climate change.

christopher flavelle

Yeah, and heavy rainfall and storms, of course, aren’t the only manifestation of climate change for California. These storms and floods are happening at the same time that California is grappling with a severe and ongoing drought, drought so bad that it challenges the notion of drought, right? A long-term decline in moisture levels — and wildfires, right? So you’ve got a landscape that’s really been primed to flood because the drought kills vegetation. So you get less vegetation on the ground to soak in the rain before it runs off. And wildfires leave burn scars across the landscape, which means even more sort of acceleration and velocity as that rain hits the ground and runs off. So it’s the combination of these different kinds of crises that together put California where it is. [MUSIC PLAYING] But those are just the natural factors. That’s just the natural climate and the weather patterns that California is wrestling with. There’s one thing that you can’t leave out of this discussion, which is the physical environment that’s been built by people in California for decades and even centuries, which is actually contributing to this, not just in the sense of greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change, but in the sense of how California has built its system for holding, managing, and flowing water through the state, because that system, as we’re now learning, has actually made California even more vulnerable to the kind of flooding that we’re seeing now and made the problem even worse than it would’ve been otherwise.

sabrina tavernise

So, Chris, explain that. What kind of system are we talking about here?

So the story begins in the second half of the 1800s, where California is beginning to realize that it’s got in the Central Valley a fantastic source of agricultural wealth. But there’s one big problem, which is water. The soil is fertile. There’s plenty of sunshine. What they don’t have is water at the right time, which is in the hottest season, in the summer. So the first turning point is in the early 1900s, where farmers get access to better technology to pull water out of the ground through wells and better pumps. And they use that to irrigate a whole new array of high-value crops. And the result is an explosion in farming and in wealth in the Central Valley. But if anything, they leaned into it a little bit too hard because by the 1930s, they could tell that groundwater was being drained far faster than it could be replenished. And so it became clear by the ‘30s something had to change. So California began embarking on what’s been called the largest public works project ever at the time, which was the Central Valley Project, building a series of enormous dams that would capture runoff from the Sierra Nevada, hold it behind dams, and route it as irrigation water through this empire of farms that had sprung up in the Central Valley. At the same time, the federal government built the Hoover Dam, which allowed it to harness the water of the Colorado River, which was another source of irrigation and drinking water for California and the states around it. So you got these two megaprojects that together just transformed the landscape and the potential of California.

sabrina tavernise

So a major feat of engineering.

christopher flavelle

An unbelievable feat of engineering, and it worked. It turned the Central Valley into arguably the most important patch of farmland in the US and maybe in the world. It produces about a quarter of the food that the US consumes, almost half of some fruits and nuts. And it’s really a core pillar of California’s economy, which is the fifth-largest economy in the world.

sabrina tavernise

OK, but so how are those decisions from decades ago which drove California’s success making the situation now in California worse?

christopher flavelle

Well, there’s two problems that arise from the way the system has been built. The first one is when you get severe, intense rain events, there’s just not enough room for that water. You get more flooding because the channels that have been created for those waters by building those levees just become too narrow for the volume of water that you get. You can imagine a world before levees, or with no levees, where, when you get intense rainfall, the water just goes everywhere and fills the land. People will sometimes refer to the Central Valley as the Inland Sea because it had a propensity to flood during parts of the year and even have standing water. That no longer makes sense, because we’ve had almost 200 years of farming and large-scale developments. You can’t just let water go everywhere at this point in the Valley without causing massive destruction to fields and orchards and towns and cities. And so the challenge is finding a way to control the water without being too aggressive so it’s got nowhere to go.

sabrina tavernise

Right. You know, if there were no farms or towns there, a flood wouldn’t be a big deal, right? But because there are levees that allowed for all that development, it is a massively big deal, as we’re seeing right now.

christopher flavelle

That’s right. At some level, you can’t reset the clock, right? You can’t just erase the developments and the agriculture that now defines the Central Valley. The best you can do is try and find a way to really tinker with the system because those farms and people aren’t going away.

sabrina tavernise

Right.

christopher flavelle

But there’s another fundamental problem with California’s approach to water as rainstorms get worse. And that is that the system that the state uses now doesn’t try to take advantage of all this excess water to recharge the state’s all-important aquifers.

sabrina tavernise

OK. So help me understand what an aquifer is.

christopher flavelle

Wherever you are in the world, the ground beneath you isn’t solid. In many cases, there are porous structures. There’s space between the rocks. There’s even caverns. That space often holds water. And that water is accumulated over centuries and millennia from rainfall and from glaciers. It’s a gigantic reserve of water that can be pulled up out of the ground through wells and used to irrigate crops or provide drinking water for people. And that aquifer, that groundwater, is really arguably California’s most important resource. And it’s been heavily drained down, depleted by more than a century of farming and population growth. And flooding could be — could be — a way to help recharge that groundwater so there’s more of it for the future.

sabrina tavernise

OK. So then, what do you mean when you say that the system the state has now doesn’t take advantage of this flood water to replenish the groundwater, the aquifer?

christopher flavelle

Right now, the system is you’ve got these giant reservoirs, dams, and they’re meant to capture this excess floodwater, which is great. You can use it later. But it only does so much. And you’ve got, as we’ve seen, water going where it’s not meant to go, right? So every time a community or a home gets flooded, in addition to the tragedy that is for people who live there, it’s a waste because that is — you just get horrible, disgusting runoff that makes its way to the ocean, right?

sabrina tavernise

That no one can use.

christopher flavelle

Yeah. I’m not somebody who thinks the world must always be how it’s always been. But there is something to the idea that this is the system nature built, right? These rivers take the course they do. And that’s what made this farmland so fertile in the first place, right? They flood regularly. The sediment spreads across fields. And the aquifer is where you need it, right? The aquifer that you want in the Central Valley is in the Central Valley, right? So if the water leaves the valley and heads to the coast, you’ve lost it. Even if it sort of drips into marginal aquifers underneath Santa Barbara, that doesn’t help the almond grower in Bakersfield.

sabrina tavernise

Right.

christopher flavelle

The way advocates put it to me was that if you deliberately and intentionally widen the rivers, you get better groundwater recharge where it’s supposed to happen, reaching the aquifers that you want to use for farming, rather than that water rushing into towns and cities and, sure, reaching into the soil. But a lot of it just runs off, causes mudslides and landslides, destroys homes, and causes all kinds of havoc in the meantime.

sabrina tavernise

So what you’re saying is that because of the way the system was set up, those floodwaters aren’t going back into the ground in the most efficient way.

christopher flavelle

That’s right. And the cost of not grabbing that water to recharge aquifers in the most efficient way, the cost of that decision keeps on going up, right? Because the surface water is drying up. It’s going away — both reduced snowpack off the mountains and reduced flow from the Colorado River. So if anything, this is an especially difficult time just to let that huge surplus of rainwater flow by, because that groundwater is becoming more and more important as sources of surface water dry up.

sabrina tavernise

Got it.

christopher flavelle

And as that surface water dries up, farmers are already turning more heavily toward groundwater. In fact, the number of dry wells reported to the state jumped in 2021. So this isn’t some future problem. Farmers are already trying to cope with reduced groundwater, even as groundwater becomes more important because surface water is slowly going away, too.

sabrina tavernise

I mean, if the surface water goes away and the groundwater goes away, you’ve got nothing, right? That’s it.

christopher flavelle

You’ve got nothing. And I’ve met vineyard growers in California who will truck in water because they lose surface water and groundwater. But that’s not sustainable.

sabrina tavernise

Right.

christopher flavelle

That’s so high-cost. You can’t keep it going for long. So, yeah, you start talking about the end of farming areas when your groundwater and your surface water aren’t available. It’s really terrible. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

So what are they going to do? I mean, is it fixable?

christopher flavelle

It is fixable. And not only that, everyone seems to agree what the fix is. The catch is the obstacles to actually doing that are almost insurmountable.

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. OK, so California’s having this severe flooding problem. And it’s being made a lot worse by systems designed over decades to essentially tame nature. So what would it take today to solve this problem?

christopher flavelle

You know, the short answer is pretty straightforward. You can make more room for the river by pulling back the levees and setting aside more land on either side of these rivers so that when there is really intense rainfall, there’s more room for the water and more chance for that water to sink down and recharge the aquifers. The problem is doing that is really, really, really hard.

sabrina tavernise

Why is it so hard, Chris?

christopher flavelle

Start with the economics, right? If you want to pull a significant chunk of land out of agricultural use, out of residential use, and you’re the state, you’ve got to buy that land.

sabrina tavernise

Right.

christopher flavelle

So you got to find the money to buy that land, and many homeowners and farmers won’t want to sell that land. So at some point, you don’t just buy it. You’ve got to seize it through eminent domain. So that gets into the politics. Politically, there’s nothing quite as painful as when state or local officials try to force people off their land. But maybe even more overwhelming than the economic challenge of buying the land or the political challenge of taking the land, and just the cultural barrier to this, because, culturally, California, like the rest of the West, was built on the philosophy that, as you said, we can tame nature. We can bend nature and make it work for our goals. And the underpinnings of this idea of more room for the rivers is that at some point, you can’t keep taming nature. You’ve got to bend to nature and accept that human plans have limitations. And those limitations are getting more pronounced with climate change. And I don’t know how you get a community or a state or a country to that point where people are willing to accept that we can’t always tame nature.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so very hard politically. But wouldn’t another downside be California as breadbasket? I mean, wouldn’t we lose a significant amount of agricultural land?

christopher flavelle

Doing this, making more room for the rivers, would definitely involve taking some farmland out of production. But from the conversations I had for reporting this story, it didn’t seem like, as a total share of Central Valley farmland, this would mean taking a huge amount out of production. And it could arguably make the whole system more sustainable because the farmland that remains would have more groundwater to draw on in the future. And in general, I couldn’t find anybody who said that this would have serious negative consequences. Everyone seemed to agree this was going to be beneficial in the long run if we could do it.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so it sounds like the hardest thing here is that it’s a political loser, right? It would cost a ton of money, which would probably mean more taxes, which people hate. And it would make some people have to give up their way of life, all in service of some long-term benefit, which you know, Chris, especially as a climate reporter, people really don’t want. They don’t want to do that.

christopher flavelle

Absolutely. And to California’s credit, they’re starting to do some projects along these lines, some pilot projects. But to make it work at scale, as you said, would just be so hard politically, economically, and culturally, that it’s a great example of the big change that you need as these weather patterns and weather extremes get worse. And the question is always, will lawmakers and officials want to take the chance? To be clear, this isn’t a panacea. Even if California can pull this off and give its rivers more room, that wouldn’t solve the problem of flood damage. And it wouldn’t solve the problem of access to water for irrigation, for drinking water, for cities. Those things would remain challenges. But having said all that, there is some good news here, which is that despite all the practical impediments and obstacles to actually making these changes, if California could do it, it would be that rare case in climate adaptation where you’ve got a single change that can check a bunch of different boxes all at the same time, right? You can reduce the severity of flooding. You can increase groundwater recharge. You can even provide new habitat for wildlife in these reclaimed river areas. From my reporting on adapting to climate change, it’s rare to find a solution or a policy change where you get all those different wins at once.

sabrina tavernise

Right. And you talk about rare. I mean, it’s also presumably pretty rare to solve an effect of climate change — the drought in California — by harnessing another effect of climate change, the rains.

christopher flavelle

That’s right. There’s almost a beautiful symmetry to it, taking two challenges from climate change and almost directing them against each other to help with both. So California, in a sense, is lucky, right? If you compare it to other states in the Southwest, like Nevada and Arizona, they don’t have the good luck of having to fight through too much rain and too much flooding. The outlook in those places is a lot less sunny. But California at least has a chance to turn this around. And bear in mind the storm that California is suffering through right now is not the worst it’s going to see. As my colleague Raymond Jong has written, California has to worry about much worse megastorms, the kind of storms that lasts for 30 days without a pause. Those storms are what could make this decision about more room for the river look like it’s not just a luxury, but something that California has to fix, because as these floods get worse, the damage will grow and just becomes catastrophic.

Its path of destruction was uneven, though, and in many areas, officials were working to make repairs.

Some places near the Gulf of Mexico, as well as farther inland, were inundated, though not to the degree that officials had feared. Many homes in the storm’s path were leveled — by one early estimate, more than 120 were destroyed — while other structures nearby remained intact. At least 14 deaths have been linked to the storm.

“We did not get the worst-case scenario,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said after the storm passed. “But we did get hit, and we’re going to have to work to bounce back.”

Here is what we know about the storm and its impact.

How bad was the damage from the hurricane?

The damage varied from one county to the next. The Tampa Bay region did not experience the disastrous storm surge that many forecasters had feared. Still, there was serious flooding along the Gulf Coast, which received as much as 18 inches of rain.

534,2020-09-19,"After Fire and Floods, Glimmers of Hope","During the increasingly common ecological disasters that visit this country, there inevitably arises the hope that Americans and their elected politicians will learn from the experience, adopt new policies and provide for a less destructive future. We are now in such a period, with two unfolding climate-fueled disasters occurring at once: Savage wildfires in the West that have consumed more than five million acres of forests and scrublands and taken multiple lives in four states, and a Category 2 hurricane that has brought dangerous flooding and widespread damage to the Florida Panhandle.

Once again, disaster has yielded glimmers of hope, or at least evidence of common sense. A recent Times article by Christopher Flavelle, a Washington-based climate reporter, notes that Americans by substantial margins support much stronger building codes and even outright bans on new construction in flood- and fire-prone zones. Eighty-four percent of people surveyed supported mandatory building codes in risky areas, and well over half supported outright bans. One interesting aspect of these findings — drawn from a joint survey by Stanford University, the environmental research group Resources for the Future and the survey company ReconMR — is that a majority of Republicans favored tougher rules. That’s surprising because Republicans tend to be much more skeptical about global warming than Democrats and, more to the point, much more hostile to government regulation.

The survey, however, also highlights a depressing underside: While the public’s appreciation of the dangers of building in risky areas may be shifting, attitudes in state and local governments and the real estate industry have hardly budged. These are the entities that hold the cards when it comes to residential construction. For all sorts of reasons, not least the need for property tax revenues for schools and other purposes, local communities want to build, even when the environmental risks seem self-evident. According to the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, an advocacy group that works to strengthen homes from natural and man-made disasters, just one-third of local jurisdictions in the United States have adopted disaster-resistant building codes. Not surprisingly, the idea of flatly banning new homes outright in at-risk areas is anathema, even among climate-sensitive politicians. In an interview with The Associated Press last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who has adopted several useful fire-prevention measures, seemed nearly offended when asked whether he would ban home building in at-risk areas.

537,2024-07-28,How the Shock of Catastrophic Floods Is Changing Farming in Vermont,"Vermont farmers have long adapted to the twists and turns of climate: tapping maple trees earlier as winters have warmed, for example, and investing less in berry crops as hotter, wetter weather makes them more vulnerable to pests and fungus. But the shock of last summer’s catastrophic flooding — followed by another damaging deluge on July 11, and a third on Tuesday — underscored a level of risk that is hard to mitigate, given the state’s mountainous terrain and its proximity to the Atlantic.

The warming ocean allows more moisture to evaporate into the atmosphere, fueling storms and heavy rains. And mountains funnel water rapidly downhill, raising the danger that streams and rivers will overflow and low-lying land will quickly flood.

“These are rural areas, without a lot of wealth and population, which can make it hard to adapt to climate change,” said Tim Waring, an associate professor at the University of Maine who studies cultural adaptation in agriculture. “We need to be supporting people so they can experiment, and then have conversations about their experiments.”

Certain aspects of farming in Vermont might help, he said: The state’s growing cohort of younger farmers may adapt to the new circumstances more easily than older farmers. Their close ties make it easier to share new strategies. And the diverse output of the state’s farms builds in some economic buffers — if one crop is lost, another may survive — while also fostering flexibility and openness to new approaches.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.8439,[],[]

Fossil fuel pollution has made them a fixture of life around the world, and they are going to get worse — with millions of people in their cross hairs.

Many Americans refuse to believe that a major hurricane could hit them. The United States government isn’t much better. Flood insurance remains optional for many coastal residents. Homes continue to be built — and rebuilt — in low-lying flood zones. State governments often lack the funds and staffing to manage recovery. Some loans from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to rebuild are contingent on good credit. But if we are going to withstand this new era of extreme weather, we need to be honest about what has become the most expensive and deadliest kind of natural disaster in the country.

I spent the past three years sailing through storms and visiting research labs around the world to learn about the recent increase in extreme cyclones. I spoke to captains who logged changes in the Gulf Stream, the jet stream, trade winds and storm seasons. I interviewed scientists who studied amplifying typhoons in the Pacific, whose barometric pressure could drop so low that they triggered a spider web of earthquakes. I studied major cyclones that hit parts of the Middle East for the first time and some of the first hurricane landfalls to strike Europe. Experts consistently tied storm intensity, range and destruction to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere — and said that if we reduced it, storm intensity would diminish in lock step.

Here is a glimpse of where we are headed. The heat accumulating in the ocean from global warming will make tropical cyclones last longer than they once did and occasionally move slower, making damage many times worse.

It can be tempting to attribute all floods and other extreme events to the forces of warming planet. But weather is not climate, even though weather can be affected by climate. For example, scientists are confident that climate change makes unusually hot days more common. They’re not as sure that climate change is making tornadoes more severe.

The storm submerged railroad cars and leveled trees and utility poles. Eight people died in the storm, nearly half drowned by the storm surge that inundated the shoreline.

Mr. Davis said Tampa Bay was also hit by three major storms in the 1800s, including a hurricane known as the Great Gale of 1848. That one destroyed nearly all the buildings in the area, which was then little more than a settlement of several hundred people near a military outpost, Fort Brooke.

Timing is critical, Mr. Davis said.

“This is the time of year where the tracks have a higher chance of hitting the Tampa Bay region from the Gulf of Mexico,” he said. “The previous storms that hit Tampa did just this. They formed in the Western Gulf and they went almost straight east into parts of the Florida peninsula, right around Tampa Bay.”

The 1921 storm struck in late October; the storm in 1848, in late September.

Hurricane Milton, which rapidly intensified in the Gulf of Mexico on Monday, becoming a Category 5 storm, is expected to make landfall somewhere near Tampa as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday, according to the Weather Service.

Like in 1921, the storm surge is expected to be 10 to 15 feet.

The flood, fueled by torrential rains that fell atop melting snow tore out much of the river’s template — the physical features of the river — and built a new one.

545,2022-04-07,How to Clean a Flooded Basement,"Microbial growth, including mold, can start anywhere between 24 and 72 hours after a flooding event, so drying your space early is crucial. “You want to always assume that there’s potential for mold growth,” Rivera said. “Always assume the worst, because if you don’t and you ignore it, six months down the line you might have a huge mold issue that could have been avoided if you just properly dried out whatever was wet.”

Setting up fans to increase the drying process feels instinctual, but if you own a dehumidifier, that’s a much better option. A fan will speed up evaporation, but as Rivera pointed out, what that does is “increase the relative humidity in the air.” And that means you wind up with lingering water that still needs to be removed.

Justin Bowe pointed out another disadvantage of fans: “They’re blowing dust around.” Fans are absolutely better than nothing, but your best bet is a good dehumidifier. If fans are your only option, make sure to open your windows and confirm that the humidity of the outside air isn’t high.

Keep your dehumidifier and/or fan on until everything is dry; many of our experts recommend keeping the appliances on for a full 72 hours just to be safe.

Dehumidifier

To help dehumidify a basement after water damage, we recommend the Midea 50 Pint Cube. It’s unique among 50-pint dehumidifiers in that it can collect 4.25 gallons of water—twice the typical amount. That means fewer trips to empty the bucket.

However, to access the bucket, you have to lift off the upper compressor unit, which weighs 38 pounds, and a full bucket itself weighs 40 pounds.

The Cube performed very well in our testing, both in its ability to lower the humidity and in the quietness of its operation. Midea dehumidifiers also receive far fewer complaints about mechanical failures than other manufacturers’ machines.

However, a dehumidifier is potentially only scratching the surface of remediation that may be necessary after flooding.

If your basement is partially finished and water has made contact with any portion of drywall, make sure that moisture hasn’t gotten inside. “You can have a piece of drywall get wet a hundred times, never be dried properly, and never have a mold issue,” Rivera said. “You can have the same piece of drywall under different conditions get wet one time and have a mold issue.”

A professional will remove the baseboards from any affected area and cut sections of drywall out before positioning fans and dehumidifiers in front of the gaps to dry the insides. If the flooding is light, Marrero recommends that homeowners perform a smaller-scale version of this method. “You carefully detach the baseboard by scoring it with a razor, and pull it back with maybe a spatula or a putty knife,” he said. “You don’t want to do damage to the wall, you want to try to save it as best you can. Once the base trim is off, you can take a screwdriver or the butt of a hammer and put small holes along the baseline where that water damage is.”

If you have a drill, you can use that instead to make small holes, and then you can place your fans and/or dehumidifier in front of the open spaces. “Airflow is going to carry through the wall cavity,” Marrero said. “You can always patch and paint the drywall later.” Since you can’t see the inside of the wall, it’s best to play it safe and reattach the baseboard only after 72 hours, since you won’t be able to feel the inside of the wall to tell if it’s dry.

If any part of your basement is carpeted, everyone I spoke with recommended pulling up the carpeting and padding and throwing it away. “Carpet and the padding below acts like a giant sponge,” Rivera said. “For the average homeowner, a shop vac isn’t going to be able to suck that amount of water out. If you have gray padding, or what we call horsehair padding, it’s going to stink. I mean on the first day.”

Dry any possessions that got wet in whatever manner you can; editor-in-chief Ben Frumin was able to take the contents of his basement out into his yard to dry in the sun. Every situation will be different, so all we can say is use common sense and maybe take this water damage as an opportunity to clear out some junk.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,2,0.9862,[],"['Rivera', 'Marrero']"
546,2024-04-18,Dubai’s Extraordinary Flooding: Here’s What to Know,"Scenes of flood-ravaged neighborhoods in one of the planet’s driest regions stunned the world this month. Heavy rains in the United Arab Emirates and Oman submerged cars, clogged highways and killed at least 21 people. Flights out of Dubai’s airport, a major global hub, were severely disrupted.

The downpours weren’t a total surprise — forecasters had anticipated the storms several days earlier and issued warnings. But they were certainly unusual.

Here’s what to know.

Heavy rain there is rare, but not unheard-of.

On average, the Arabian Peninsula receives a scant few inches of rain a year, although scientists have found that a sizable chunk of that precipitation falls in infrequent but severe bursts, not as periodic showers. These rains often come during El Niño conditions like the ones the world is experiencing now.

U.A.E. officials said the 24-hour rain total on April 16 was the country’s largest since records there began in 1949.

556,2023-11-05,"Living in a Neighborhood That Floods, Rain or Shine","In the Rockaways, a low-lying peninsula in Queens that separates the Atlantic Ocean from Jamaica Bay, life has long been shaped by the tides. High-tide floods are not caused by the weather but by the twice monthly alignment of the Earth, sun and moon. When there is a full or a new moon, the sun and moon exert a gravitational pull that causes tides to swell.

But as climate change causes sea levels to rise, high tide floods — sometimes called nuisance floods or sunny-day floods because they can happen on clear days — are likely to inundate more coastal neighborhoods across the five boroughs.

By 2050, Lower Manhattan could see 85 days of high-tide flooding annually, a fivefold increase. By the end of this century, 600,000 city residents could be affected by regular tidal flooding, according to the New York City Comptroller’s office.

557,2022-08-05,How floods become human catastrophes,"To my colleague, Christopher Flavelle, who focuses on how people, governments and industries try to cope with the effects of global warming, the answer seemed painfully obvious. So I asked him to spell it out.

Somini: What made the latest floods so destructive, in human terms?

Chris: The risk you face from floods like this is based on two things: How exposed you are and how vulnerable you are. You are exposed if, say, you live in a steep valley that’s quick to flood during intense storms. You are vulnerable if you live in a home that’s not built to withstand floods like this. In low-income communities in Kentucky and other parts of Appalachia, physical exposure and social vulnerability overlap in a dangerous and often tragic way.

Housing has a lot to do with it. Houses aren’t always built to code. In fact, in much of Kentucky, there’s no enforcement of residential building codes for single-family homes, according to the International Code Council, a Washington-based nonprofit that oversees the development of those codes.

Somini: Insurance has a lot to do with it too, as you wrote about recently.

Chris: The hard truth of United States disaster policy is that, if your home gets destroyed by a flood and you don’t have flood insurance, don’t count on government aid to make up the difference. The Federal Emergency Management Agency may provide help, but it probably won’t be enough to repair your home. Congress has no standard for deciding when to provide extra money to rebuild homes that are lost. And even if lawmakers come up with those funds, they could take years to reach people who need them.

So if you don’t buy flood insurance because it seems too expensive, you’re unlikely to have the savings you need to recover if your house gets destroyed. That’s a position that more and more Americans are going to find themselves in as climate change makes floods more frequent and intense. Moreover, out-of-date flood maps mean some people don’t have a good way to find out how much risk they face.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,0,-0.932,['United States'],[]

The towns of Carmel, Monterey and Pacific Grove are also at risk of being isolated from the rest of the county, local officials said, should floodwaters on critical roadways rise too high.

Officials on Friday prepared for the possibility by positioning ambulances, high-water vehicles and other emergency equipment in the areas that could be isolated by rising waters, Maia Carroll, the communications coordinator for Monterey County, said.

It is difficult to determine a precise number of accidental drownings in cars because vehicle fatalities are classified differently from region to region, said Gordon Giesbrecht, a professor at the University of Manitoba who has studied drownings and human responses to extreme environments. But he estimated that about 350 to 400 people a year drown in their cars in the United States and Canada after their vehicle falls into a body of water or becomes stranded in flooding.

He urged people to get out of their vehicle as soon as possible, saying there may be very little time before the water becomes inescapable.

Many of the same areas that suffered through the Black Summer bush fires in 2019 and 2020, the worst in the country’s recorded history, are now dealing with prodigious rainfall during the wettest, coldest November since at least 1900.

Hundreds of people across several states have been forced to evacuate. Many more are stranded on floodplain islands with no way to leave except by boat or helicopter, possibly until after Christmas.

And with a second year of the weather phenomenon known as La Niña in full swing, meteorologists are predicting even more flooding for Australia’s east coast, adding to the stress from the pandemic and a recent rural mouse plague of biblical proportions.

Yet no one died in the Netherlands in the July flooding. Some tributaries did wreak extensive damage in the border region, but along the Maas River, which swelled to epic proportions, large urban centers stayed safe and dry.

The Dutch are experienced in water management, having dealt with sea-level rise and river floods long before climate change became a concern. More than half the country lies beneath sea level, and while the ocean is held back by more conventional flood control methods, river management has changed drastically.

Mr. Van der Broeck’s project, Maaspark Ooijen-Wanssum, a nature preserve near the small city of Wanssum, lies at the heart of the new approach. During the flooding it did exactly what it was supposed to, absorbing so much water that levels in parts of the Maas River dropped by 13 inches, enough to avert a major disaster.

“If we hadn’t freed up the areas to reroute the excess water from the Maas River, Venlo and Roermond would have been flooded,” Mr. van der Broeck said of two regional cities. “For a long time we have worked against nature,” he said. “The river is telling us it needs more space.

The storm — which intensified from predawn showers to heavy rain, high winds and, in some places, flash flood warnings — sent Californians from the Northern California coast to Santa Barbara scrambling for shelter, and left hundreds of thousands without power. A succession of similar weather systems is expected to pound the state for the next several days.

Usually, rainfall amounts like those expected this week would not have a significant effect. But the rain over the past weekend saturated the ground across much of California, forecasters said, leaving it like a wet sponge and making it more susceptible to flooding and rapid runoff.

The Pearl River reached its highest marks during the devastating floods of 1983 and 1979, two of the worst to hit the central part of the state in recent history. The 1979 event set the record, with the river cresting at 43 feet, submerging a large area of Jackson, including downtown.

The new flood has created yet another test for Mr. Reeves, the Republican who took office just over a month ago and has already faced a spell of destructive weather, including heavy rains and tornadoes, and a crisis inside the state’s prisons that escalated after a surge of violence and discord in recent weeks.

As the severity of the flood grew more evident on Saturday, Mr. Reeves joined local officials in beseeching residents in the potential flood zone to head out while they could still do so without the help of rescuers. “The water is coming,” Mike Word, the director of emergency operations for Rankin County, said in a televised briefing before the spillway was opened. “We have told you and told you and told you this. So please, heed our warnings.”

The National Flood Insurance Program

About 75 percent of all flood insurance policies are administered by FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program. You can buy one of these policies through a local insurance broker or get referred to one by calling the national program at (888) 379-9531.

Any renter, homeowner or business owner in one of the 23,000 participating communities is eligible for a policy, with rates set by FEMA. But those rates are changing. Currently, the average annual premium is $734, according to ValuePenguin. But a new rating system, called Risk Rating 2.0, which FEMA rolled out this month, takes into account a home’s location, its size and its overall flood risk. While 23 percent of policy holders will see their rates drop under the changes, 66 percent could see their rates rise by as much as $120 a year, and 4 percent could see their rates rise by $240 a year. Existing policyholders will see rates rise beginning in April. Lawmakers from coastal states, including New York and New Jersey, have urged Congress to block the new rates.

The national program’s coverage is reliable, but it’s limited. Residential policies max out at $250,000 for the building and $100,000 for contents. And not all contents are covered. If your basement floods, your policy could replace your walls, boiler and hot-water heater, but not the cost of replacing any personal possessions in the basement, like sofas, televisions and clothes.

If you have a finished basement or live in an expensive area like New York, a national flood policy would probably not make you whole in a major disaster. “If you have a $500,000 home, you may have a huge gap” in coverage, Mr. Friedlander said.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.9237,['Jersey'],['New York']
580,2020-07-14,New Data Shows an ‘Extraordinary’ Rise in U.S. Coastal Flooding,"WASHINGTON — Parts of the United States saw record levels of high-tide flooding last year as rising seas brought water further into coastal homes and infrastructure, government scientists reported Tuesday.

The increase in high-tide flooding along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts since 2000 has been “extraordinary,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported, with the frequency of flooding in some cities growing fivefold during that time. That shift is damaging homes, imperiling the safety of drinking water, inundating roads and otherwise hurting coastal communities, the agency said.

“Conditions are changing, and not just in a few locations,” Nicole LeBoeuf, acting assistant administrator for NOAA’s National Ocean Service, which compiled the report, said during a call with reporters. “Damaging floods that decades ago happened only during a storm now happen more regularly, even without severe weather.”

NOAA defines high-tide flooding, also called sunny-day or nuisance flooding, as water rising more than half a meter, or about 20 inches, above the normal daily high-tide mark. The frequency of that flooding has increased because of rising sea levels, which were roughly 13 inches higher nationally last year than in 1920, the agency reported.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,scientific report,0,0,0,0.7081,['United States'],[]

For years, even as seas rose and flooding worsened nationwide, policymakers stuck to the belief that relocating entire communities away from vulnerable areas was simply too extreme to consider — an attack on Americans’ love of home and private property as well as a costly use of taxpayer dollars. Now, however, that is rapidly changing amid acceptance that rebuilding over and over after successive floods makes little sense.

The shift threatens to uproot people not only on the coasts but in flood-prone areas nationwide, while making the consequences of climate change even more painful for cities and towns already squeezed financially.

This month, the Federal Emergency Management Agency detailed a new program, worth an initial $500 million, with billions more to come, designed to pay for large-scale relocation nationwide. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has started a similar $16 billion program.

In a viral video, a 79-year-old farmer in Henan Province wiped away tears as he surveyed the damage.

The unusually heavy rainfall, which local officials said was the worst disruption to the wheat harvest in a decade, underscored the risks that climate shocks pose to President Xi Jinping’s push for China to become more self-reliant in its food supply.

Ensuring China’s ability to feed 1.4 billion people is a key piece of Mr. Xi’s goal of leading the country to superpower status. In recent years, tensions with the United States, the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s war on Ukraine have all created more volatility in global food prices, heightening the urgency for China to grow more of its own crops.

The country has not experienced food price inflation at the levels seen in other major economies, but officials are concerned about the vulnerability of its food supply to global shocks. Last summer, prices for pork, fruit and vegetables spiked in China, prompting the government to release pork from its strategic reserves to stabilize prices.

The strike on the dam, on the strategic Inhulets River, could have been a disaster for civilians in the city but it also likely served a military purpose. The Ukrainian military has been hastily building lightweight pontoon bridges to cross the Inhulets River, and some military strategists and Ukrainian officials believed the Russians had targeted the dam to disrupt that effort.

“The Kryvyi Rih dam missile strike was an attempt to stop the Ukrainian offensive in Kherson by flooding the Inhulets River and destroying Ukrainian pontoons,” said Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the Ukrainian president.

The ongoing offensive in Ukraine’s south is concentrated on land controlled by Russia west of the Dnipro River, which bisects Ukraine from north to south. Unlike the surprise assault in the northeast last week, Ukraine heavily telegraphed its southern offensive weeks in advance by pounding Russian supply lines and critical river crossings in an attempt to trap Russian soldiers on the west bank of the river.

Officials in Kryvyi Rih were still assessing the full extent of damage to the dam on Thursday. The 200-meter-long structure holds back almost 300 million tons of water in a yawning reservoir. It was created in Soviet times to supply the mining and metallurgical enterprises of this heavily industrialized area.

Flash floods can develop quickly, within hours or even minutes; and they often catch people off guard, killing an average of 88 people in the United States each year.

“Flash floods occur when there’s just too much water coming in too fast,” said Bonnie Schneider, a meteorologist and author of “Extreme Weather.” And climate change is compounding the risks: Warmer air holds more moisture, Ms. Schneider said, which can lead to heavier, more intense rainfall.

Though flash floods are scary, experts say you can increase your odds of survival by staying informed and having a plan. Here’s what to do in advance — and in the moment — to get through a flash flood safely.

Understand the difference between the various alerts.

The death came on Wednesday, after skies had already cleared across the state, Vermont officials said: A 63-year-old man died in a drowning accident at his home in Barre, a small city near Montpelier, the capital.

Here’s what to know about the flooding:

Thousands of residents lost their homes or businesses to the storm.

The storm first struck New York State on Sunday, with one death there attributed to fast-moving floodwaters. In less than four hours, more than seven inches of rain fell at West Point. Service was suspended on Monday on several train lines in the state, including Metro-North’s Hudson and Harlem lines, because of washouts and fallen trees, mud and boulders blocking the tracks.

The storm system then moved north into New England, causing severe flooding and forcing hundreds of people in Vermont to evacuate their homes.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,1,0,0,-0.9904,[],"['New York', 'Hudson']"

It was the latest in a series of deadly environmental disasters to hit West and Central African countries this year.

Many neighborhoods, major infrastructure and key roads were still underwater or in ruins on Wednesday after the previous day’s all-night downpour brought the worst floods in years to the city of 15 million people. Nearly 40,000 households were flooded and 280 collapsed, according to an official document seen by The New York Times.

President Félix Tshisekedi, who is in Washington for a U.S.-Africa summit, declared three days of mourning and said he would cut his trip short, flying back to Kinshasa on Thursday after meeting with President Biden.

The storm was going to be bad, that much was clear. But no one said she needed to start packing.

In the wake of the devastation that leveled swaths of her town of Black Mountain, N.C., and that killed a friend when he was swept into the Swannanoa River, Ms. Moody is hesitant to point fingers. But she can’t help but wonder if evacuation orders might have helped save lives.

“The alert said, Stay in the house. Stay away from the window. But no one said to leave,” Ms. Moody, a 53-year-old UPS worker, said. “Next time they should ask us to leave. This storm was notorious. It was mean. It was raging.”

Across the inland region where Helene leveled towns and turned deadly, residents and public officials faced a reckoning this week.

602,2020-01-14,Why a Water Main Break Flooded the Subway,"New York City’s drinking water system erupted into the streets yesterday, disrupting the morning rush by flooding subway lines and a swath of the Upper West Side around Lincoln Center.

The flood snarled traffic and caused bus detours.

But the water main break also spotlighted the chronic problem lurking below the city’s streets: the labyrinth of water mains — some of which are more than a century old and prone to leaks and cracks — train tunnels and other old equipment that make up one of the world’s largest networks of subterranean infrastructure.

[Subway service was disrupted after a water main break on the Upper West Side.]

When the flood came

The break occurred around 62nd Street and Broadway just before 5 a.m., halting subway service along a stretch of the No. 1, 2 and 3 lines in Manhattan. It also created floodwaters up to a foot deep along parts of Broadway and Columbus Avenue, from West 61st Street into West 65th Street.

A lake of brown water lapped at the steps of Lincoln Center, and more than a half-million gallons flooded nearby subway tracks up to the rails.

605,2024-10-02,Sleeping Through Hurricane Helene,"Across the country, as many as six million more homes are at severe risk of flooding than are even included on the federal government’s flood risk maps, Michael Thomas pointed out in the aftermath of the storm. Across Asheville’s Buncombe County, 17 times as many homes had been judged at risk in a 100-year flood event as carried insurance against that risk; Helene was called a thousand-year flood for certain parts of the Southeast, though those terms grow less meaningful almost by the day. Another ostensible thousand-year storm had hit the coastal Carolinas just one week before. “Sometimes ‘worst case’ scenarios really do come to pass,” the climate scientist Daniel Swain wrote over the weekend on Sunday, “and I think we often lack the collective imagination to fully envision what that looks like.”

Americans watching disaster footage from a distance — collapsed bridges and disappeared roads, Asheville submerged by sludgy brown floodwater — wondered how hurricanes might produce such devastation, so far from shore and so high up in the mountains. They used the words “unprecedented” and “unthinkable” and grimly recalled silly rankings of so-called climate havens, often produced in partnership with real estate brokers, which named Asheville as a top choice destination for those seeking safety from extreme weather. In conversation and on social media they suggested, as they had with floods in Vermont and orange skies in New York last summer, that the lesson of Helene is that nowhere is safe from climate disaster; an essay bearing that headline, published in Politico, was presented by Chevron. The real lesson may not be quite so grim, though it also demands more of us: To the extent we might enjoy safety and stability in a world evermore pockmarked by climate impacts, it won’t be because we casually circled havens on maps but because we built and designed them ourselves.

Helene gives one vision of the future, with the storm scarring a whole region and imposing perhaps a decade of recovery. But in truth, as extraordinary as its devastation might seem, this kind of flooding in this kind of setting was not unthinkable or, for that matter, even unprecedented. Indeed, it happened in western North Carolina in 1916, and Hurricanes Camille (1969) and Agnes (1972) offered additional cautionary tales. For those with foreshortened memories, there was similarly spectacular flooding, nearly simultaneously, in Kathmandu, Nepal, on the other side of the planet, where nearly 150 have died and landslides have flattened whole neighborhoods after half a year’s rain fell in two days in a city twice as high up in the mountains and twice as far from the coast as Asheville.

These days, even ubiquitous news stories produce some amount of lamentation that nobody is covering this, since everyone loves to post media criticism and in an endless scroll it’s easy enough to find sufficient straw men. (We hear a lot about social media’s echo chamber, but its greatest trick is showing you stuff to get outraged about, including the apparent indifference or lack of interest of others.)

At first, over the weekend, word of Helene’s devastation crisscrossed the country almost by whisper, in part because the few in position to observe the greatest damage firsthand lacked cellular and internet connections with which to transmit their pictures and in part because national media hadn’t quite anticipated the scale of destruction and local media, though heroic, was only capable of so much.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.8553,"['Nepal', 'United States']","['New York', 'Asheville', 'Kathmandu']"
606,2023-10-04,Flood Threats Are Rising. Here’s Where People Are Moving Into Harm’s Way.,"Why It Matters: On a warmer planet, rainstorms are stronger.

Human-driven climate change is amplifying flood threats globally. Rising sea levels are leading to more destructive coastal storm surges. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, which means storms are primed to deliver more rain.

But in many countries, the more significant driver of flood exposure is increased building in unsafe places, said Jun Rentschler, a World Bank economist and lead author of the new study.

“Ideally, what we would like to see is that human settlements are avoiding these flood zones,” Dr. Rentschler said. “What we find is, on average globally, it’s the opposite that’s happening: Rather than gradually reducing exposure to flood hazards, many countries are rapidly increasing it.”

The reasons construction takes place despite the danger can be many, and Dr. Rentschler and his colleagues didn’t try to analyze which ones were most important in specific places. In some nations, the safest land might already be occupied, forcing new development to occur in hazardous areas that had once been avoided. Governments also want property-tax revenues. People want second homes. And waterfront living has long had a certain appeal.

Background: Satellite images reveal construction in flood zones.

In the study, which was published on Wednesday, the researchers analyzed decades of satellite data to see how the physical footprints of cities and towns changed worldwide between 1985 and 2015. They then compared this expansion with high-resolution maps of present-day flood exposure.

They found that, around the world, humans occupied about 56,000 square miles of flood-prone land in 2015, up from 26,000 three decades earlier. This growth was much faster than overall settlement expansion during that time.

The researchers defined flood-prone areas as ones that would be inundated by more than half a meter, or about a foot and a half, during flood events that have a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year.

The study didn’t account for flood defenses such as dikes, levees, dams and drainage systems. One reason, Dr. Rentschler said, is that there isn’t a good global inventory of such structures. Another is that, even in places with artificial flood protections, understanding the vulnerability can help policymakers develop early-warning systems, evacuation plans and emergency responses, and figure out what to do if their infrastructure gives out.

“When we have big disasters, it’s often because those defenses fail,” said Stéphane Hallegatte, a senior climate change adviser at the World Bank and another author of the study. He pointed to the catastrophic recent floods in Libya, where torrential rains caused two aging dams to burst, killing at least 4,000 people and displacing 43,000.

“We have been working quite a lot with countries, making sure when they build infrastructure, they don’t assume the job is done because the risk is gone,” Dr. Hallegatte said.

What’s Next: Monitoring flood-prone development in real time.

Dr. Rentschler said he hoped that this kind of data could someday help inform government policies by tracking economic development that exposes people and structures to greater flood risk.

“Often it can be convenient to think of climate change as an exogenous force that’s beyond the influence and power of local authorities,” Dr. Rentschler said. And yet, it’s state, county and city officials who approve new developments and enforce zoning regulations, he said. “What this study really shows is that, in terms of exposure and people’s vulnerability, the action really is local.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,0.9418,['Libya'],[]

Flood insurance is a crucial piece of the complex puzzle that many home buyers need to secure before sealing a real estate deal. Without it, they cannot easily get a home loan. Regulators require lenders offering mortgages for homes in “special flood hazard areas” to ensure that flood insurance policies are in place for them. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled entities that back the bulk of U.S. mortgages, require it for homes in those areas, too.

But as climate change makes weather events more extreme and less predictable, and as growing cities leave less room for water to safely drain away, flood insurance is harder to get. As a backstop, Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program, which is run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Without the program, some homeowners could struggle to keep their houses insured. And any claims made by policyholders would be paid only until FEMA’s funds ran out.

Government officials are aware of the problem and are trying to soften its effects. Federal regulators, along with Fannie and Freddie, will suspend their flood insurance requirements if the government shuts down, the National Association of Realtors said on its website. That means banks and other mortgage lenders would have to decide whether to force home buyers to have it, according to the real estate trade group. For a short time, buyers and sellers could also help each other by transferring existing policies from seller to buyer to prevent a sale from falling through.

The dayslong rain was reminiscent of weather around this same time in 2017 and in 2019 but brought more destruction, washing away bridges, leaving gaping holes in roadways, and sweeping homes and shacks from their foundations.

Residents and community leaders recalled promises made by local officials to improve drainage systems, strengthen roadways, and move shack settlers into more stable housing and away from flood-prone areas.

The passengers crowded forward as the water rose, submerging the cars at the rear first because they were deeper in the tunnel.

As the water reached their waists, then chests, finally their necks, the passengers called emergency services or relatives. One gave her parents the details for accessing her bank account. Some cried. Others retched or fainted. After two hours, it became difficult to breathe in the congested air that remained in the cars.

Ding Xiaopei, a radio host, was afraid to call her children, 13 and 4. What could she say? She posted a video that she thought might be her last message. “The water outside has reached this position,” she said, it having reached chest level, “and my mobile phone will soon run out of power.”

622,2024-10-02,The People Fleeing Climate Disasters Are Going to Transform the American South,"One study by the First Street Foundation, a research firm that studies climate threats to housing, found that roughly 3.2 million Americans have already migrated, many over short distances, out of flood zones, such as low-lying parts of Staten Island, Miami and Galveston, Texas. Over the next 30 years, 7.5 million more are projected to leave those perennially flooded zones, according to the study.

All of this suggests a possible boom for inland and Northern cities. But it also will leave behind large swaths of coastal and other vulnerable land where older adults and the poor are very likely to disproportionately remain.

The Southern United States stands to be especially transformed. Extreme heat, storms and coastal flooding will weigh heavily on the bottom third of this country, making the environment less comfortable and life within it more expensive and less prosperous.

The young, mobile and middle class will be more likely to leave to chase opportunity and physical and economic safety. That means government — from local to federal — must now recognize its responsibility to support the communities in climate migration’s wake. Even as an aging population left behind will require greater services, medical attention and physical accommodation, the residents that remain will reside in states that may also face diminished representation in Congress, because their communities are shrinking. Local governments could be left to fend alone, but with an evaporating tax base to work with.

In December, the First Street Foundation created one of the first clear pictures of how this demographic change is unfolding. It looked at flood risk and migration patterns down to the census tract, across the country, and identified hundreds of thousands of so-called abandonment zones where the out-migration of residents in response to rising risk had already passed a tipping point, and people were making small, local moves to higher ground.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,0.9105,['United States'],"['Staten Island', 'Miami', 'Texas', 'Galveston']"

This is a much higher estimate of flood exposure in Los Angeles than the one produced by the federal government. That estimate classifies areas of the city containing about 23,000 residents as being at high risk in a 100-year event, or an event with a 1 percent chance of occurring in any year.

Many of Los Angeles’s flood control channels have become clogged with sediment and vegetation, reducing the amount of water they can transport, Dr. Sanders said.

During hurricanes Henri and Ida, I was bucketing water away from the door, which leads to my bedroom. I bought a raised drain guard and a sump pump that hooks up to a garden hose, but the pump couldn’t keep up. Because I was home, the damage was limited. But what if a big storm hits when I’m not home? The management company told me to deduct the cost of the pump from the rent. But shouldn’t the landlord address the larger drainage issues?

A: Your landlord is essentially treating you like an employee of the building by relying on you to constantly keep the water out. You cannot be expected to rush home from dinner, work or vacation for every nor’easter or heavy summer storm.

Maintaining the property — and that includes making sure water drains properly — is the landlord’s responsibility, not yours.

636,2022-09-07,Pakistan’s Vulnerability to Disaster Was Through the Roof. Then Came the Floods.,"Sometimes a weather event is so extreme and so far-reaching, it can be hard to make sense of, particularly from a distance. A third of Pakistan has been submerged by flooding now for at least a week, leading to image after image and video after video of endless water where homes and roads were meant to be. More than a thousand people have died, with more than a million houses destroyed or damaged. More than 100 bridges have collapsed, and thousands of miles of roads have been damaged. Hundreds of thousands of farm animals have died, and as many as 73,000 women are expected to give birth over the next month without adequate medical support.

Almost certainly, the monsoon rains were made worse by climate change, in part because rapidly melting glaciers contributed, and soon after the most striking images began to circulate internationally, there were calls for climate reparations, with which the world’s rich would compensate the world’s poor for the ravages of warming. (Among those making that call was Pakistan’s outspoken climate minister, Sherry Rehman.) Others argued that flooding of this scale, in a country only very fractionally responsible for global warming, made clear the need for a loss-and-damage system — which is what climate advocates say is a more circumscribed approach to help channel support from the rich countries of the world to those suffering most from climate impacts.

But as with any disaster, climate alone does not tell the whole story, and as the flooding wore on, blame has been spread around more widely. In the Pakistani English-language newspaper Dawn, the columnist Arifa Noor outlined many of the country’s policy and preparation failures in the decade since devastating 2010 floods that killed almost 2,000 Pakistanis, caused billions of dollars in damage and at the time were “the worst natural disaster to date attributable to climate change,” according to ClimateWire. Now “Pakistan has been hit by another calamity, but this time around nature has been even more wrathful,” Noor wrote. “The problem is that climate change is also turning into an excuse,” she went on, adding that “the rains and their intensity are beyond our control; the havoc they wreak is not.”

As the flooding continued, Foreign Policy declared that “bad governance exacerbated Pakistan’s flooding,” listing some long-term mistakes: failing water infrastructure, deforestation, poor drainage systems and dangerous, unregulated construction. But there are immediate needs, as well, of course. “Pakistan is at its nadir of political stability,” the climate scientist Fahad Saeed of Climate Analytics wrote last week, citing the ouster, by a messy 13-party coalition, of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf national government, and the fact that the P.T.I. remains in power at the provincial level. “In a recently called all-parties conference, P.T.I. was not even invited,” he wrote, “a reflection of the political bitterness, even during the time of worst flooding of country’s history.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,1,0,1,-0.9981,['Pakistan'],[]

“It’s unprecedented for three to four inches of rain per hour to fall for three straight hours,” Ms. Hurley said.

Flooding is a result of both heavy rainfall and of the way water is managed — through dams, levees or retention ponds — as well as the local hydrology, or the way that water flows, collects and runs off the land.

The catastrophic flash floods triggered by heavy rainfall caught many by surprise in Waverly last weekend. Brandon Dill for The New York Times

Much of the rain that fell near McEwen flowed down to Waverly, a community of 4,100 people that sits several hundred feet lower. There, entire neighborhoods were washed away by the floodwaters.

Ms. Hurley explained that the water had been funneled into Trace Creek, which runs downstream through Waverly.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,news analysis,0,0,0,-0.9231,[],"['Nashville', 'Much', 'Waverly']"
645,2023-07-10,Officials say the flooding is the worst since Hurricane Irene.,"The flash floods across New England, New York and Quebec on Monday evoked frequent comparisons to Hurricane Irene, which inundated the region in 2011 after making landfall and being downgraded to a tropical storm. Irene killed at least 40 people in 11 states and caused more than $6.5 billion in damage.

Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont said he feared that the sheer volume of water dumped on his state by this week’s storm system could surpass the amount that fell during Irene, because the region will be pummeled by rain for several days.

“What’s different for me is that Irene lasted about 24 hours,” he said at a news conference on Monday morning. “We’re getting just as much rain, if not more, and it’s going on for days. That’s my concern. It’s not just the initial damage.”

The Winooski River running through Vermont’s capital of Montpelier is expected to crest on Tuesday at its second-highest level ever, at 19.8 feet. That’s almost a foot higher than the river reached after Tropical Storm Irene in 2011. The record-high crest — of over 27 feet — occurred during Vermont’s “greatest natural disaster,” the floods of November 1927, according to the National Weather Service.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,1,0,1,-0.8934,[],['New York']

At least 21 people were confirmed dead and about 10 others remained missing, officials said, in catastrophic flash flooding that climate scientists warned will become only more common.

Image Lilly Bryant, 15, is missing following the flooding in Waverly, Tenn.

“This is exactly the type of event we expect to see with increasing frequency in a warming climate,” said Gary Lackmann, a professor of atmospheric science at North Carolina State University.

The Tennessee disaster came just days after at least five people were killed in flash floods in North Carolina in the wake of Tropical Storm Fred. In July, extraordinary floods in Germany sent water crashing through the streets, killing dozens and causing widespread devastation.

Some scientists caution, however, that it can be difficult to determine whether climate change is the driving force behind any individual flood or is responsible for making it more catastrophic, including in Tennessee. Flooding is a result both of heavy rainfall and of the way water is managed — through dams, levees or retention ponds — as well as a landscape’s hydrology, the way that water flows, collects and runs off the land.

To perform an attribution, scientists use mathematical models to analyze both the world as it is and the world as it might have been, had humans not spent decades pumping planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. With computer simulations, they can replay recent history dozens, even hundreds, of times in both worlds to see how often the event, and others like it, occur in each. The differences indicate how much global warming was likely responsible.

Researchers often perform this comparison using scores of climate models to ensure their conclusions are sound. They also check the simulations against records of actual events that have occurred in the past.

To examine this year’s flooding in Pakistan, the authors of the new study looked at two metrics: the maximum 60-day rainfall each year between June and September over the entire Indus River Basin, and the maximum five-day rainfall each year over the badly hit southern provinces of Sindh and Baluchistan.

The researchers found that several of their models did not realistically reproduce patterns in the actual rainfall data for Pakistan.

The sudden increase in levels at the Kakhovka reservoir appears in altimetry data — which uses satellites to measure height — published on Friday by Theia, a French earth data provider.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service has not recorded water levels that high at the dam since at least 1992, when the service began publishing data. Russian forces control the dam and the nearby power plant, which are vital to managing water levels in the reservoir.

A New York Times analysis of satellite imagery over a period of several months also showed that the water level has risen significantly, and now covers sandbars that line the waterway. In recent days, the reservoir has reached more concerning levels, appearing to actually crest over the top of the dam.

The development is a dramatic turnabout, coming only a few months after water levels in the reservoir had reached a historic low. At the time, Ukrainian officials raised concerns about a lack of water for drinking, agriculture and the cooling of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant nearby.

But this study and others show that climate disasters “are not something for the future, they’re happening today,” he said. “So we do need those solutions on loss and damage and we need particularly to deliver in those countries where that vulnerability is highest.”

The analysis looked at two aspects of the seasonal rains in the region this year: average rainfall for the entire season over a large drainage area, mostly in Chad, and spikes of extreme rainfall over weeklong periods in another drainage area, mostly in Nigeria.

Like similar studies by this and other groups, the researchers used observational data as well as climate models that simulate both the current world, where emissions of greenhouse gases since the 19th century have raised temperatures by about 1.1 degree Celsius, or 2 degrees Fahrenheit, and a hypothetical world where no emissions, and thus no warming, occurred. This study has yet to be peer-reviewed and published in a journal, but the techniques used have been peer-reviewed many times before.

Comparing results from the two models, the researchers were able to determine the influence of climate change on the rains. That influence appeared to be greater on the overall season, where climate change made such a high average rainfall 80 times more likely. Climate change made the heavy short-duration rains only twice as likely, the researchers found.

Floods are not uncommon in the rainy season is West Africa, but these were the worst in decades in Nigeria and some of the other countries.

685,2020-09-04,Americans Back Tough Limits on Building in Fire and Flood Zones,"As global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, decisions about where and how to build have become increasingly important. If local governments continue to allow homes to go up in places most exposed to climate change, such as coastlines, floodplains or fire-prone wilderness, experts say, it will make generations of current and future residents more vulnerable to worsening hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters.

Yet those long-term concerns have typically been outweighed by the demand for new homes, and the jobs and tax revenue that come with them. In many coastal states, the most flood-prone areas have seen the highest rates of home construction since 2010, a study last year found. And in California and elsewhere, officials continue to approve development in areas hit by fires.

“Some of the most vulnerable land also ends up being some of the highest-priced land,” said Otis Rolley, senior vice president at the Rockefeller Foundation and former North America managing director for 100 Resilient Cities, an initiative that worked with cities to better withstand shocks from climate change and other challenges. “There’s a lot of pressure on elected officials.”

A wave of disasters has pushed some cities and counties to limit where they build.

686,2025-03-06,How to Prevent Frozen Pipes From Flooding Your House,"Chances are, you can stop reading this article right here. If you follow the steps above, and all the plumbing in your home runs through interior walls or up through the floors, and your home is reasonably well weatherized, “the risk of frozen pipes is very low,” Abrams says.

That’s true even in chilly parts of the country, where temperatures can stay below freezing for days or weeks at a time. In a 2014 interview with The New York Times, building scientist William B. Rose noted that homes in cold climates are generally built such that the plumbing has good protection from cold temperatures. On the other hand, “Southern plumbers have been much more careless about that,” Rose said.

That difference shows in the insurance data: State Farm regularly publishes a list of the 10 states where it has covered the greatest losses from frozen pipes. In many years, warm-weather states dominate the rankings.

During the winter of 2020–21, for example, State Farm covered a staggering $343 million in losses in Texas alone (roughly 17 times as much as the next most-affected state, chilly Illinois). Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Louisiana also made State Farm’s top 10 that winter. Texas again topped the list the following winter. And the winter after that, Georgia took the lead, while Tennessee and Texas again found their way into the top five.

Kohlbecker says that Country Financial has observed similar claims patterns across the states where it does business, with Georgia and Alabama sitting in its top five for frozen-pipe claims over the past three years.

Regardless of where you live, your home is at a much higher risk for frozen pipes if any of your plumbing runs through areas with little heat and poor insulation—and therefore has more exposure to low temperatures. Common weak points include:

Exterior walls: Kohlbecker says that this is one of the most common scenarios that lead to frozen plumbing, even in brand-new homes. “Pipes on the north side of the home are more susceptible to freezing,” he says, because they get the least sun exposure.

Kohlbecker says that this is one of the most common scenarios that lead to frozen plumbing, even in brand-new homes. “Pipes on the north side of the home are more susceptible to freezing,” he says, because they get the least sun exposure. Unconditioned attics, crawl spaces, or garages: “If the pipes aren’t properly insulated, extreme cold events will cause those pipes to freeze and burst,” Abrams says. It’s more common to find plumbing in these uninsulated spaces in warmer parts of the country, where homes aren’t always built with freezing temperatures in mind.

If your plumbing does run through any of those risky areas, the most permanent fix is to improve your weatherization. That means adding insulation to your home—or at least around the water lines themselves—and sealing any air gaps to reduce the pipes’ exposure to freezing temperatures.

But those steps aren’t always affordable or practical, especially if you’re facing a cold snap on short notice, so you might consider the following workarounds:

Let your faucets drip: This practice dramatically reduces the risk of a burst, even for high-risk pipes. (Just confirm first that your utility company allows it.) Open both the hot and cold taps, or go straight up the middle on a one-handle system, just enough so that the water comes out at a trickle. Conventional wisdom says that moving water takes longer to freeze, and there’s some truth to that. But as Rose explained to The New York Times, the open faucet actually works as a relief valve for the pressure that builds up inside a pipe as the water freezes and expands.

Conventional wisdom says that moving water takes longer to freeze, and there’s some truth to that. But as Rose explained to The New York Times, the open faucet actually works as a relief valve for the pressure that builds up inside a pipe as the water freezes and expands. Open your under-sink cabinets and the dishwasher door. Doing so helps heat circulate around your pipes and drain traps. If you’re already dripping your faucets, they’re unlikely to burst. But this is an easy additional step you can take to help spare yourself the inconvenience of a frozen drain line.

Doing so helps heat circulate around your pipes and drain traps. If you’re already dripping your faucets, they’re unlikely to burst. But this is an easy additional step you can take to help spare yourself the inconvenience of a frozen drain line. Use a space heater or heat tape for at-risk areas. Even a weak space heater can prevent nearby pipes from freezing; just be sure to follow space-heater safety advice. For vulnerable supply lines in a cold crawl space or attic, heat tape is an affordable, widely available option. (The Times actually published a how-to article on heat-tape installation back in 1980.) After you wrap it around your at-risk pipes (or hire a handyman to do that) and plug it into a standard outlet, the tape applies gentle heat across its length. Some heat tapes work with a thermostat so that they warm up only when necessary.

If your pipes have already frozen, experts recommend opening your faucets to relieve air pressure, shutting off the water main to your house to prevent uncontrolled flooding if your pipes have cracked, and warming up any frozen stretches of plumbing that you can find with a hair dryer, space heater, or heat tape.

Once the water starts flowing again, keep an eye out for leaks. Generally, insurance will cover cleanup and repairs as long as your heat was on, Kohlbecker says. Take photos and file a claim as soon as possible. Consider hiring a professional water-damage restoration company to clean and dry the affected area, especially if pipes leaked inside a wall or through the ceiling. Although insurance typically covers water damage, it usually doesn’t cover mold remediation, so preventing mold from growing in the first place is important.

Again, there’s no need to panic: As long as you take a few easy steps to prepare your plumbing for freezing temperatures, you shouldn’t have any problems with pipe bursts.

693,2022-10-27,Everything I Did to Flood-Proof My Old House,"If you ask five different contractors how to protect your home from flooding, you’ll get five different opinions and five widely varying estimates. The purpose of this exercise is to help you fully understand your needs, gain a complete picture, compare different solutions, and make an educated decision. It will also help protect you from getting fleeced.

After Hurricane Ida, my contractor friend Richard Taglieri suggested I install a backflow valve, a device that prevents sewage and stormwater from the outside backing up into your basement. Also known as a backflow preventer or check valve, it senses when water is flowing in the wrong direction and seals off your drains with an internal flap.

Illustration: Dana Davis

Our backflow valve was relatively inexpensive and required minimal excavation. Two sewer contractors dug up about 6 square feet of floor in the front of the basement to gain access to the pipes and insert the backflow valve. The valve should be installed in a pipe that comes before all of your basement cleanouts. That way, any incoming water gets blocked before it reaches your drain.

One of the valve’s disadvantages is that you can’t use appliances during major storms because the flap will close, causing wastewater to be trapped inside and then overflow in your home. But that’s a small price to pay for this increased level of protection, and it’s a good excuse to get out of doing laundry.

The contractors also wisely exchanged our old-school cleanout plugs with extra-tight expansion plugs. Unlike the leaky old plugs that had to be hammered back in anytime they were removed, the new plugs have a screw on the top that makes them expand and contract when the screw is twisted, allowing for a tighter seal.

What works for me (a relatively inexpensive improvement with compromises) might not work for you. Each house presents a unique situation with a unique maze of pipes, traps, and drains. Our neighbors across the street had a pump in front of their basement door and got three times as much water in their basement during Ida as we did; the no-pump neighbors next door got almost twice as much.

Our backflow valve worked great at keeping sewer overflow from flooding our house. But the rain barrels, which helped keep rainwater out of our internal sewers and reduced puddles in the yard, could only do so much.

When a big storm rolls in and dumps several inches of rain in just a few hours, our backyard still turns into a lake, especially when the ground is already soaked from several days of rain. At one such point in 2023, water started sneaking through tiny holes in the back wall and around the bottom of the door. It wasn’t a disaster, but it was the last straw for us.

Each house presents a unique situation with a unique maze of pipes, traps, and drains.

Experts had been telling us for ages to install a French drain to catch any water before it could flood our basement—whether due to sewer backups, broken pipes, the groundwater rising, or saturated soil. A French drain also relieves hydrostatic pressure which can harm a home’s foundation.

We had been hesitant because installing a French drain is pricey and involves a lot of noise, digging, and dust, but we finally hit our breaking point.

So, one morning, the plumbers got to work hammering out a basin as well as a foot-wide trench around the basement. They added a perforated pipe to the trench to collect the water and filled it with gravel.

When heavy storms hit, the trench and pipe fill up with water, which gets funneled into the basin where a pump diverts it through a PVC pipe out onto the street. The construction took just under three days, but at around $10,000, the French drain wasn’t cheap.

But compared to the losses we experienced during Hurricane Ida, it was a bargain.

After Ida, we spent $20,000 for home repairs and replacements, and Giovanni’s gallery estimates the loss of his paintings at around $150,000. FEMA had granted us a measly $3,167.80 in disaster relief.

Instead of engaging in a should-have-could-have game, I reminded myself that things could have been much worse and that, along the way, we have done everything within our power and budget—and we’ve learned a ton: After the basement toilet turned into a geyser during Hurricane Sandy, we had the funky basement bathroom removed . I had cellar doors installed to protect the back entrance. I had contractors raise the basement wall outlets 3 feet off the ground to keep us from being electrocuted when wading through water. I had an enclosed, up-to-code boiler room built, with the new furnace placed on cinder blocks to prevent, or at least minimize, water damage. We get our sewer lines snaked twice a year so that built-up debris doesn’t cause additional backup. And we have added backup insurance to our homeowner’s policy, which was much cheaper than we had expected. (Make sure to inform your insurance agent of your exact problem, to determine whether you need flood or backup insurance or both.) Moreover, buying a smart water-leak protector, with add-on sensors that can detect any kind of water anywhere in the house, will alert you to any water leakage the moment it begins.

If dampness and frequent flooding are an issue, a good dehumidifier is indispensable. While our basement isn’t dank in general, after heavy rains we make use of the Midea 50 Pint Cube, Wirecutter’s top pick dehumidifier. It works efficiently, drying out the basement overnight, and it looks inoffensive—stylish almost. On little wheels, it slides from outlet to drain with ease. It can be drained through a hose directly into a floor drain, saving you from straining your back when lifting it to empty it into a sink.

Outdoors, a rain garden can be a potentially self-sustaining solution that can help keep water away from your foundation. A rain garden is essentially a dedicated area that’s designed with plants that soak up rainwater and can withstand standing water as well as droughts. It can also attract bees and butterflies.

Depending on your needs and energy, a rain garden can be a small project based on your existing surroundings or a multiday endeavor. Ideally, you should dig out a basin in your yard that’s at least 6 to 8 inches deep. Your rain garden should be close to your home’s downspout but at least 10 feet downslope from the foundation. Once you’ve installed piping that carries water from your downspout(s) into the basin, fill the area with different layers of soil and stones. And add plants that can tolerate wet and dry growing conditions and that are suitable for your yard’s sun or shade exposure.

Creating a rain garden is a potentially self-sustaining solution that can help keep water away from your foundation.

In my case, it was enough to ameliorate our packed soil with lots of compost and have our downspout empty into a bed of ferns (chosen for their absorbency and low maintenance), flowering stonecrop, and clover (my pet rabbits love nibbling on the latter).

My late rabbit, Spooky, is seen here munching on clover. Photo: Sabine Heinlein

In addition to my starter rain garden, I have several large metal planters. I placed them on the shady paved perimeters, close to the foundation, to soak up rainwater that might otherwise find its way to the foundation—despite my best efforts to divert it. The planters are attractive and easy to put together. And they don’t require me to bend down to sow and weed, so they’re great for certain people with limited mobility. I love how sturdy and spacious these planters are: I can grow ample amounts of spinach and arugula in the spring and fall, and basil in the summer.

If you see debris piling up in your street’s drain, be a good neighbor and clear it out. Photo: Sabine Heinlein

I’ve put a lot of work into my own home, but I also believe that it’s important to advocate for myself and my community on a larger scale. Honoring my role as the squeakiest wheel on the block, I have contacted the Department of Environmental Protection and my council members more times than I can count. For years, I’ve begged for our block’s catch basins to be cleaned out on a regular schedule and for the sewer system to be expanded to handle the combined stormwater and wastewater. Both the DEP and my councilwoman admit that our old sewer system wasn’t designed to manage the kind of storms we’ve been seeing as of late. I was also told by my councilwoman’s community liaison that the DEP has plans to revamp the system but that it would take time. There’s still no actual plan of action that I’m aware of.

In the meantime, we homeowners and tenants have to continue bothering our officials to support new infrastructure and to protect ourselves with home upgrades. Also, it never hurts to own a good pair of rubber boots.

Now, at least 10 communities in Guatemala remain flooded, and with Iota on the way, there is a “high possibility” of landslides, falling rock, mudslides and road closures, the country’s meteorological agency said on Tuesday.

In San Pedro Sula, Honduras’ second-largest city, battered by Hurricane Eta just weeks ago, videos on social media showed streets turned into rivers after hours of heavy rain.

The threat of flooding and landslides loomed across the region.

In Colombia, the storm’s first death was reported on the island of Providencia, where Hurricane Iota struck as a catastrophic Category 5 overnight before weakening as it approached Nicaragua.

Nicaragua reported two deaths linked to Hurricane Iota on Tuesday afternoon. The country’s vice president said that two children had drowned in the La Solera river, near the Pacific Coast.

Iota made landfall in northeastern Nicaragua at 10:40 p.m. Eastern time Monday as a Category 4 storm, with wind speeds up to about 155 miles per hour, according to the hurricane center.

This is the third storm since Ian to cause damage along Florida’s southwest Gulf Coast, said Mayor Dan Allers of Fort Myers Beach, and each one hampers recovery. Helene, he said, created as much mess as Hurricanes Debby and Idalia, which hit this August and last August, combined. Storm surge was recorded at about six feet, and it deposited sand mounds as high as three feet along Estero Boulevard, the main road spanning the seven-mile island.

City crews planned to spend the next several days clearing roads. A Hurricane Ian “Remembrance and Resiliency Ceremony” that was scheduled for Saturday was canceled as the town once again focuses on recovery. Mr. Allers said he’s also looking into sewage problems, which residents from two areas of the island had reported.

“It feels like whenever you start making good momentum, you’re pushed backward,” he lamented. Even so, he said, the damage was nowhere near that from Hurricane Ian, which swept homes and businesses out to sea.

There were no evacuation orders issued in Lee County, as the predicted surge was not life-threatening. Still, Ms. Weber said many of her neighbors left out of precaution, the harrowing memories of drownings still fresh.

It could rain for days in Southern California starting on Saturday afternoon, potentially in record amounts, creating the risk of what the National Weather Service described as “life-threatening flooding” Sunday into Monday.

The storm system is also expected to bring several feet of snow to the Sierra Nevada, and powerful onshore winds and intense, damaging surf along the California coast.

Here is what to know.

The effects of this system will begin to be felt in California on Saturday afternoon, and will last through Tuesday.

The heaviest rainfall is likely south of the Bay Area, and excessive rainfall is most likely from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles.

There could be dangerous flash flooding in places. The Weather Service warned that, starting on Sunday, the Los Angeles River “will fill quickly and become a raging river and a very dangerous place to be.”

There is an extremely high chance — over 90 percent — of at least two feet of snow, especially above 6,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada, causing difficult to impossible driving conditions Sunday and Monday.

This atmospheric river will be stronger than the last two.

This storm will connect to an atmospheric river, a stream of moisture in the sky that is typically a couple of hundred miles wide and can be seen on satellite imagery.

Meteorologists warned that the slower speed means the hurricane is dumping larger amounts of rain along its path, causing what is expected to be record flooding in western and southwestern parts of the state. Rivers, streams and creeks inland will be overrun, but unable to drain out to sea because of the storm surge that has inundated coastal areas, they said.

“This has been such a large area of heavy rainfall,” said Ross Giarratana, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Tampa Bay Area office. “That hits a lot of river basins and causes a lot of extra runoff that ends up needing to pass through the river system, but it can’t because they’re overflowing.”

Large parts of the state will be feeling the impacts of the flooding for days and possibly up to a week, Mr. Giarratana said. Florida’s flat terrain will also make the rivers slower to drain, he added.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,0,-0.7615,[],['Florida']

Showers that began on Sunday have allowed firefighters to roughly double the containment of the 76,000-acre fire, which erupted west of Lake Tahoe during a record-breaking heat wave.

Now for the bad news: The storms have raised the risk of flash floods in the sheer, muddy hills damaged by fire. Weather officials have warned that people who live near the Mosquito burn scar should watch for flooding through the end of the day.

“You have some areas where the vegetation is completely burned away off the side of a hill,” Scott McLean, a Cal Fire spokesman, said. “You get this moisture coming down, it’s going to loosen up that soil, because there’s nothing to hold the soil in place.”

This one-two punch from Mother Nature has become a familiar story in California. This month, a tropical storm hit Riverside County in the midst of the enormous Fairview fire (now almost entirely contained), bringing the possibility of mudslides.

The couple and their four children who live with them had prepared for the storm, putting up water barriers and buying two paddle boards that they could perhaps use to evacuate in a worst-case scenario.

On Thursday night, as the storm first approached, it was eerily quiet. Then, suddenly, the water began to rise — two feet in an hour. They feared it would rise to the roof, and made a decision to swim out to safety.

Outside, the water was chest-high, dark and moving fast. A few times, they both thought they would die.

725,2022-05-13,"Did Warming Play a Role in Deadly South African Floods? Yes, a Study Says.","This includes using observational data and two sets of computer simulations, one that models the world as it is, about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) warmer than it was before widespread emissions began in the late 19th century, and a hypothetical world in which global warming never happened.

The finding that the likelihood of such an extreme rain event has increased with global warming is consistent with many other studies of individual events and broader trends. A major reason for the increase is that as the atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture.

The study noted that from a meteorological perspective, a storm that has a 1-in-20 chance of occurring in any given year, while not common, is hardly a rare event. So the researchers looked at other factors that could have contributed to the disaster’s high toll in deaths and damage.

Among these, they wrote, were legacies of policies instituted during the apartheid era. In 1958, for example, the Durban City Council adopted a measure that forced nonwhites into less desirable and, in many cases, more flood-prone, areas.

The researchers also cited the rise of makeshift settlements as a result of rapid urban growth and a lack of affordable housing. About 22 percent of Durban’s population, or 800,000 people, live in such settlements, which usually lack services and proper infrastructure. In the April flooding, the study noted, about 4,000 of the 13,500 houses that were damaged or destroyed were along riverbanks in these types of settlements, and most of the deaths were in these areas as well.

Stricken by the thought of being trapped (or worse) in my house by falling trees, I decided to drive to Greenville, S.C., with my elderly cat, but not without extreme anxiety.

Videos on social media showed pedestrian bridges being washed away and foamy white water rising along the river banks in the city, in southern Ukraine, where Kyiv’s forces are carrying out a counteroffensive. Residents said that a large dam was hit on the Inhulets River, a strategic waterway, and many were worried about flooding.

743,2024-09-26,What Does a Hurricane’s Category Tell Us?,"When a hurricane threatens land, one of the top questions on people’s minds is what category is it, and that’s for good reason. Hurricanes are categorized by their wind speeds on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, which provides useful information on the storm’s winds, their expected impact and potential damage.

Hurricane Helene was nearing the coast of Florida as a Category 3 storm on Thursday evening and was expected to make landfall as a Category 4.

Hurricanes are split into five categories based on the wind speeds they generate:

Category 1: winds between 74 miles per hour and 95 m.p.h. These are considered “very dangerous winds” that will cause some damage, even tearing the roofs of “well-constructed frame homes,” and taking shingles, vinyl siding and gutters, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Category 2: winds between 96 m.p.h. and 110 m.p.h. Hurricanes at this level carry “extremely dangerous winds” that will cause vast damage, including major damage to roofs and siding and uprooting trees. A near-total loss of power is expected.

Category 3: winds between 111 m.p.h. and 129 m.p.h. This is the level at which a hurricane is considered “major,” according to the Hurricane Center, and its wind speeds indicate that “devastating damage will occur.” Homes might see major damage, such as the removal of roof decking and gable ends. Snapped or uprooted trees might block roads, while electricity and water will likely be unavailable for days or even weeks.

Category 4: winds between 130 m.p.h. and 156 m.p.h. Catastrophic damage is expected, with homes sustaining severe damage that can include losing their roofs and some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles will be downed, causing residential areas to become isolated, according to the Hurricane Center. Power outages are expected to last weeks or even months, and most of the area will be uninhabitable for that period.

Category 5: winds of 157 m.p.h. and greater. At this point, “a high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse,” according to the Hurricane Center. There will be fallen trees and downed power poles, isolating residential areas with power outages lasting for weeks or months. As with a Category 4, most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.

Running from San Diego to San Luis Obispo, the oceanside tracks sitting atop coastal bluffs face erosion from higher water levels in the Pacific and record rainfall. In addition, increased precipitation has destabilized terrain on the inland side, leading to landslides — like two in San Clemente recently — that have led to rail closures.

“The vulnerabilities are substantial and only getting worse” she said, affecting “riders who take the train, freight that is transported on this section and even our military readiness,” because the corridor is part of Stracnet, the acronym for the Strategic Rail Corridor Network.

The states of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania have all experienced flash flooding over the past week, as torrential rain fell onto already saturated land, causing rivers to swell and overflow. Because of those conditions, flooding will continue to remain a risk for weeks, with even moderate rainfall posing a threat, the authorities said.

748,2023-01-20,What Will ‘Weather Whiplash’ Mean for California?,"California is built upon the great gamble of irrigation. Left alone, much of the land in the Western United States would be inhospitable to teeming cities. But we’re Americans — we couldn’t let the desert stand in our way.

More than a century ago, the United States Bureau of Land Reclamation began taming the water in the West. It’s been a remarkably successful project. In California, where I live, irrigation has turned largely barren regions into some the country’s most fertile farmland and most prosperous metropolises. We’ve built “the most ambitious desert civilization the world has seen,” Marc Reisner put it in “Cadillac Desert,” his 1986 history of Western irrigation.

I’ve been thinking a lot about “Cadillac Desert” in the past few weeks, as the rain fell and fell and kept falling over California, much of which, despite the pouring heavens, seems likely to remain in the grip of a severe drought. Reisner anticipated this moment. He worried that the West’s success with irrigation could be a mirage — that it took water for granted and didn’t appreciate the precariousness of our capacity to control it.

“Everything depends on the manipulation of water — on capturing it behind dams, storing it, and rerouting it in concrete rivers over distances of hundreds of miles,” he wrote. “Were it not for a century and a half of messianic effort toward that end, the West as we know it would not exist.”",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,0.9712,['United States'],[]

753,2023-05-31,"First Drought, Then Flood. Can the West Learn to Live Between Extremes?","Since New Year’s, storm after storm had pummeled the state, dropping epic quantities of water and snow. The water made its way toward the bottom of the valley, as it always had, coursing through waterways held in by earthen levees that, during drought years, grew desiccated and weak, pocked with squirrel burrows. In some parts of the valley bottom, the water wasn’t really contained at all. Deanna Jackson, the executive director of the local agency that manages groundwater in the Tulare Lake Hydrologic Region, described the flooding to me as “vagrant flows, wild flows,” nearly unmanageable water sheeting across the landscape. Houses and farms and dairies flooded, and people were using excavators to hastily build earthen dikes around their properties. Some of these, around houses and small dairies, were a few feet tall; others, around the lands of the largest and richest agriculture companies, were towering and miles-long. Sometimes these fortifications enraged neighbors, whose land the water found instead. In a valley where powerful interests had long jockeyed for access to water, the arguments were now about who would bear the flood.

A few days before, a canal wall along a train track just north of Allensworth, visible from Gonzales’s yard, began to crumble. A froth of brown storm water started to spread toward the houses. Neighbors grabbed shovels and came running; Gonzales and his son brought over the tractors that Gonzales usually uses to muck out paddocks. When they ran out of sandbags, their neighbor Ruben Guerrero, who rushed from work at a nearby elementary school to join the emergency response, had an idea: to fortify the canal wall with the help of a roll of sheet plastic he was planning to use for a house-painting project. The men finally forced the water back with a fix that was part berm, part sand burrito. As the flood pulse receded, they celebrated their victory. But it turned out to be another case of competing interests: The railroad company that owned the land dismantled their work, saying that by protecting their houses, they had threatened the company’s property. So hour by hour, they patrolled the levee, watching the water flow through, quick and deep.

Shortly after, another alert went through town: A different levee, this one along Deer Creek, had given way. Floodwater was again flowing toward Allensworth. First, though, the water surged into a pistachio orchard, where it threatened to uproot trees and drown them in sediment. A video that later went viral captured the farmer’s response: He drove two pickup trucks to the top of the levee, filled their beds with soil to weigh them down and then revved the engines and propelled the trucks straight into the flooded breach where the levee wall used to be. (One, fittingly, was a Chevy.) Heavy equipment and helicopter loads of sandbags from Cal Fire completed the job, but rumors swirled about why the breach had occurred. Jack Mitchell, the head of the local flood-control district, reported that it looked as if a cut had been made with machinery. Had someone intentionally cut the levee, jeopardizing Allensworth, not to mention someone else’s farm, to save his own? “I can’t see how a tree, or a product, a vegetable, is more important than a life,” Guerrero said, shaking his head. “Tomatoes are not the only ones that matter. Our lives matter, too.”

Around town, houses were marked with what looked at first like little streamers but were really bits of caution tape, placed by a swift-water rescue team, as a preparatory measure, to mark which houses were still occupied: red if a house was empty, yellow if it wasn’t. “It’s rare to see red ones,” said Kiara Rendon, an Allensworth resident. Her car was packed with supplies, for herself and the younger siblings she cares for, but she had yet to leave: “A lot of people didn’t evacuate because this is all they have.” A community leader in Allensworth named Denise Kadara told me the same thing. Allensworth was the first town in California to be established by African Americans. It is named for Col. Allen Allensworth, who escaped slavery by fleeing behind Union lines and then joined the Navy before making his way to California. It later became a home for farmworkers and people who couldn’t afford to live elsewhere. Kadara felt certain that if residents had followed the order to evacuate, Allensworth would have been sacrificed to save other places deemed more valuable.

A few days earlier, Rendon came home to find her sister, five months pregnant and alone with a 3-year-old, shoveling mud as water rose in the field behind their house. Rendon took me to see the spot where a crew from Cal Fire helped the family make a small drainage ditch and where water was finally running away from their home. Her gaze kept drifting east, where the other legacy of the storms, a record-setting snowpack, 50 feet in places, glistened white on the distant mountains.

New York City has invested billions of dollars in storm protection since Hurricane Sandy in 2012, investments that seemed to do little to blunt the impact of the deluge.

Rain poured down in furious torrents, turning the subway system into a kind of flume ride. Central Park recorded 7.19 inches of rain, nearly double the previous record set in 1927 for the same date, according to the National Weather Service, which issued the city’s first-ever flash flood emergency alert.

But the rainfall dumped more water, and faster, than what the city factored into its new storm water maps as an “extreme” flood event.

The storm caused a night of chaos in New York on Sunday, particularly in the Hudson Valley, where up to eight inches of rain fell in some areas and one person died. But its center had shifted to Vermont by Monday, putting the landlocked and mountainous state — and particularly a number of tiny, isolated towns along rivers and creeks, just as when Irene struck — in the cross hairs for major flooding.

Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont said he feared that the sheer volume of water dumped on his state by this week’s storm system could surpass the amount that fell during Irene, which killed six people in Vermont, because the region will be pummeled by rain for several days.

Still, early reports suggested a far less devastating impact than Florida suffered from the storm’s initial impact.

“There is damage, but we will dig out of this as we always do,” said Mark Stevens, director of tourism for Georgetown County, which includes the area where Ian made landfall. “We’re accustomed to hurricane season and what water can bring.”

Some of the most significant impacts were in Pawleys Island, a town on a barrier island just off Georgetown that has long experience with powerful storms.

Part of the town’s pier had collapsed in the storm and was “floating south” in the Atlantic, and “the flooding has been catastrophic,” its police department said on Twitter. But Mr. Stevens said that neither the flooding nor the pier collapse were unusual for Pawleys Island.

Brandon Ellis, director of emergency services for Georgetown County, said that at least half a dozen people had to be rescued from the floodwaters by emergency personnel. Images posted to social media showed roads and homes inundated with water several feet deep.

Jamie Rhome, the acting director of the National Hurricane Center, said in a briefing on Friday afternoon that tropical-storm-force winds were expected along the coast of the Carolinas through early Saturday, bringing the possibility of dangerous storm surge.

“Things are going to go downhill really quickly in the next few hours,” he said of the area, adding that there was still potential for heavy rains inland, downed trees and a “high risk of flooding.”

But some took hope from the relative mildness of Ian’s arrival. Mr. Stevens said that heavy rains Friday morning had ceased after the hurricane made landfall, though flooding and power outages still needed to be rectified. He monitored the situation from his home in Litchfield-by-the-Sea, a few miles from Pawleys Island, as county employees were asked not to commute to work because of the storm.

Chicora Pressley, who works at the front desk at the Hampton Inn in Georgetown, said that some of the waterside hotel’s rooms lost power around 2:30 p.m., shortly after the storm made landfall. She and her colleagues were busy moving guests to rooms that still had electricity.

When Ms. Pressley arrived at the hotel to start her afternoon shift, winds were whipping the trees around, she said. “I can still hear the wind from inside,” she said.

Nearby in Charleston, residents on Friday afternoon were picking up the pieces after several hours of intense wind and rain. Tree branches were scattered along downtown streets and some roads were still flooded, but buildings seemed to have avoided damage. Police officers who had been sheltering in place at their stations during the storm had returned to regular service.

The famous shores of Myrtle Beach, about 90 miles north of Charleston, sustained “significant damage” Friday afternoon and at least three piers washed away, but the city was feeling mostly thankful the hurricane had not been more severe, Mayor Brenda Bethune said.

Thrashing waves and volleys of rain lashed the city earlier, said Ms. Bethune, who lives across the street from the beach. “I could see the waves and the water coming up — it was very intense.”

She said that people had evacuated from a hotel whose roof blew off, and that another spate of wind and rain was expected within a few hours.

People stuck in their cars or in buildings surrounded by water needed to be rescued. The city had received multiple reports of downed power lines and cars stuck in the floodwaters, and there were also reports that strong winds had damaged some structures on the waterfront, said Travis Glatki, the manager of the city’s emergency management division. No fatalities or injuries had been reported, he said.

At the Beverley Beach House, a 25-room oceanfront hotel in Myrtle Beach, Corey Shaw, the general manager, said that he could see the ocean cresting up over the dunes, and that the building’s roof had been damaged. “We’ll just mop it up in the morning,” he said, “and get back to business as usual.”",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,commentary,2,2,1,-0.477,[],"['Carolina', 'Georgetown', 'Myrtle Beach', 'Charleston', 'Police', 'Florida']"

Those days feel increasingly rare.

Heavy rain from a line of storms has deluged the southern tip of the Florida peninsula for several days this week, causing widespread flooding that killed at least two people, overwhelmed roads, crippled vehicles and disrupted life in one of the nation’s busier metropolitan regions. The pounding rain came weeks after the region experienced a stretch of rainless days that were extremely hot, with the heat index last month reaching a record high of 112 degrees.

NOAA’s estimates are “the floor, not a ceiling,” said Abdullah Hasan, a White House spokesman. “States and localities often consider additional factors best suited to their local geographies when making project decisions.”

Every additional increment of global warming increases the likelihood of intense rain in many places for a simple reason: Hotter air can hold more moisture. But NOAA’s estimates of expected rainfall are only intermittently updated. And, as NOAA scientists described in a recent report prepared in collaboration with university researchers, the agency’s estimates assume that the intensity and frequency of extreme rain hasn’t increased in recent decades, despite ample evidence to the contrary.

The result, according to First Street, is that NOAA is substantially underestimating the risk of severe rain in some of the nation’s largest cities: Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, New York, Philadelphia and Washington among them. Other places where there are large differences between First Street’s rainfall estimates and NOAA’s include the Ohio River Basin, northwestern California and parts of the Mountain West.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,0.25,['United States'],"['New York', 'Dallas', 'Philadelphia', 'Washington', 'Chicago', 'Detroit', 'Baltimore', 'Houston']"

Even before the latest deluge, the century-old subway had a longstanding water problem that required work crews to be routinely dispatched to plug leaks. Bored through layers of rock, the subway system snakes through stopped-up natural springs and is surrounded by the groundwater that runs beneath the city.

In fact, about 14 million gallons of water are pumped out of the system on a dry day.

But now, the subway’s water woes are likely to get worse as more extreme rains become increasingly common with the changing climate.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the 472-station subway, has spent $130 million to address water issues as part of a 2017 subway action plan, including cleaning and repairing 40,000 street and sidewalk vents that allow water to run down into the subway, and clearing drainage pipes under tracks and inside stations that carry rainwater to pumps.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,-0.8074,[],['New York']

Farther inland, in North Carolina and Maryland, officials said that flooding would be one of the storm’s most perilous risks.

The storm is expected to soak much of the East Coast in the coming days, prompting state officials to caution residents that they must prepare for heavy rainfall and powerful winds while remaining vigilant against the coronavirus.

769,2020-04-29,This Luxury Tower Has Everything: Pools. A Juice Bar. And Flood Resilience.,"Taken further, the vision behind Monad Terrace’s strategy of resilience is dystopian: As water levels rise, what will happen to waterfront neighborhoods that can’t afford similar defenses? What if in some distant future, flood-resilient housing is a luxury affordable only to the privileged few?

Resilience — defending current conditions as a response to climate change, rather than fully adapting to and anticipating it — is a slippery concept, and in general it needs to be a part of any climate response. But on its own, it represents an outdated way of thinking, the idea that we can somehow stop or contain the forces of nature. It can also be exclusionary and unjust; if we can never stop or contain nature, we will just deflect it — onto those who cannot afford to get out of the way.

Instead, we should focus on equity-minded climate adaptation, on structural changes that will reimagine new urban futures under climate change. Effective adaptation will protect both the physical environment and the social fabric of neighborhoods.

The problem is that adaptation at scale requires collective action; resilience can mean simply leveraging power. Take, for example, the efforts by Peter Secchia, a Michigan businessman, Republican political donor and former U.S. ambassador to Italy, to secure funds to stop beach erosion along a stretch of Lake Michigan — along which Mr. Secchia happens to own a $6 million summer home. When at first his request failed to get a response, he wrote to lawmakers: “This lack of concern mystifies me. Our property values will diminish greatly” — adding, as if to say the quiet part out loud, “hence, our donations will also diminish.”

In California beachfront communities like Pacifica, just south of San Francisco, sea walls are going up to fortify individual homes to protect from coastal erosion. But they come with a cost, disrupting tide patterns and erasing publicly accessible beaches. The plan is controversial, and it has spurred a debate about whether managed retreat — moving inland — would be a more socially and economically viable solution. Needless to say, many opponents of managed retreat stand to benefit from the “resilient” sea walls.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,0.9259,"['United States', 'Italy']","['San Francisco', 'Michigan', 'Pacifica']"

The National Flood Insurance Program, which provides the vast majority of United States flood insurance policies, would have to quadruple premiums on high-risk homes inside floodplains to reflect the risks they already face, according to data issued on Monday by the First Street Foundation, a group of academics and experts that models flood risks.

By 2050, First Street projected, increased flooding tied to climate change will require a sevenfold increase.

The new data could point to higher flood insurance costs this year for homes at risk. On April 1, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs the flood program, is set to announce new premiums, using modern flood-modeling techniques that more closely reflect the actual risks facing individual properties — the same approach that First Street said it had used in its calculations.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,0.0772,['United States'],[]

The facility features backup fuel supplies and on-site sewage treatment, and its critical mechanical and electrical equipment are at least 20 feet above the 100-year floodplain, or the area that would be inundated by a severe flood.

Researchers emphasized, though, that hospital preparedness should not stop at making individual hospitals more resilient. Even if hospital buildings themselves are not flooded, the roads leading to them may still be, effectively cutting off a functional hospital from patients who are trying to reach it, Dr. Bernstein said.

In 18 of the metropolitan areas, at least half of the roads within a mile of the hospitals were at risk of flooding from a Category 2 storm, the researchers said. Hospitals cannot be “a resilient island in a fragile ocean,” said Auroop R. Ganguly, a geosciences and civil engineering professor at Northeastern University who was not involved in the study.

Dr. Bernstein also emphasized that health care providers in some major cities, like New York, Boston and Philadelphia, might face much higher risk than expected. Because of where the hospitals are located and the numbers of hospital beds relative to the populations they serve, when a storm does hit, there will be “more people searching for fewer beds,” he said.

The study contributes to a better understanding of how to characterize the damage that a hurricane can inflict on the communities it hits, said Kristie L. Ebi, a professor in the University of Washington’s Center for Health and the Global Environment who wasn’t involved in the study.

For example, there’s often a perception that much of a hurricane’s damage comes from high winds, Dr. Ebi said, but in reality, it is the flooding that has a much bigger effect on life and property, both during the storm and in its aftermath.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,0,0,1,0.3145,[],"['New York', 'Philadelphia', 'Boston', 'Washington', 'New Orleans']"

789,2022-08-25,Harvey Hit 5 Years Ago. Its Floodwaters Did Not Strike Equitably.,"In the months after Hurricane Harvey, scientists found that climate change most likely made the torrential rainfall that inundated Houston during and after the hurricane much worse, as warmer air holds more moisture that is then unleashed as precipitation. The rainfall total was 15 percent to 38 percent greater than it would have been in a world that was not warming, according to estimates from two studies published in 2017.

For the latest study, published in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers built on those estimates and created several models to reflect a variety of precipitation scenarios. They found that if not for the impact of climate change on rainfall, 30 percent to 50 percent of the flooded properties — or up to 50,000 homes — would have been spared flooding from Harvey.

Even in the most conservative scenario, in which only 7 percent of the precipitation is associated with climate change, the researchers still found that nearly 13 percent of the affected buildings would not have been flooded at all in a nonwarming world.

The study is the latest contribution to the field of climate science called climate attribution, which uses computational modeling and analyses to determine the relationship between specific extreme weather events and global warming.

The novelty of this study is that it goes one step further to look at social inequality through the lens of attribution science, said Antonia Sebastian, an assistant professor of environmental science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who was not involved with the study but helped peer review it.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,1,0.1476,[],"['Chapel Hill', 'Harvey']"

A flash flood warning for southwestern Los Angeles County that had been issued before 7 p.m. expired early Tuesday. The warning affected nearly 8 million of the more than 10 million residents in the county, the most populous in the United States.

The full extent of flooding in the Los Angeles area was not immediately clear in the predawn hours of Tuesday morning. California’s Central Coast, where officials had ordered evacuations on Monday in a coastal enclave of Santa Barbara County, appeared to be the hardest hit area of a state that has been battered in recent weeks by powerful waves of moisture, known as atmospheric rivers.

What Could Go Wrong?,"The agency’s scientists help build the forecasting models used to predict what the weather will look like next week, and what your children’s climate might look like half a century from now. Farmers use the agency’s weather data to plan their crop planting and harvesting, and urban firefighters rely on it to anticipate high wind events and prepare for downed power lines and evacuations. But staffing reductions at NOAA’s National Weather Service offices have suspended the launch of weather balloons that collect wind, temperature and humidity readings from Alaska to Albany.

These cuts threaten your budget, too. Insurance companies rely heavily on data gathered by NOAA and the U.S. Geological Survey to assess wildfire, flood, wind and other risks. Some firms are warning that any interruption in data availability could drive insurance premiums for customers even higher. Other layoffs at the U.S.G.S. could undermine programs that monitor drought and flood conditions, hazardous spills and sewage overflows and the health of salmon fisheries off the Pacific Coast.

And then there’s air pollution. On March 4, the State Department announced that it would no longer share data gathered by air quality monitors at more than 80 U.S. embassies and consulates around the world. With that decision, another one of the government’s most effective global monitoring efforts went dark.

Since the first air quality monitoring system was installed atop the U.S. Embassy in Beijing in 2008, the initiative has yielded a huge return on a modest investment by simply telling people what they’re breathing. During a particularly severe air pollution episode in November 2010, the Beijing monitor tweeted an automated message that air quality in the city had reached “crazy bad” levels. The programmers had written that message in jest, assuming that it would never be triggered because pollution levels would never get that bad. The tweet prompted news stories around the world, and the intense scrutiny helped compel China’s leaders to act. Fifteen years later, China’s air is much cleaner.

From Lagos to Karachi, U.S. Embassy monitors were among the only reliable sources of information about what residents were inhaling every day. One 2022 study found that the air quality readings triggered local policies that substantially reduced particulate matter concentrations, leading to reductions in premature deaths and saving an average of $127 million per city each year. The State Department cited “budget constraints” as the reason for shuttering the program. But the researchers found that the program saved the State Department money — it more than covered its costs by reducing compensation for embassy workers’ pollution exposure.","NOAA’s National Weather Service offices have suspended the launch of weather balloons that collect wind, temperature and humidity readings.

Damaging winds, dangerous surf and widespread flooding are expected for parts of Queensland and northern New South Wales.

The sudden shift in Alfred’s path has caught forecasters by surprise. Initially predicted to continue southward, the storm has now made a sharp turn westward on Tuesday due to a high-pressure system to the south, according to Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology. As a result, the cyclone is now on course to strike the densely populated areas between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast on Friday.

In response, the bureau has issued a tropical cyclone warning from Double Island Point in Queensland to just north of Grafton, New South Wales, an area that includes Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Byron Bay and Ballina. They warned the far western edge of the cyclone was already impacting the coast from Coolangatta to Ballina.

“We can expect to see significant impacts well before landfall for many hours,” said Jonathan How, a meteorologist with the bureau.",Tropical Cyclone Alfred appears set to make landfall this week.

Although the storm is expected to stay offshore for now, it’s still set to bring gusty winds, rising swells and hazardous surf conditions to Queensland’s heavily populated coastline in the coming days.

Forecasters remain uncertain about Alfred’s path beyond the weekend, but they are at least settled on its name. The storm was originally set to be called Anthony, but at the start of February, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology moved to the next name on its predetermined list, potentially to avoid confusion with Anthony Norman Albanese, the country’s current prime minister.

The bureau routinely avoids using the names of prominent people to designate storms, a spokesperson said.

The cyclone season for the Australian region runs from November through the end of April.

Next door and across the street were homes that looked perfectly untouched. Hurricane-force winds had propelled embers at random, sparking house fires that firefighters couldn’t stop. The result was a jarring contrast that only heightened the sense of upheaval.

This had been no hurricane. A hurricane may gather strength rapidly or change direction just before landfall, but it typically arrives with days of warning. It follows a path and often weakens with time. The Eaton fire seemed to follow its own windblown path, but it grew faster than many people could prepare for, and then lingered for weeks afterward. Hurricanes are slow, colossal beasts. Wildfires can be colossal beasts, too, but fast and mean. Hurricanes overwhelm structures but often leave them behind; fires consume them.

Hurricanes smelled different, too. After Hurricane Helene in the Tampa area last year, I visited families cleaning mud from their homes and laying out photographs to dry in the sun. The air smelled like salt, sewage and traces of mildew. In Altadena, two weeks after the fire, the faint smell of smoke still lingered over the ash and dust.

As I spoke with Altadena residents picking through the rubble of their lives, I thought about Trey Camardelle.

825,2025-02-03,That Giant Sucking Sound? It’s Climate Change Devouring Your Home’s Value.,"The implications are staggering: Many Americans could face a paradigm shift in the way they save and how they define their economic security. Climate change is upending the basic assumption that Americans can continue to build wealth and financial security by owning their own homes. In a sense, it is upending the American dream.

Homeownership is the bedrock of America’s economy. Residential real estate in the United States is worth nearly $50 trillion — nearly double the size of the entire gross domestic product. Almost two-thirds of American adults are homeowners, and the median house here has appreciated more than 58 percent over the past two decades, even after accounting for inflation. In Pacific Palisades and Altadena, that evolution elevated many residents into the upper middle class. Across the country homes are the largest asset for most families — who hold approximately 67 percent of their savings in their primary residence.

That is an awful lot to lose: for individuals, and for the nation’s economy.

The First Street researchers found that climate pressures are the main factor driving up insurance costs. Average premiums have risen 31 percent across the country since 2019, and are steeper in high-risk climate zones. Over the next 30 years, if insurance prices are unhindered, they will, on average, leap another 29 percent, according to First Street. Rates in Miami could quadruple. In Sacramento, Calif., they could double.",Homeownership is the bedrock of America’s economy. Residential real estate in the United States is worth nearly $50 trillion.

“Homeowners’ insurance is where many Americans are now feeling the financial effect of climate change directly, in their pocketbook,” said Ethan Zindler, climate counselor at the Treasury Department. “Nature doesn’t really care whether people are living in a blue state or a red state or another state, or whether you do or don’t believe in climate change.”

The rising cancellation rates are part of a broader trend captured by the Treasury Department, which analyzed information for 246 million insurance policies issued by 330 insurers nationwide from 2018 through 2022. The result is the most comprehensive look yet at the effect of climate change on the American home insurance market.

Homeowners with mortgages are generally required by lenders to carry insurance. But people who own a house outright, perhaps because the property has been in a family for decades or generations, have the option of dropping insurance.

The cost and frequency of insurance claims are rising quickly in the highest-risk parts of the United States, as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to the numbers. They show that the financial stress on insurers is also growing.

So, too, is the cost of insurance, which has risen far more in high-risk areas than elsewhere.

As those trends worsen, more people are getting thrown off their insurance plans. That happens two ways. One is through cancellations, when insurers drop homeowners who fail to pay their premiums. Another is through nonrenewals, in which insurers refuse to renew the policies of homeowners who want to keep paying for coverage.

The rates of both cancellations and nonrenewals are increasing, and those increases are most pronounced in high-risk areas.

Total nonrenewals + cancellations nonrenewals nonpayment cancellations 2.5% 2.5% Very high 6.0% 2.0% 5.0% 2.0% 1.5% High Moderate Low 1.0% 4.0% Very low 1.5% 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Higher Risk, Fewer Insured Homeowners policies in the riskiest areas have been increasingly dropped by insurance companies or cancelled for missed payments.

High risk 4.5% policies dropped Moderate Low 4.0% 3.5% 2018 2022 Sources: National Association of Insurance Commissioners and Federal Insurance Office, U.S. Department of the Treasury; FEMA.

In more than 150 ZIP codes around the country, insurers canceled at least 10 percent of home insurance policies in 2022, the most recent year for which numbers are available, because homeowners failed to pay their premiums, according to the data. Cancellation rates were highest in coastal areas in the Carolinas, including Hilton Head, Charleston and Myrtle Beach, which are especially exposed to hurricanes. They were also high in parts of West Virginia, Arizona and California.

The data doesn’t capture why homeowners chose to stop paying. But Nellie Liang, the Treasury Department’s under secretary for domestic finance, said her team viewed it as an indicator of families facing growing financial stress worsened by climate change.

“Households are not able to bear the burden by themselves,” Ms. Liang said.

As for cases where insurance companies refused to renew policies even for their paying customers, those nonrenewal rates were also higher, and grew faster, in high-risk areas. The ZIP codes with the greatest share of nonrenewals in 2022 were in coastal South Carolina as well as parts of California, including in Sonoma County and Yuba County, which have been hit by wildfires. Areas of Tennessee that have suffered severe storms also saw high nonrenewals.

The destabilization of the home insurance market doesn’t hurt only homeowners, Ms. Liang said. It also threatens property-tax revenues that communities rely on, since tax receipts can decline if homeowners can’t rebuild or if homes lose value. It also hurts local businesses that rely on homeowners as customers.

“There’s a lot to worry about,” Ms. Liang said.

The Treasury Department’s effort to gather data was complicated by the political clashes over climate change, and also over who gets to regulate insurance companies.

The department announced the effort in 2021 as part of the Biden administration’s efforts to address the financial effects of climate change. Its original plan was to gather data directly from insurance companies. But some state insurance commissioners (which regulate the industry) objected, backed by Republicans in Congress.

So the Treasury Department let state commissioners gather the data. Or not gather it: Seven states — Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, Indiana, Montana and North Dakota — declined to participate. According to the Treasury Department, this meant that local insurance companies that happen to be headquartered in those states did not provide data. But national insurers still provided data for homeowners they cover in those states. (Another exception was Texas, where they did not provide some data.)

In addition, the states that did participate chose to withhold some important information, including data from their state-mandated high-risk-insurance plans. Those plans, which are designed to provide insurance to people who can’t buy it from regular insurance companies, are becoming more important as climate change worsens. Excluding those plans means the data doesn’t capture the experience of many homeowners facing the highest risk from climate threats.

And of the data that was collected, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents state commissioners and compiled data from them, shared only a portion with the Treasury Department.

The association did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Treasury Department, as part of its report, called on state commissioners and the national association to keep working with the agency’s Federal Insurance Office to gather and publish the data annually, and even expand that effort by including information for high-risk pools.

The chances of that happening are unclear. Last month, Republican state insurance commissioners wrote to Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the leaders of what President-elect Donald J. Trump has called his new Department of Government Efficiency, urging them to scrap the Federal Insurance Office altogether.

They argued that the office’s work gathering data on climate change showed that the federal government was trying to exceed its authority and that, by moving ahead with releasing the new data, the office “has chosen to proceed with flawed information, which risks misleading the public.” The commissioners did not say why they viewed the information as flawed.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.9989,"['United States', 'Georgia']","['Montana', 'Myrtle Beach', 'Texas', 'Charleston', 'Iowa', 'Florida']"

As Los Angeles burned for days on end, horrifying the nation, scientists made an announcement on Friday that could help explain the deadly conflagration: 2024 was the hottest year in recorded history.

With temperatures rising around the globe and the oceans unusually warm, scientists are warning that the world has entered a dangerous new era of chaotic floods, storms and fires made worse by human-caused climate change.

The firestorms ravaging the country’s second-largest city are just the latest spasm of extreme weather that is growing more furious as well as more unpredictable. Wildfires are highly unusual in Southern California in January, which is supposed to be the rainy season.

Only about a quarter of the Earth’s tropical cyclones form in the Southern Hemisphere. When these storms have sustained winds of 74 m.p.h. or greater, they would be called hurricanes in the Atlantic, but here, they are called cyclones. The only other difference is that, in the Southern Hemisphere, cyclones spin clockwise (hurricanes spin counterclockwise).

Cyclones can strike eastern Africa, primarily Madagascar, as well as the western, northern and eastern coasts of Australia and surrounding island nations.

The season here runs opposite the rest of the world, typically beginning in late October and running through May.

The insurance crisis has also spread far beyond the coasts, with rates of dropped policies jumping in many U.S. counties over the past several years.

Those spikes may come after a large disaster hits, but not always. In some places, such as Oklahoma, they coincide with growing premiums, but in others, insurers and state regulators may keep prices flat while dropping policies.

Communities deemed too dangerous to insure risk seeing property values fall, along with local tax revenue, stripping money from schools, police and other basic services. As insurers pull back from areas across the country exposed to climate change risks, where policies aren’t getting renewed is a key predictor of the disruption to come.

832,2024-12-18,Insurers Are Deserting Homeowners as Climate Shocks Worsen,"Insurers Are Deserting Homeowners as Climate Shocks Worsen Without insurance, it’s impossible to get a mortgage; without a mortgage, most Americans can’t buy a home. The home of Richard D. Zimmel on the outskirts of Silver City, N.M.

The insurance crisis spreading across the United States arrived at Richard D. Zimmel’s door last week in the form of a letter.

Mr. Zimmel, who lives in the increasingly fire-prone hills outside Silver City, N.M., had done everything right. He trimmed the trees away from his house, and covered his yard in gravel to stop flames rushing in from the forest near his property. In case that buffer zone failed, he sheathed his house in fire-resistant stucco, and topped it with a noncombustible steel roof.

None of it mattered. His insurance company, Homesite Insurance, dumped him. “Property is located in a brushfire or wildfire area that no longer meets Homesite’s minimum standard for wildfire risk,” the letter read. (Homesite did not respond to a request for comment.)

Mr. Zimmel has company. Since 2018, more than 1.9 million home insurance contracts nationwide have been dropped — “nonrenewed,” in the parlance of the industry. In more than 200 counties, the nonrenewal rate has tripled or more, according to the findings of a congressional investigation released Wednesday.

As a warming planet delivers more wildfires, hurricanes and other threats, America’s once reliably boring home insurance market has become the place where climate shocks collide with everyday life.

The consequences could be profound. Without insurance, you can’t get a mortgage; without a mortgage, most Americans can’t buy a home. Communities that are deemed too dangerous to insure face the risk of falling property values, which means less tax revenue for schools, police and other basic services. As insurers pull back, they can destabilize the communities left behind, making their decisions a predictor of the disruption to come.

Now, for the first time, the scale of that pullback is becoming public. Last fall, the Senate Budget Committee demanded the country’s largest insurance companies provide the number of nonrenewals by county and year. The result is a map that tracks the climate crisis in a new way.

The American Property Casualty Insurance Association, a trade group, said information about nonrenewals was “unsuitable for providing meaningful information about climate change impacts,” because the data doesn’t show why individual insurers made decisions. The group added that efforts to gather data from insurers “could have an anticompetitive effect on the market.”

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island and the committee’s chairman, said the new information was crucial. In an interview, he called the new data as good an indicator as any “for predicting the likelihood and timing of a significant, systemic economic crash,” as disruption in the insurance market spreads to property values.

“The climate crisis that is coming our way is not just about polar bears, and it’s not just about green jobs,” Mr. Whitehouse said Wednesday during a hearing on the investigation’s findings. “It actually is coming through your mail slot, in the form of insurance cancellations, insurance nonrenewals and dramatic increases in insurance costs.”

The map of dropped policies shows how the crisis in the American home insurance market has spread beyond well-known problems in Florida and California. The jump in nonrenewals now extends along the Gulf Coast, through Alabama and Mississippi; up the Atlantic seaboard, through the Carolinas, Virginia and into southern New England; inland, to parts of the plains and Intermountain West; and even as far as Hawaii.

Silver City shows how the insurance crisis is a result of several factors over decades — and how hard it is to solve.

Founded as a mining town in the 1870s, the city of 10,000 nestles up against the foothills of the Gila National Forest, 3.3 million acres of alligator juniper, ponderosa pine and Gambel oak draped across softly sloping mountains.

That forest has also become a firetrap.

Since its designation as a national forest in 1924, the U.S. government sought to protect the land by stopping forest fires. That policy failed to take into account that fires clear out vegetation, according to Adam Mendonca, the U.S. Forest Service’s Washington deputy director of fire and aviation, who lives in Silver City. The result was the buildup of decades of additional trees and brush, which means wildfires, when they do happen, now burn larger and hotter.

That threat has been exacerbated by climate change, which has brought higher temperatures and drier conditions. Wildfires are now more likely to break out any time of year.

“We used to take our wildland gear home, put it into storage about September, and then bring it back to the station in February,” said Milo Lambert, Silver City’s fire chief. “Now it doesn’t leave the trucks.”

Even as the threat of wildfires has grown, home construction has pushed further into the forest. On a recent afternoon, Eric Casler, an assistant professor of natural sciences at Western New Mexico University, surveyed the neighborhoods that have grown up north of the city limits.

“See all these scattered houses out here?” Mr. Casler said. If a wildfire started to burn through the area, “it’s going to be really hard for them to stop it.”

It’s not just where people build homes that puts them at risk, experts said, but how those homes are constructed. Outside city limits, Grant County has no zoning or wildfire building restrictions, according to Roger Groves, the fire chief for the county, which includes Silver City.

Taken together, those challenges have caused insurers to pull back, according to Susan Sumrall, an insurance agent in Silver City.

Across Grant County, 51 home insurance contracts were not renewed in 2018, based on the data provided to the committee. That’s about one in 100 policies. By last year, that number had doubled to 100 nonrenewals, even as the county’s total population shrank.

One of Ms. Sumrall’s clients who has lost her insurance is Charlene Rosati. Ms. Rosati and her husband had to spend months in Houston, where he was being treated for cancer. Her insurance company, State Farm, sent an inspector to check if the home was being properly maintained, Ms. Rosati said, and concluded it was not.

Ms. Rosati’s husband died in September last year. Soon after, State Farm told her it wouldn’t renew her coverage. The company did not respond to a request for comment.

Many homes in and around Silver City are mobile or manufactured homes, which can offer less protection against fires than traditional site-built houses. Lorri Williams lives in a manufactured home in a valley just outside of Silver City. She, too, got a letter from her insurer, Standard Casualty Company, based in Texas.

“Reason — unsatisfactory risk,” the company wrote in block letters. “Your home is either located inside of or in close proximity of an area that is identified as having a high risk of wildfire.”

Standard Casualty Company did not respond to a request for comment.

People who lose insurance often don’t have great options. Ms. Williams’s broker, Chelsea Hotchkiss, tried getting her another insurer, with no luck. Ms. Hotchkiss suggested the state-run high-risk insurance program, which offers coverage to homeowners who can’t find it on the private market. But that program is more expensive and provides less coverage.

After Mr. Zimmel got his nonrenewal letter last week, he called State Farm, which declined to cover him. His insurance agent struck out with three more carriers, including Travelers. (State Farm and Travelers did not respond to requests for comment.) Finally, a smaller company agreed to insure his house, but his premiums jumped by one-third.

Mr. Zimmel’s bigger worry, he said, is how the struggle over insurance could affect his home’s value, which his real estate agent estimates at about $725,000.

“I just don’t know what’s going to happen to the town if this keeps happening,” said Mr. Zimmel’s agent, Shelley Scarborough.

Officials are trying to reduce wildfire risk. The county is looking at setting building standards to cut fire exposure, Mr. Groves said. State officials are also considering ways to get more homeowners to clear the vegetation from their property, possibly through a pilot project in nearby Lincoln County that would make those steps necessary to qualify for the state high-risk insurance pool.

And the U.S. Forest Service is trying to clear out decades’ worth of thick brush and other excess vegetation — what experts call “treating” the forest. That process is anything but simple.

In the parts of the forest nearest the city, workers have cut down smaller trees, low-hanging branches and scrub oak, then stacked them into piles to dry out. After a year or so, the piles are set on fire — ideally during the winter, to reduce the risk of the fire spreading.

After those two steps, the Forest Service can perform a prescribed burn: deliberately setting fire to a patch of the forest to further clear out the vegetation. To maintain that work, the process should typically be repeated every five to 10 years.

The Forest Service has been treating between 25,000 and 30,000 of the 3.3 million acres in the Gila Forest each year, according to Mr. Mendonca. “It’s a constant struggle for the agency to try to address,” he said, citing a shortage of staffing, money and time.

U.S. Forest Service and Conservation Corps New Mexico members refilled their drip torches while conducting a prescribed fire in Mimbres.

The underlying challenges that are driving insurers from Silver City can be found across the country.

In parts of Wyoming, the growing risk of wildfire is similarly pushing insurers to drop customers. Teton County, which includes Jackson Hole, saw nonrenewal rates increase 1,394 percent since 2018. Jeff Rude, the state insurance commissioner, said the state was focused on educating homeowners about how to reduce the risk on their land, because tougher building standards are unpopular in Wyoming.

In California, which has some of the country’s most stringent building codes to address wildfire risk, insurers have nonetheless been fleeing. In some counties, nonrenewal rates have increased more than 500 percent since 2018. Officials announced last week that they would make it easier for insurers to raise rates, but in exchange, those insurers must agree to keep doing business in fire-prone areas.

In Hawaii, the nonrenewal rate tripled between 2018 and 2023, one of the highest increases in the country. The growing risk from wildfires and other threats has led to what Gov. Josh Green, a Democrat, has called a “condo insurance crisis.” In August, he signed an emergency proclamation, setting up a task force to search for solutions.

In coastal South Carolina, which now has some of the highest nonrenewal rates in the country, insurers have been going out of business, reducing their exposure or just leaving the area, said Jay Taylor, an insurance agent in Beaufort County, which includes Hilton Head, an area particularly exposed to sea-level rise, hurricanes and other climate threats.

Homeowners complain about the difficulty and cost of getting insurance, he said. But the desire to live by the ocean, despite the danger, remains the stronger force.

“They may cuss us out,” Mr. Taylor said. “But they never stop building.”

Hundreds or even thousands are feared dead as a result of Tropical Cyclone Chido, which barreled into Mayotte, a series of islands off the eastern coast of Africa, over the weekend. French officials have said it could take days to know the true death toll, because roughly a third of the territory’s 320,000 residents are undocumented immigrants, and many live in shanty towns.

The cyclone also slammed into Mozambique with heavy rains and strong winds, killing at least 34 people and completely or partly destroying over 35,000 houses, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Aid agencies fear that number also may increase as the scale of the disaster becomes clearer.

Officials who toured Mayotte said the devastation had spared no corner of the tiny archipelago, France’s poorest territory.

835,2024-12-07,Mortgage Regulators Are Shrugging Off Climate Risk. It Could Cost Taxpayers Billions.,"One report has estimated that homes in places at risk of flooding were collectively overpriced by at least $187 billion; in some counties in Appalachia and coastal Louisiana, that amounts to more than 10 percent of the total property value. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office found that federally backed mortgages covered properties that were likely to sustain about $190 billion in flood damage over 30 years. That’s not counting the peril of wildfires or drought.

While banks are becoming more careful about extending credit in areas that might flood, and homeowners are responding to flood risk disclosures on property search websites, the government-sponsored enterprises do not formally take such risks into account when underwriting loans. Studies have found that banks are more likely to sell mortgages in risky areas to the secondary market, and to Fannie and Freddie specifically after hurricanes (a conclusion that economists funded by Fannie Mae have disputed).

Fannie and Freddie have generally relied on insurance to deal with climate risk management: Flood coverage is required in special flood hazard areas.

That has become a riskier gambit in recent years, however, as disasters have also hit places far beyond where federal flood maps say they’re supposed to. At the same time, extreme weather has driven up insurance costs nationwide. Recent research has found that those rising costs can drive homeowners into delinquency, even if the house avoids damage.

Unexpectedly large losses could undermine Fannie’s and Freddie’s profits and threaten their ability to keep the mortgage market liquid, said Susan Crawford, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who wrote a book last year about the impact of sea-level rise in Charleston, S.C.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.9368,[],['Charleston']
836,2024-12-01,Republicans Would Regret Letting Elon Musk Ax Weather Forecasting,"The best-known part of NOAA, touching all of our daily lives, is the National Weather Service. This is where daily forecasts and timely warning of severe storms, hurricanes and blizzards come from. Using satellites, balloon launches, ships, aircraft and weather stations, NOAA and its offices around the country provide vital services like clockwork, free of charge — services that cannot be adequately replaced by the private sector in part because they wouldn’t necessarily be profitable.

For most of its history, NOAA has largely avoided politicization especially because weather forecasting has been seen as nonpartisan. Members of Congress from both parties are highly engaged in its work. Unfortunately, legislation introduced by Representative Frank Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma — a state with a lot of tornadoes — that would have helped NOAA to update its weather research and forecasting programs passed the House but languished in the Senate and is unlikely to move forward in this session of Congress. However, in 2025 there is another opportunity to improve the agency and its services to taxpayers and businesses.

While there are already multiple efforts at NOAA to improve weather modeling, observation collection and marine management, Congress has piled more responsibilities on the agency, and the funding has not kept up. NOAA is spread thin, with a backlog of maintenance and upgrades that will probably take years to get through without significantly more sustained budget support.

As we enter a new world of artificial intelligence, NOAA needs significantly more computational resources to improve weather models rapidly. Otherwise, the United States risks becoming more dependent on similar institutions in Europe. Plain and simple, NOAA weather modeling and climate analysis efforts do not have the funding in the current institutional structure to keep up with our European friends. And because the military relies on NOAA’s infrastructure, the risks of and damage from extreme weather and climate events are a national security concern as much as an economic one. With a bigger budget, NOAA could offer increased value for taxpayers and boost the entire U.S. economy. What would that look like?

First, we need to have a serious conversation about further upgrading the agency’s aging systems like radars; observations, including balloons and buoys; research aircraft; satellites; and supercomputers. There is also an opportunity to build a state-of-the-art weather and climate prediction capability for the nation. That would involve modernizing emergency communication systems for future disasters instead of reacting to the most recent one. Though accurate weather forecasts, combined with effective watches and warnings, have reduced human deaths from extreme weather, still too many Americans are seemingly caught off guard by weather disasters. NOAA could help fix this.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,2,0,1,0.9905,['United States'],"['Lucas', 'Oklahoma']"

But some places are less safe than others. Atop the list of unsafe places is New Orleans. But unlike the other major cities that appear on such lists (Phoenix; Norfolk, Va.; Tampa Bay, Fla; New York), New Orleans has a striking competitive advantage.

By The New York Times

Sara is the 18th named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.9767,"['United States', 'Mexico']","['Leer', 'New York']"

846,2024-11-13,Climate Change Is Losing Its Grip on Our Politics,"When the COP29 climate conference comes to an end next week, it will have concluded without an appearance by President Biden. This is not because Donald Trump just won the election, supplanting the outgoing American head of state on the world stage. The president-elect isn’t attending, either. Neither is Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he defeated on Nov. 5.

It’s not just the Americans who are AWOL. Hardly any of the world’s most powerful leaders will be making an appearance in Baku, Azerbaijan — yet another year that the annual Conference of the Parties, convened to stem the problem of warming, has been hosted by a petrostate. President Xi Jinping of China won’t be there, and neither will Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. President Emmanuel Macron of France, the bedraggled face of Western liberalism, is skipping the conference, too. Also missing will be Lula da Silva, who is the leader not just of Brazil but also of the Group of 20. As recently as the Glasgow summit in 2021, the annual climate confab was a who’s who of global power politics. These days, it’s more about who’s missing.

Trump’s election may look like a black dawn to climate activists. And indeed it is: When the timelines of climate action are so short, and the paths to climate stability so narrow and difficult, any setback is a disaster. In 2018, considering a world 1.5 degrees warmer than in preindustrial times, the world’s scientists issued an unignorable warning about the consequences; in 2024, according to a Carbon Brief analysis, we have already surpassed 1.5. And now we know, almost surely, that the United States will be leading the world more quickly and belligerently into that danger zone, not helping to chart a way out of it.

But the skeptic’s election is also a confirmation of an international turn in the politics of warming as much as it is a sharp or distinctly American break. Yes, a global renewables boom is well underway, with worldwide investment in clean energy reaching $2 trillion this year and total solar capacity doubling since 2022. But the climate logic of that transition increasingly goes unspoken in all but the most committed corners, replaced by chin-scratching about energy politics. Governments have retreated from even their legally binding promises to decarbonize, trusting markets to deliver comparatively meager emissions reductions instead, and activists have been unable to generate meaningful public outrage at the walkback.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,0.9428,"['Brazil', 'United States', 'China', 'Azerbaijan', 'France']","['Baku', 'Glasgow']"

It’s an expert hypothesis based on all the available data, and meteorologists will look at trends in the data when they draw up a forecast. The global models used by experts, the Global Forecast Model and the European model, are updated four times a day, and each time forecasters will consider what has changed and what has been consistent from one to another. From this, and with the passage of time, they start to draw a likely forecast.

On Thursday afternoon, the American model runs continued to show a storm forming in the Caribbean, moving into the Gulf of Mexico and approaching Florida on Election Day.

Other forecast models, though, showed nothing like this potential storm. A concern troubling forecasters on Thursday was that the other models did show the type of weather conditions that could be favorable for some tropical activity in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico during the same time period.

Some schools and workplaces were closed, and dam operators were anticipating heavy rain.

The Philippine Coast Guard was tasked with ensuring that supplies reached isolated communities, particularly in the northern province of Batanes, a remote archipelago.

On Wednesday, President Ferdinand R.

851,2024-10-23,I Broke Down About Hurricane Milton on Live TV. What Happened Next Surprised Me.,"A recent survey of Americans ages 16 to 25 showed that 85 percent were worried about the climate crisis. The majority, 57 percent, were “very or extremely” worried. More broadly, 64 percent of Americans across all generations say they are at least “somewhat worried” about global warming. Whether you were born into this changed planet or, like me, have seen it degenerate before your very eyes, there’s plenty to fret about.

And yet, two out of every three Americans say they “rarely” or “never” discuss global warming with family and friends. That must change. My connection and level of comfort with the audience allowed me to show my emotions without fear of judgment. It might sound corny, but it was like I was speaking to family and friends. If I can do it over the airwaves, shouldn’t everyone be able to do it at the kitchen table?

If we can have more conversations about climate change and how it’s making us feel, we can share the burden and prioritize action.

Action on climate isn’t just what you can do on your own but also what you can do with others. If your neighborhood or school can switch to renewable energy, heat pumps and electric vehicles to lower their carbon footprint, it’s far more powerful than making those changes inside your household. One example is the 19-fold increase over the last five years in the size of the electric school bus fleet. Overall, the United States spent a record $248 billion in 2023 on the clean energy transition, more than triple what it was in 2018.

We must also look for more ways to scale community actions to the city, county, state and the nation. The way to demand that kind of large-scale action on climate is to identify and support elected leaders who can sway and enact climate-friendly policies. For those leaders who don’t, the power of your vote can hold them accountable.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,0.9803,['United States'],['Milton']

Evacuees spread across two buildings designated as shelters by the Florida Division of Emergency Management: a K-12 school held about 400 people and a 40,000-square-foot sports facility housed about 1,600 more.

All the structures at Babcock Ranch are built to withstand more than 150-mile-per-hour hurricane force winds, and its 150-megawatt solar farms and underground transmission system means the community rarely loses electricity.

Hurricane season had been quiet and the number of wildfires was still below the yearly average. Insurers were beginning to hope that the cost of reinsurance — that is, insurance for insurers — would only inch up next year, instead of shooting higher as it did the previous two years.

Two major hurricanes have upended their calculations.

Total economic losses from Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene could soar over $200 billion, according to early estimates. While it’s far too soon to know exactly what portion will be covered by insurance companies, some consumer groups, lawmakers and analysts are already worried about a big hit to insurers’ finances that could ultimately affect millions of people living in the most vulnerable areas.

As climate change increases the intensity of natural disasters, insurance companies have pulled back from many high-risk areas by raising premiums or ending some types of coverage. The fallout from the two hurricanes, which landed within the span of two weeks, could accelerate that retreat. It could also further strain an already feeble federal flood insurance program that has filled in gaps for homeowners living in areas where private insurance companies no longer offer flood coverage.

Supercharged hurricanes are no longer outliers, freak disasters or storms of the century. Fossil fuel pollution has made them a fixture of life around the world, and they are going to get worse — with millions of people in their cross hairs.

Many Americans refuse to believe that a major hurricane could hit them. The United States government isn’t much better. Flood insurance remains optional for many coastal residents. Homes continue to be built — and rebuilt — in low-lying flood zones. State governments often lack the funds and staffing to manage recovery. Some loans from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to rebuild are contingent on good credit. But if we are going to withstand this new era of extreme weather, we need to be honest about what has become the most expensive and deadliest kind of natural disaster in the country.

I spent the past three years sailing through storms and visiting research labs around the world to learn about the recent increase in extreme cyclones. I spoke to captains who logged changes in the Gulf Stream, the jet stream, trade winds and storm seasons. I interviewed scientists who studied amplifying typhoons in the Pacific, whose barometric pressure could drop so low that they triggered a spider web of earthquakes. I studied major cyclones that hit parts of the Middle East for the first time and some of the first hurricane landfalls to strike Europe. Experts consistently tied storm intensity, range and destruction to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere — and said that if we reduced it, storm intensity would diminish in lock step.

Here is a glimpse of where we are headed. The heat accumulating in the ocean from global warming will make tropical cyclones last longer than they once did and occasionally move slower, making damage many times worse. Rapid intensification — in which storm winds increase by 35 miles per hour or more in 24 hours — will continue to rise, especially in coastal waters.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,1,0,1,-0.965,['United States'],['Florida']

Tornado warnings were issued across the region, and as far away as Fort Pierce on the Atlantic Coast, with forecasters expressing concern about the threat of more damage.

Tornadoes that accompany tropical systems are usually weak and short-lived. But those accompanying Milton were slightly more intense — “a little out of the ordinary,” said Bill Bunting, with the Storm Prediction Center. “It’s quite a day and, unfortunately, probably just a portent of more to come,” he said.

Generally, as long as the hurricane remains over water, no tornadoes will form, said Jana Houser, an associate professor of meteorology at Ohio University. That is because the surface of the water is relatively smooth, and in the formation of tornadoes, “the biggest culprit is surface friction,” she said.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.8235,[],"['Fort Pierce', 'Milton', 'Fort Myers']"
862,2024-10-08,Record Hot Water Is Fueling Hurricane Milton,"“That is one of the essential ingredients for hurricane formation,” Dr. Lopez said.

The feverish ocean waters caused rapid intensification, where wind speeds increased by 35 miles per hour or more over 24 hours.

The speed at which Milton grew caused John Morales, a veteran meteorologist of 40 years, to become emotional on air on Monday.

“This is just horrific,” Mr. Morales said, adding: “The seas are just so incredibly, incredibly hot. Record hot as you might imagine. You know what’s driving that. I don’t need to tell you: global warming, climate change.”

Hurricane Milton has since been downgraded to a Category 4 storm and is expected to make landfall in the very early hours of Wednesday as a Category 3. It is still a major threat to infrastructure and human life with powerful winds and a projected storm surge of up to 15 feet in the Tampa, Fla., area.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,commentary,0,0,0,0.3415,[],"['Lopez', 'Tampa', 'Morales', 'Milton']"
863,2024-10-11,How Does Florida Insure Itself Against Hurricanes Like These?,"But getting there isn’t easy. Climate change has made living in Florida riskier, but when insurance companies try to charge actuarially fair premiums, they receive strong pushback. Nationally, the flood insurance market is so dysfunctional that the federal government has had to take over most of it. And that’s not working, either. Rates are still subsidized, though less than before, so taxpayers who live high and dry are potentially on the hook for losses by people who get flooded out, in some cases repeatedly.

So, what to do? While Florida can’t control the weather, there are things that it can do to reduce the economic damage that storms cause. It has done some of them, but there are still weaknesses in the system — and according to one recent study, a devastating hurricane in Florida could ripple all the way to the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

First the improvements: In 2019 and 2022, the State Legislature enacted laws that cracked down on insurance fraud and abuse. It was common in Florida for someone with an insurance claim to sell it for instant cash to a third party such as a roofer or a water extraction company. The new owner of the claim would sometimes do overpriced or shoddy work and then sue to get fully paid by the insurer. The reduction in so-called assignment of benefits insurance fraud and abuse has sharply slowed the rate of premium increases and allowed 15 companies to reduce their rates this year.

Under Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida has given grants totaling $250 million in the past year or so to help make homes hurricane-resistant. I don’t know if that’s sufficient, but it helps. A little money spent for protection can save a lot more when a storm hits.

There’s also been some progress on the issue of under-insurance, particularly against the risk of floods. People are required to have flood insurance to qualify for a federally regulated or insured mortgage only if where they live is estimated to have a 1 percent or higher chance of getting flooded in any given year. One carrier, Olympus Insurance, estimated that more than 850,000 Floridians in high-risk flood areas — presumably without such mortgages — don’t have flood insurance, whether they realize it or not.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.8329,[],['Florida']
864,2024-10-09,A Meteorologist’s Ashes Took a Final Mission Into Hurricane Milton,"Mr. Dodge, a Florida resident who celebrated 44 years of federal service before his death last year, had advanced expertise in radar technology and collaborated with the National Hurricane Center and Aircraft Operations Center on land-based and airborne radar research, according to the NOAA meteorological laboratory.

The lab added that during hurricane seasons, Mr. Dodge would serve as the onboard radar scientist on hurricane missions. He also designed flight modules and coordinated with research landfall teams to gather data with mobile weather platforms, contributing to efforts to better understand the evolution of hurricanes’ structures.

Over the course of Mr. Dodge’s career, he received the Department of Commerce Bronze Medal, two NOAA Administrator Awards, and the Army Corps of Engineers Patriotic Civilian Service Award.

On Mr. Dodge’s final flight on Tuesday, the Hurricane Hunters were gathering data, inside, above and around Hurricane Milton to provide critical and real-time information to the National Hurricane Center as well as other modelers and forecasters, the lab said.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, comments honoring Mr. Dodge poured in on social media.

In just a few short hours on Monday, Hurricane Milton grew from a Category 1 to a Category 5, the strongest rating on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which classifies hurricanes based on their wind speed.

Milton formed as a tropical storm on Saturday afternoon and became a hurricane on Sunday just before 2 p.m. Eastern.

It remained a Category 1 until early Monday morning, when the National Hurricane Center announced around 5 a.m. Eastern time that the storm had been elevated to a Category 2 hurricane.

Its path of destruction was uneven, though, and in many areas, officials were working to make repairs.

Some places near the Gulf of Mexico, as well as farther inland, were inundated, though not to the degree that officials had feared. Many homes in the storm’s path were leveled — by one early estimate, more than 120 were destroyed — while other structures nearby remained intact. At least 14 deaths have been linked to the storm.

“We did not get the worst-case scenario,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said after the storm passed. “But we did get hit, and we’re going to have to work to bounce back.”

Here is what we know about the storm and its impact.

How bad was the damage from the hurricane?

The damage varied from one county to the next. The Tampa Bay region did not experience the disastrous storm surge that many forecasters had feared. Still, there was serious flooding along the Gulf Coast, which received as much as 18 inches of rain. And some areas were battered by strong winds, particularly barrier islands in the direct path of the storm.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,2,0,1,-0.9427,['Mexico'],"['Bay', 'Florida', 'Milton']"

869,2024-10-11,How Global Warming Made Hurricane Milton More Intense and Destructive,"The second analysis, by researchers at Imperial College London, sought to estimate how much more economic loss a storm like Milton could cause compared with a similarly infrequent storm in an alternate version of today’s world, one with the same level of development and hurricane readiness, but without planet-warming emissions.

The researchers drew upon information from previous studies of how the property damage from past hurricanes that hit the United States varied in response to where the storms came ashore and their maximum wind speeds.

High winds aren’t the only cause of destruction during a hurricane: Flooding, storm surge and tornadoes matter, too. But small-seeming jumps in a hurricane’s wind speeds can translate into big increases in damage, said Ralf Toumi, a climate scientist at Imperial College London who worked on the analysis.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a hurricane’s potential damage in the United States rises by roughly a factor of four for every increase in the storm’s category rating. Milton made landfall this week as a Category 3 storm.

Think about it this way, Dr. Toumi said: In the chaos of a hurricane, the damage multiplies. The winds turn debris — or, say, the roof of your neighbor’s house — into flying projectiles.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,0,0,1,-0.9603,['United States'],"['London', 'Milton']"
870,2024-10-08,Hurricane Milton’s Storm Surge Risk Across Florida,"Hurricane Milton’s Storm Surge Risk Across Florida

As Hurricane Milton approaches landfall in Florida this week, the National Hurricane Center is releasing a series of data sets to help warn the public of the risks. Storm surge is one of the deadliest aspects of a strong hurricane as it approaches land.

Depending on exactly where Milton makes landfall, storm surge will broadly fluctuate. As it approaches the Florida coast, any minor wobble in the storm’s path could vastly change where the worst surge piles up.

The area surrounding Cedar Key is still dealing with the effects of Hurricane Helene. For now, it appears residents there will be less affected by Milton. As the forecast path adjusts, the Tampa Bay area continually seems like it will near Milton's path. The area will most likely see some large swells. Residents have been urged to evacuate. The Fort Myers area was devastated by Hurricane Ian in 2022. This area is again forecast for a storm surge above six feet across large areas. Naples and the Everglades will bear the brunt of the winds coming off the southern part of the storm. The Florida Keys are forecast to experience strong winds and storm surge mostly below six feet.

The uncertainty of the storm surge’s eventual impacts is especially true for Tampa Bay.

If Milton tracks south of Tampa Bay, there could be far less surge there than during Hurricane Helene last month, said Robert Weisberg, a professor emeritus at the University of South Florida. His work as an oceanographer — including a 2006 study on storm surges in the Tampa Bay area — helped begin the conversation about the region’s vulnerabilities.

Dr. Weisberg said there is even the potential, if Milton is far enough south, for the storm to produce a reverse surge, as Ian did, pushing water out of the bay.

If the storm were to take a jog north, it would be a far more serious situation. “I hate to imagine what could happen if it does that,” he said.

If the storm were to make landfall near Clearwater, for example, the strongest winds along the eyewall could push the surge through the mouth of the bay.

The problem with the bay is that it is very long, Dr. Weisberg said, and the hurricane storm surge is really a slope with the highest amount of water piling up where it is pushed against the shore.

In a simplified example of a surge, if you were to blow across the top of a cup of water, you could see how it piled against the edge of the cup. This is similar to how water behaves in shallow places as wind whips across its surface.

Like the cup’s edge, water cannot penetrate the land. So as it drives water into the shoreline, it piles up.

If the storm makes landfall farther north, and those winds push up the bay, all of that water would be pushed right into Tampa, and the upper reaches of the bay would have a larger surge.

On top of the surge, come the waves, which can damage structures. “If people are in the way of the waves, they’re going to die. It’s as simple as that,” Dr. Weisberg said.

Wherever Milton makes landfall, storm surge will come ashore, especially just ahead and south of the storm’s center, similar again to what occurred during Ian.

As the storm moves inland, the wind will change direction, and since the slope of the sea surface changes with the wind, some portions of the bay will get inundated first, and then later, other portions of the bay will.

The surge is a complicated evolution based on the actual geometry of the body of water it encounters.

“That’s why you really can’t generalize a storm surge from one region to another,” Dr. Weisberg said.

Complicating factors with forecasting this surge will not only be the path the storm takes and its predicted irregular shape. But as the storm approaches landfall, it will most likely encounter turbulent air that will reduce the storm’s intensity but also make it less symmetric. So exactly what wind will blow where is unknown right now.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,commentary,1,0,2,-0.6128,[],"['Tampa', 'Naples', 'Florida', 'Clearwater', 'Milton']"
871,2024-09-27,A Huge Hurricane,"Hurricane Helene slammed into Florida’s Gulf Coast as a Category 4 storm with winds of 140 miles an hour. It swallowed parts of Florida in a nine-foot storm surge, lashed the region with heavy rain and has cut power for millions of people. It is now in Georgia, where it is weakening to a tropical storm. You can track it here.

Helene is the most powerful hurricane ever to strike Florida’s Big Bend region, where the state’s long peninsula curves to meet its Panhandle. The storm is huge, and it is expected to damage much of the southeast. President Biden approved disaster declarations for Alabama, North Carolina and South Carolina, in addition to Florida and Georgia.

Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor, said that one person had died from the storm but that there would likely be others. Brian Kemp, Georgia’s governor, said that a tornado there had killed two people, and one person died in North Carolina.

872,2024-10-02,Sleeping Through Hurricane Helene,"Across the country, as many as six million more homes are at severe risk of flooding than are even included on the federal government’s flood risk maps, Michael Thomas pointed out in the aftermath of the storm. Across Asheville’s Buncombe County, 17 times as many homes had been judged at risk in a 100-year flood event as carried insurance against that risk; Helene was called a thousand-year flood for certain parts of the Southeast, though those terms grow less meaningful almost by the day. Another ostensible thousand-year storm had hit the coastal Carolinas just one week before. “Sometimes ‘worst case’ scenarios really do come to pass,” the climate scientist Daniel Swain wrote over the weekend on Sunday, “and I think we often lack the collective imagination to fully envision what that looks like.”

Americans watching disaster footage from a distance — collapsed bridges and disappeared roads, Asheville submerged by sludgy brown floodwater — wondered how hurricanes might produce such devastation, so far from shore and so high up in the mountains. They used the words “unprecedented” and “unthinkable” and grimly recalled silly rankings of so-called climate havens, often produced in partnership with real estate brokers, which named Asheville as a top choice destination for those seeking safety from extreme weather. In conversation and on social media they suggested, as they had with floods in Vermont and orange skies in New York last summer, that the lesson of Helene is that nowhere is safe from climate disaster; an essay bearing that headline, published in Politico, was presented by Chevron. The real lesson may not be quite so grim, though it also demands more of us: To the extent we might enjoy safety and stability in a world evermore pockmarked by climate impacts, it won’t be because we casually circled havens on maps but because we built and designed them ourselves.

Helene gives one vision of the future, with the storm scarring a whole region and imposing perhaps a decade of recovery. But in truth, as extraordinary as its devastation might seem, this kind of flooding in this kind of setting was not unthinkable or, for that matter, even unprecedented. Indeed, it happened in western North Carolina in 1916, and Hurricanes Camille (1969) and Agnes (1972) offered additional cautionary tales. For those with foreshortened memories, there was similarly spectacular flooding, nearly simultaneously, in Kathmandu, Nepal, on the other side of the planet, where nearly 150 have died and landslides have flattened whole neighborhoods after half a year’s rain fell in two days in a city twice as high up in the mountains and twice as far from the coast as Asheville.

These days, even ubiquitous news stories produce some amount of lamentation that nobody is covering this, since everyone loves to post media criticism and in an endless scroll it’s easy enough to find sufficient straw men. (We hear a lot about social media’s echo chamber, but its greatest trick is showing you stuff to get outraged about, including the apparent indifference or lack of interest of others.)

At first, over the weekend, word of Helene’s devastation crisscrossed the country almost by whisper, in part because the few in position to observe the greatest damage firsthand lacked cellular and internet connections with which to transmit their pictures and in part because national media hadn’t quite anticipated the scale of destruction and local media, though heroic, was only capable of so much.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.8553,"['Nepal', 'United States']","['New York', 'Asheville', 'Kathmandu']"
873,2024-10-07,Tampa Residents Warned to Expect ‘Worst Hurricane in Their Lifetime’,"In October 1921, when the population was only about 120,000, the Tampa Bay area was hit by a Category 3 storm that shredded fishing piers and smashed steamships into docks. The storm submerged railroad cars and leveled trees and utility poles. Eight people died in the storm, nearly half drowned by the storm surge that inundated the shoreline.

Mr. Davis said Tampa Bay was also hit by three major storms in the 1800s, including a hurricane known as the Great Gale of 1848. That one destroyed nearly all the buildings in the area, which was then little more than a settlement of several hundred people near a military outpost, Fort Brooke.

Timing is critical, Mr. Davis said.

“This is the time of year where the tracks have a higher chance of hitting the Tampa Bay region from the Gulf of Mexico,” he said. “The previous storms that hit Tampa did just this. They formed in the Western Gulf and they went almost straight east into parts of the Florida peninsula, right around Tampa Bay.”

The 1921 storm struck in late October; the storm in 1848, in late September.

Hurricane Milton, which rapidly intensified in the Gulf of Mexico on Monday, becoming a Category 5 storm, is expected to make landfall somewhere near Tampa as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday, according to the Weather Service.

Like in 1921, the storm surge is expected to be 10 to 15 feet. The surge could be more damaging because of Hurricane Helene, which damaged barrier islands and wiped out sand dunes and beaches when it swept through last month. “Just after our latest hurricane, we are extremely vulnerable, especially to surge,” Mr. Davis said.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.9322,['Mexico'],"['Tampa', 'Davis', 'Florida']"

And the biggest satisfaction is that we can help a city rebuild.”

Mr. Lopez said he planned to ride out Hurricane Milton in Florida and would very likely remain there to assist in the recovery. The storm roared back to Category 5 strength on Tuesday afternoon, and the Tampa Bay region was bracing for what could be its first direct hit from a major storm since the 1920s.

879,2024-10-04,A Once-Dormant Hurricane Season Is Spinning Into Action,"October and November typically calm down slightly. When graphed, an average season looks like a tall mountain with a solid peak of activity at the beginning of September. But seasonal hurricane experts like Phil Klotzbach at Colorado State University believe this year will instead bring three hurricane seasons: “A busy start, a super-quiet peak and a busy finish,” he said. When graphed, this season will look like two mountain peaks with a distinct valley in the center.

In early July, Hurricane Beryl, the earliest major hurricane to form in a season, was the first hurricane to land in the United States, lashing Houston with damaging winds and bringing warnings of what was to come this season. Then came Debby, which flooded Florida, Georgia and the Carolina coasts in early August. Then, after Hurricane Ernesto, the Atlantic went quiet. There was nothing for weeks at what was supposed to be the height of the season. Forecasters who had warned of the worst began questioning their expectations and looking for explanations for the lull.

Scientists are already trying to diagnose what happened, in hopes of informing future forecasts and better preparing coastal residents. One possible explanation is that the African Monsoon, a weather pattern that can spin up storms off Africa’s west coast, was too far north. Instead of moving over warm tropical water, this year’s storms hit cooler conditions that were less conducive to helping them form. Another hypothesis is that the air was too warm at higher levels, which meant that the already warmer air at the surface of the ocean couldn’t rise up to form thunderstorms.

Then, almost overnight, just after the midpoint of hurricane season in mid-September, the lull broke. Francine formed and hit Louisiana, and not far behind it were more: Gordon, Kirk and Leslie, which churned generally harmlessly in the middle of the Atlantic.

See the Ocean Heat Fueling Hurricane Milton, in One Chart

The energy that supercharged Hurricane Milton into a Category 5 storm on Monday came from the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, which have been abnormally warm not just at the surface, but at depth, too.

For a year and a half now, the upper layer of the world’s oceans has been at or near its hottest temperatures on record. The seas absorb most of the extra heat that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap near Earth’s surface. So the same human-caused forces that have been bringing abnormal heat to towns, cities and landscapes are helping to warm the oceans.

The regions of the Atlantic where hurricanes tend to form have been no exception. Ocean heat content is a metric that captures the amount of thermal energy stored from the sea surface down through the ocean depths.

When the seas are warm, more water evaporates at the surface. Storms drag this humid air aloft, where it condenses into clouds and rain. This releases heat that helps draw even more air skyward, allowing storms to strengthen and grow.

Record ocean warmth is one reason forecasters began saying months ago that they expected this year’s hurricane season to be “hyperactive.” Storms that traverse particularly hot spots are more likely to intensify rapidly, as Milton did on Monday and Hurricane Helene did last month before killing more than 230 people across the Southeast.

How did two powerful hurricanes spin up in the Gulf of Mexico in such quick succession? Typically, storms’ ferocious winds churn up the ocean’s cooler, deeper waters, helping bring down the temperature at the surface somewhat.

Helene very likely did this too, though scientists have been unable to retrieve some of the latest data on sea-surface temperatures because Helene knocked out a key federal facility, the National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, N.C.

Crucially, though, Milton gained strength over the western Gulf, whereas Helene did so over the eastern Gulf. That means they tapped separate sources of ocean energy, said Kim Wood, an associate professor of hydrology and atmospheric sciences at the University of Arizona.

For scientists, this hurricane season has been staggering to witness. “It’s felt like an entire hurricane season has taken place over the past few weeks,” Dr. Wood said.

It would be the fifth to make landfall somewhere along the Gulf Coast of the United States this year.

There have been nine hurricanes in this year’s Atlantic season, and four others have hit the Gulf Coast, prompting evacuation orders from Texas to Florida and devastating coastal communities.

September: Hurricane Helene

Hurricane Helene was the strongest storm to ever hit Florida’s Big Bend region, and it did so as a Category 4 hurricane with 140-mile-per-hour winds and record-breaking storm surges late September. It carved a path of destruction through the southeastern United States and has left over 200 people dead across six states. Countless other are still missing.

It devastated the mountainous region between western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee, where floodwaters washed away homes and roads and isolated entire communities for days.

Thousands of federal, state and National Guard workers have descended on the region to help with hurricane recovery, and Mr. Cooper said that some progress has been made. Rattling through the latest statistics, he said that there were just under 13,000 reported power outages, compared with one million in the immediate aftermath of the storm. About 580 roads remain closed, down from about 1,200.

But the governor acknowledged the enormousness of the challenges ahead, including ensuring that people who lost their homes and belongings to floodwaters are taken care of as cold weather starts to seep into the state. Asheville and other communities still face some difficulty when it comes to the restoration of running water, he said.

Mr. Cooper also spent part of the news briefing castigating the spread of misinformation and falsehoods about the storm response, ranging from false claims about the Federal Emergency Management Agency seizing local land to misinformation about the aid available to survivors of the storm.

More than 40 people were reported dead in four states as the huge storm spawned flash floods and landslides on its way north.

In the densely populated Tampa Bay region of Florida, neighborhoods were underwater on Friday, the result of a powerful storm surge. In southern Georgia, search teams pulled trapped residents, some with injuries, out of damaged buildings. More than two million people in North Carolina were under flood warnings, and millions, including some as far north as Virginia, were without power.

The destruction stretched at least 800 miles north from where the storm came ashore in a sparsely populated area of Florida called the Big Bend, which sits in the crook of coastline where the Panhandle connects to the Florida peninsula.

Near the town of Newport, Tenn., concerns about a potential dam collapse triggered a flash flood warning for 20,000 people and led officials to order many in the 7,000-person community to evacuate.

888,2024-09-26,What Does a Hurricane’s Category Tell Us?,"When a hurricane threatens land, one of the top questions on people’s minds is what category is it, and that’s for good reason. Hurricanes are categorized by their wind speeds on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, which provides useful information on the storm’s winds, their expected impact and potential damage.

Hurricane Helene was nearing the coast of Florida as a Category 3 storm on Thursday evening and was expected to make landfall as a Category 4.

Hurricanes are split into five categories based on the wind speeds they generate:

Category 1: winds between 74 miles per hour and 95 m.p.h. These are considered “very dangerous winds” that will cause some damage, even tearing the roofs of “well-constructed frame homes,” and taking shingles, vinyl siding and gutters, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Category 2: winds between 96 m.p.h. and 110 m.p.h. Hurricanes at this level carry “extremely dangerous winds” that will cause vast damage, including major damage to roofs and siding and uprooting trees. A near-total loss of power is expected.

Category 3: winds between 111 m.p.h. and 129 m.p.h. This is the level at which a hurricane is considered “major,” according to the Hurricane Center, and its wind speeds indicate that “devastating damage will occur.” Homes might see major damage, such as the removal of roof decking and gable ends. Snapped or uprooted trees might block roads, while electricity and water will likely be unavailable for days or even weeks.

Category 4: winds between 130 m.p.h. and 156 m.p.h. Catastrophic damage is expected, with homes sustaining severe damage that can include losing their roofs and some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles will be downed, causing residential areas to become isolated, according to the Hurricane Center. Power outages are expected to last weeks or even months, and most of the area will be uninhabitable for that period.

Category 5: winds of 157 m.p.h. and greater. At this point, “a high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse,” according to the Hurricane Center. There will be fallen trees and downed power poles, isolating residential areas with power outages lasting for weeks or months. As with a Category 4, most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.

This is the third storm since Ian to cause damage along Florida’s southwest Gulf Coast, said Mayor Dan Allers of Fort Myers Beach, and each one hampers recovery. Helene, he said, created as much mess as Hurricanes Debby and Idalia, which hit this August and last August, combined. Storm surge was recorded at about six feet, and it deposited sand mounds as high as three feet along Estero Boulevard, the main road spanning the seven-mile island.

City crews planned to spend the next several days clearing roads. A Hurricane Ian “Remembrance and Resiliency Ceremony” that was scheduled for Saturday was canceled as the town once again focuses on recovery. Mr. Allers said he’s also looking into sewage problems, which residents from two areas of the island had reported.

“It feels like whenever you start making good momentum, you’re pushed backward,” he lamented. Even so, he said, the damage was nowhere near that from Hurricane Ian, which swept homes and businesses out to sea.

There were no evacuation orders issued in Lee County, as the predicted surge was not life-threatening. Still, Ms. Weber said many of her neighbors left out of precaution, the harrowing memories of drownings still fresh.

Western North Carolina experienced a historic disaster.

Pounding rain, flash floods and dangerous landslides savaged the area around Asheville in western North Carolina, putting the region in crisis. “It’s like a mini-apocalypse,” said Gretchen Hogan, a resident of Brevard, N.C.

So many roads were severed by washouts, mudslides or toppled trees and other debris that many towns were completely cut off. Cellphone service and electric power were down in many areas, complicating officials’ efforts to reach people calling 911.

In all, there were hundreds of road closures in the region, including blockages of two main highways, Interstate 40 and Interstate 26. Officials told residents to consider all roads in western North Carolina closed, with only emergency rescue vehicles allowed to travel.

As crews began the monumental task of trying to clear blocked roads, the state, with assistance from search-and-rescue teams from other states and the federal government, began airlifting food and other supplies to isolated communities and sending workers to begin restoring water systems.

Evacuation orders extended south along the coast, where Hurricane Ian made landfall in 2022, killing about 150 people.

Milton, which formed as a tropical storm on Saturday afternoon, rapidly intensified from a Category 1 to a Category 5 hurricane over a few hours on Monday morning. Forecasters expect it to weaken somewhat before making landfall somewhere between Naples and Cedar Key, with possible storm surge of up to 12 feet.

What comes out of the tap is often yellow or brown, and while it can be used to flush toilets and take showers, it is still unsafe for human consumption. Officials have given no indication of when the water will be safe to drink again, and the reservoir that feeds the system still looks like it is filled with chocolate milk rather than pristine water.

Obtaining clean water remains a daily concern for many residents, who head to disaster relief sites to bathe, do their laundry and pick up bottles of drinking water. Large canisters stocked with well water dot some neighborhoods. Many restaurants and breweries that lack a clean water source remain closed.

By The New York Times

Kristy is the 11th named storm to form in the Eastern Pacific in 2024.

Storms that form in the Atlantic or the Pacific generally move west, meaning Atlantic storms pose a greater threat to North America. If a storm forms in the Pacific close to land, it can bring damaging winds and rain before pushing out to sea.

However, an air mass can sometimes block a storm, driving it north or northeast toward the Baja California peninsula and the west coast of Mexico. Occasionally, a storm can move farther north, as Hurricane Hilary did last year, bringing damaging winds and intense rain to Southern California.

Hurricane season in the Eastern Pacific began on May 15, two weeks before the Atlantic season started. Both seasons run through Nov. 30.

Another factor for storm-watchers this year is the likely development of La Niña, the intermittent, large-scale atmospheric pattern that can affect weather worldwide.

In the Pacific Ocean, La Niña increases wind shear, which is a change in wind speed and/or direction with height. Those changes make it more difficult for storms to form. (In the Atlantic, La Niña has the opposite effect, reducing wind shear and increasing the chances for storm formation.)",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.5413,"['Mexico', 'Belize']","['Leer', 'New York']"

What Happened?,"Halfway through an Atlantic hurricane season that forecasters expected would be one of the most active on record, there has been a considerable interlude in storms during what is typically the busiest portion of the season, leaving observers to wonder if the forecast was a bust — or if the worst may be yet to come.

Often, at this time of the year, it isn’t uncommon to see two, three or even four named storms occurring simultaneously. But on Wednesday there were no current storms, and there hasn’t been one since Hurricane Ernesto formed, beginning as a tropical storm, on Aug. 12. A quiet spell this significant has not been seen during this part of the season since 1968, according to Phil Klotzbach, a researcher of hurricane activity at Colorado State University.

Dr. Klotzbach — whose team predicted in April that there would be 23 named storms this year — joked that when the season ends in November, he may be eating crow for dinner.

904,2024-09-27,I’ve Lived With Hurricanes for Years. The Decisions Keep Getting Harder.,"As the tropical disturbance that became Hurricane Helene moved north toward Florida’s Gulf Coast on Tuesday, I had an argument with myself about evacuating from Tallahassee: If I ran from the storm, would I get caught up in it anyway? I was thinking of Charlize Theron’s character in the movie “Prometheus,” crushed by a spaceship that crashed while she ran in a straight line away from it.

Stricken by the thought of being trapped (or worse) in my house by falling trees, I decided to drive to Greenville, S.C., with my elderly cat, but not without extreme anxiety. Many Floridians like me who were not under mandatory evacuation orders remember Hurricane Michael in 2018 and other recent unpredictable, dangerous hurricanes. For us, decisions about whether to stay or leave and where to go have become more tortuous in ways that may be difficult to understand for those who don’t experience hurricanes regularly.

Many don’t have the resources to flee monstrous storms such as Helene. But for those who can evacuate, there is a sense of not being able to outrun them or that the destinations may become just as perilous. Every possibility feels both right and wrong and also like disaster deferred for only days — while dithering only shrinks the window for escape.

This time, many of my Tallahassee friends who previously hunkered down left the city, driven as much by the cumulative effect of anxiety and exhaustion as by the particular threats of Helene.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,0,-0.9786,['United States'],"['Tallahassee', 'Florida', 'Greenville']"

All times on the map are Eastern. By The New York Times

What does the storm look like from above?

Satellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.

By The New York Times

Oscar is the 15th named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.9845,['United States'],['New York']

And what is the difference between hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones?","The terms hurricane, typhoon and cyclone all refer to tropical cyclones — circular storms that form over warm waters, with very low air pressure at the center and winds greater than 74 miles per hour. But different terms are used for such storms in different parts of the world.

A hurricane forms in the North Atlantic, the northeastern Pacific, the Caribbean Sea or the Gulf of Mexico.

A typhoon develops in the northwestern Pacific and usually affects Asia.

The international date line serves as the Pacific Ocean’s dividing marker, so when a hurricane crosses it from east to west, it becomes a typhoon, and vice versa.

The same kinds of storms in the Southern Hemisphere have different labels:

A tropical cyclone forms in the southern Indian Ocean or the South Pacific. (Remember, tropical cyclone is also the umbrella term for all these storms.)

A cyclone forms in the Bay of Bengal or Arabian Sea, both in the northern Indian Ocean.

As violent as they are, these storms help regulate the global climate by moving heat away from the tropics and toward the poles.

Aside from having different names, hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones have different seasons. The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. The Pacific season starts slightly earlier. Typhoons can form year-round but are most common from May to October.

In the southern Indian Ocean, the season begins two weeks later and ends at the same time, except in the island nations of Mauritius and the Seychelles, where it begins May 15.

Debby is certainly loaded with a lot of water. One big reason: The waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean have been abnormally hot for months. This warmth causes more of the water to evaporate, providing storms with more moisture to unleash as rain. The extra heat in the ocean also gives storms more energy with which they could potentially generate stronger winds.

But other factors stopped Debby’s winds from intensifying to the highest levels, said Kim Wood, an associate professor of hydrology and atmospheric sciences at the University of Arizona. Before making landfall in Florida this week, the storm crossed Cuba, where the mountainous terrain very likely disrupted the low-level winds that channel energy from the sea surface into the storm.

“The water was plenty warm, but the storm itself had to be organized,” Dr. Wood said.

Follow our live coverage here.

Idalia’s path, which is expected to run parallel to Florida’s western coast for much of Tuesday, makes it difficult to predict exactly where the storm would come ashore: A little wobble to the east or the west could move its center toward Tallahassee to the north or Tampa to the south.

My colleagues and I on The Times’s Weather desk just redesigned our hurricane tracker with detailed information about the storm’s path and severity.

In today’s newsletter, I’m going to tell you how best to track a hurricane’s progress, especially if you’re in its path. I have nearly two decades of experience covering natural disasters like these, and there are a few things I’ve learned:

Don’t focus too much on the center of the storm: Many people look only at the “cone of uncertainty” — the familiar map that shows the likely path of the hurricane’s eye. But people often misinterpret these maps, thinking they’ll be safe if they live just outside the cone, for example. (See this 2019 article from Times Opinion for more.) Nearly a year ago, officials in Florida’s Lee County saw they were on the edge of the cone of uncertainty for Hurricane Ian and delayed an order to evacuate, with devastating consequences.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.34,['Mexico'],"['Tallahassee', 'Tampa', 'Florida']"
917,2022-06-29,What is the eye of a hurricane?,"Hurricanes are made up of three parts:

Rain bands, which are curved bands of clouds and thunderstorms that spiral away from the center

The eyewall, which is a ring of cumulonimbus clouds where the strongest winds are found

The eye, which is the hurricane’s center

The eye of a storm is a circular area where there are winds of up to 15 miles per hour, relatively weak compared with the stronger winds of the rest of the storm. It is completely or partially surrounded by the eyewall, which is a ring of cumulonimbus clouds, the National Hurricane Center said. An eye can be up to 120 miles in diameter, but most are 20 to 40 miles across, said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist for the center.

A hurricane’s eyewall usually develops when winds reach 74 miles per hour, or Category 1 status. According to Mr. Feltgen, the eyewall is a ring of deep convection — the vertical movement of heat and moisture in the atmosphere — bordering the eye of the storm. “This area has the highest surface winds in a tropical cyclone,” Mr. Feltgen said. “Because air in the eye is slowly sinking, it creates an updraft in the eyewall.” He added, “The eye is the region of the lowest pressure at the surface and the warmest temperatures at the top.”

Inside the eye of the storm is calm weather, and sometimes the sun can be seen. If a particular area is experiencing the eye, the hurricane is only halfway over that area, said Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the department of atmospheric science at Colorado State University. “The back side of the hurricane can pack similar threats to the front side of the hurricane, including strong winds and heavy rain,” he said. “Depending on your position relative to various bodies of water, you can also get additional storm surge on the back side of the hurricane too.”

In strong storms, an eyewall replacement cycle can occur, Mr. Feltgen said. This happens when a storm reaches its peak intensity and the eye contracts to a smaller size, sometimes as small as five miles in diameter. Strong rain bands in the outer edges of the storm move inward toward the eye, taking moisture and momentum from the inner eyewall, weakening the system.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,0,0,0,0.9169,[],[]

It may weaken as it moves across the southeastern United States on Thursday.

Parts of Louisiana are still clawing their way back from recent storms, including Hurricane Laura in late August and Hurricane Delta earlier this month. Officials in New Orleans worry that Zeta, the fifth named storm to strike the state this year, will not skirt past their city like the others.

Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana strained on Tuesday to telegraph the gravity of the threat, urging residents to brace themselves.

“It’s easy to let your guard down late in the hurricane season,” he said, “but that would be a huge mistake.”",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,0,-0.6262,"['United States', 'Mexico']",['New Orleans']

From “The New York Times,” I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” [MUSIC PLAYING] Today, Hurricane Otis, which killed more than two dozen people in Southern Mexico this week, has revealed a new kind of threat that meteorologists fear will become more and more common, a severe hurricane that arrives with shockingly little warning or time to prepare. My colleague, Judson Jones explains. It’s Friday, October 27. Judson, we’re coming to you because you are a meteorologist on the staff of “The Times,” which is a pretty new development, I have to think, because I didn’t actually know that “The Times” had a meteorologist on our staff.

judson jones

So I came on about a year ago, last Halloween. And it all came about because “The Times” wanted to develop an extreme weather team. We often say extreme weather is the fingerprint of climate change. So a lot of times, it’s the evidence that the world is changing. And so by bringing on a meteorologist and a data journalism team, my team is responsible for diving into the data of these extremes.

michael barbaro

Got it. So the reality that climate change and extreme weather are deeply interwoven is why you are at “The Times.”

judson jones

Absolutely.

michael barbaro

Well, let’s turn to the reason we’re talking to you right now, which is an extreme weather event that happened just a couple of days ago, Hurricane Otis and why it felt so different to those of us watching it than most hurricanes.

judson jones

What made Otis so remarkable and scary was that it rapidly intensified from a tropical storm Tuesday morning to a category five 5 hurricane by nightfall.

michael barbaro

Basically, it went from your run of the mill storm to the most terrifying, powerful, destructive kind of hurricane in less than 24 hours.

judson jones

Yeah, I mean, it was the ultimate nightmare scenario.

michael barbaro

So tell us the full story of Otis from the beginning, from your perspective as somebody watching it.

judson jones

Well, in full transparency on Wednesday morning, I woke up and went, what happened? Like, normally, we have a lot of lead up time to hurricanes. Like, we’re tracking them across the Atlantic Ocean, or we’re tracking them across the Pacific Ocean. You can see them coming. It gives the forecast models time to initialize and give different results over a couple of days, so there’s this chance to understand that the storm is coming here. This storm —

reporter (on recording)

Otis is new to the scene in the Eastern Pacific. This is a tropical storm.

judson jones

— formed on Sunday. It was 40 miles per hour.

reporter (on recording)

Otis is pushing its way towards Acapulco, so we’re going to see some very heavy rain around the Southwest of Mexico.

judson jones

On Monday, it was 50 miles per hour. The forecast models weren’t really showing it intensifying at all.

reporter (on recording)

Tropical storm Otis continues to spin in the Eastern Pacific winds right now. [MUSIC PLAYING]

judson jones

Tuesday morning, it was still a tropical storm, so around 50 miles per hour. But by midday, it was 80 miles per hour. It was a category one hurricane strength. It started to look even more like a hurricane on satellite, which kind of gives an indication that it’s intensifying. An eye started to form.

reporter (on recording)

Now let’s talk about this one in the Pacific. This thing just jumped up just to a category three.

judson jones

And then that afternoon, hurricane hunters flew through the eye twice and found that it was actually a category four strength hurricane.

reporter (on recording)

Now we go to a potentially dangerous situation developing in Mexico. A rapidly intensifying hurricane is making its way toward the resort community of Acapulco.

judson jones

And then later that night, all of a sudden, it was 165 miles per hour, the strongest storm that has ever hit the West Coast of Mexico. [MUSIC PLAYING]

michael barbaro

So every hour, or every two hours, this thing is becoming an entire order of magnitude bigger. And that’s just not, you’re saying, normal.

judson jones

It was one of the fastest strengthening storms we’ve ever experienced. It is beyond the definition of rapid intensification. The typical definition is 35 miles per hour in 24 hours. This one went above 100 miles per hour in 24 hours. Like, it jumped from a tropical storm to a category five. I mean, it’s just —

michael barbaro

Unheard of.

judson jones

It’s remarkable in meteorology terms.

michael barbaro

OK. So when this very anomalously intensifying storm arrives on the Western Coast of Mexico as a category five storm, describe for us what happens, given the fact that from everything you’re saying, there hasn’t been very much time at all to prepare.

judson jones

The winds came in howling. I mean, they were ripping off palm leaves. And you can see it in video before all the power cut off. Then all of a sudden, these tourists and the residents — nearly a million people live in the city had broken shattered windows. [MAN SPEAKING SPANISH] The sides of buildings were starting to rip off. You can see the rain coming into people’s bedrooms where they’re trying to sleep. I mean, this came in normally when people would be sleeping.

michael barbaro

Right. I think I remember 1:00 AM local time or so.

judson jones

Yeah. I mean, you just imagine — you think you’re just going to sleep through the storm. And then all of a sudden, the windows are just being shattered. [WIND HOWLING] And by the time the sun came up, cell towers were down. Internet was down. It was really difficult to find out what was going on the ground. But we know now that the damage was extensive. 27 people have died, and more are still missing.

michael barbaro

Which really would seem to highlight the problem of rapid intensification. You don’t have time to evacuate people, and therefore, more people die.

judson jones

Yeah. In this modern age where you expect forecast and people to be able to evacuate, we never want to see anyone die in these storms. As meteorologists, that’s why we forecast. It’s to save lives. And so it just goes back to the ferociousness of this storm.

michael barbaro

Just how unusual is Hurricane Otis, given everything you’ve just described, which makes it feel very unusual?

judson jones

Not as unusual as we hope. I’m afraid that we’re going to see this happen more frequently. Studies are showing that rapid intensification is happening more often. I think that’s the future we need to prepare for. [MUSIC PLAYING]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Judson, what is the evidence that storms like Otis that intensify in what feels like lightning speed with so little warning are now becoming more common and are not as unusual as you would like them to be?

judson jones

It’s one of the things that you can actually attribute to climate change a little bit. There are studies that have shown that typhoons and cyclones, which are just hurricanes in another ocean basin, that they’re rapidly intensifying more frequently. Even a study just a couple of weeks ago that focused specifically on hurricanes in The Atlantic showed that in a warming world, rapid intensification is twice as likely to happen.

michael barbaro

So essentially, the thing that tells us that this is becoming more common is people studying old storms and saying there’s no denying this reality.

judson jones

Yeah. I mean, even the storms I’ve covered over the last decade kind of used to feel like something we would occasionally say. This storm is going to rapidly intensify, or that storm just rapidly intensified. And now it almost feels like every storm we cover is just another indication.

michael barbaro

Right. And I want you to just mechanically explain why this intensification is happening. Clearly, the main driving factor is warming water temperatures. But I want you to just remind us how that works and how a warmer body of water means that a small storm is becoming a massive destructive storm so quickly.

judson jones

Well, to have a hurricane, you need to have warm water. It has to be 80 degrees Fahrenheit or higher to really give it the energy that it needs. So think of a hurricane as like an engine. and that energy, that warm water, is the fuel that’s fueling the hurricane. Typically, these storms, if they sit over an ocean in an area for a long period of time, they continue to pull that energy up into the hurricane. But down below, colder water starts upwelling, so the hurricane is pulling colder water that’s replacing that warm water. But what we’re seeing in this warming world is that it’s not just the ocean surface temperatures that are warming. The column of water is warming. So instead of pulling colder water up into the hurricane, it’s upwelling warmer water that is, again, above 80 degrees, which gives more energy to the storm so instead of a hurricane just kind of petering out because it’s lost that fuel. Instead, it’s pulling more energy into that storm.

michael barbaro

That’s fascinating. So when there’s more and more fuel in the ocean for the hurricane, the chances of it speeding up become higher and higher. The chances of it petering out becomes smaller and smaller.

judson jones

Yeah. That’s exactly right.

michael barbaro

So if you’re a meteorologist, which you are, how does this new reality of there being so much warm water fuel for these storms to intensify? How does that change your role in warning people about these dangerous storms?

judson jones

It’s almost like we turned back the clock a little bit on forecasting. We’ve come a long way in meteorology. If you think back to the great Galveston hurricane in 1900, they didn’t have warning. And then the satellite era came, and all of a sudden, we could see these storms in The Atlantic. And we knew that they were going to move towards the US. So we’ve constantly been improving. Forecast models have even gotten better. We have this ability to see a storm out in The Atlantic and say, hey, that may hit the US in two weeks. However, when you have this rapid intensification equation, this problem that kind of inserts itself, it kind of changes the game.

michael barbaro

Right. It kind of undermines all that technology and says to it, you’re not up to the task.

judson jones

Yeah. And I mean, I think scientists are quickly trying to develop better models to predict this intensity because it is a scary thing. I mean, we want to warn people. And it helps to be able to see in the future.

michael barbaro

Well, what would help you adjust to this pretty scary new reality about faster intensifying storms? What would help you be able to predict that Otis was going to do what it ultimately did? Are there some straight forward easy solutions to that?

judson jones

I think one thing is better observations. I think we’re getting in an age where we’re launching weather satellites all over the place. And that’s helping improve our forecasts. Having a better understanding of just how intense the storm is ahead of time is key. But even in this situation, it took a hurricane hunter flying through the storm to really know how intense it was. So I think that’s one thing. But the other thing is the forecast, these super computers that are trying to predict the future. We need to continue to develop that science. For example, if we had more sensors in the Pacific Ocean, we could get better data and understand what is actually coming from the West to the East or from the East to the West, depending on what part of the Pacific Ocean you’re in. If we get more data, the forecasts are going to get better.

michael barbaro

OK, but even if we get more sensors in the Pacific Ocean and even if we get better forecasts and better warnings on these more quickly intensifying storms, that doesn’t solve the problem of helping people on land to prepare when by definition, they just have less and less time, given the warming water. So how are we supposed to solve for that? I mean, the straightforward answer would seem to be we need to cut back on emissions, which is clearly a root cause of these warming temperatures creating these nightmare scenarios. But even if we did that, that would take time. So what do we do now? If you live in a coastal community and you’re getting less and less time to prepare for a hurricane, what can be done?

judson jones

A lot of it ends up coming down to mitigation. It comes down to as simple as building materials. There are things called hurricane ties that you can get for a few bucks to hold down your roof to the rest of the framework of your house, so the roof doesn’t blow off. There are things that can be done to help mitigate that disaster. Another thing is not building in flood plains. We’re seeing a lot more of that. But then it’s also having shelters readily available that are hurricane proof or tornado proof. There are things that cities, and towns, and countries can do to help mitigate the disaster by giving people options if they’re in the path of a major storm.

michael barbaro

Right, options that increasingly, perhaps, need to acknowledge that there might not be time to get in your car and drive for hours and hours, but are contingency plans that, perhaps, recognize that you may end up needing to stay in your community when one of these storms very rapidly becomes something super dangerous.

judson jones

Absolutely.

michael barbaro

I’m curious, just thinking about the fact that you are a meteorologist, if this situation we’re describing makes you feel an immense amount of pressure to get things righter than ever before — I mean, there’s always lots of carping when a meteorologist gets something wrong. You told us to worry about a storm. It passed us. We’re annoyed with you. But the burden now feels even more intense because if you’re wrong, the amount of time, the room for error is vanishingly small. And the danger is so much greater. And that puts you in a very tricky position.

judson jones

Yeah. I mean, meteorologists have always gotten it wrong. That’s why it’s a joke, because it’s a science. Meteorologists, what they’re doing is creating a hypothesis. So when they’re forecasting, when a meteorologist, like myself, is giving you a forecast, they’re giving their best educated guess based off of everything that’s happening around. So as I write these stories and trying to forecast these bigger storms, being right is not easy. [MUSIC PLAYING] I feel responsible for what people may think by reading those words like, should they evacuate? Should they not evacuate? Is this storm actually going to be a big deal? And I carry a lot of that weight on my shoulders. And in this world where storms can intensify and kind of come out of nowhere, it’s not the kind of storm I like to wake up to the next morning and go, oh, I should have covered this two days ago, so people had more warning.

michael barbaro

Right.

judson jones

I want to be able to warn people three or four days in advance of a major hurricane. And when they rapidly intensify next to a city with nearly a million people, that is the worst nightmare.

michael barbaro

Judson, thank you very much. We really appreciate it.

judson jones

Thanks for having me, Michael.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] Here’s what else you need to know today. A massive manhunt entered its second day in Maine, where police were searching for the gunman who killed at least 18 people at a restaurant and bowling alley in America’s deadliest shooting of the year. Police described the suspect as a sergeant first class in the Army Reserve, where his superiors became alarmed over statements he had made over the summer, threatening his own unit.

All Maine people are sharing in the sorrow of the families who lost loved ones last night, loved ones, normal people who were killed or injured while unwinding from a day of work or while spending time with their family and friends socializing.

During a news conference, Maine’s Governor Janet Mills called the shooting a dark day for the state and for the city where it occurred.

And on Thursday, the Israeli military said it had briefly sent tanks into Northern Gaza in preparation for its next stage of fighting, which could involve a ground invasion. In Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry said that the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli airstrikes has surpassed 7,000 people. But those numbers cannot be independently verified and have been questioned by President Biden. In response, Hamas released what it said were the names of 6,747 people who had died.

929,2020-07-30,Hurricane Isaias Forms in the Atlantic,"Emergency managers this year have been wary of what might happen if a major hurricane strikes during the coronavirus pandemic. Evacuation orders often put people in close contact with one another in shelters, which would make maintaining social distancing and other safety measures against the virus difficult to maintain.

Over the weekend, officials in Hawaii worried that space at shelters could be limited because of social distancing policies if Hurricane Douglas hit the islands grimly. The American Red Cross also faced obstacles recruiting volunteers to run the state’s shelters because of anxieties surrounding exposure to the coronavirus.

Last week, Hanna hit the southern coastal region of Texas as a Category 1 hurricane, taking aim at some of the same communities that have seen a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. As the storm neared the coast, the mayor of Corpus Christi urged people who had taken in relatives to wear masks in their homes; San Antonio opened a reception center for people who had fled their homes, where officials handed out vouchers for hotel rooms.

The Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 through Nov. 30, has been a busy one. The first tropical storm was Arthur, which formed off the coast of Florida in May, followed by Bertha, which made landfall near Charleston, S.C., later that month. The systems made 2020 the sixth year in a row that a storm developed before the official start of the season.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted an above normal Atlantic hurricane season, with as many as 19 named storms — of which six to 10 could become hurricanes.

The storms began before the hurricane season officially kicked off, with the formation of Tropical Storm Albert in mid-May, two weeks before the official start of the Atlantic season on June 1.

In August, midway through the six-month season, scientists upgraded their outlook to say 2020 would be “one of the most active seasons,” and said they expected up to 25 named storms by the time it was over. By November, even that upgraded expectation was exceeded: There have now been 30 named storms — 13 of them hurricanes — breaking a record set in 2005, when 28 storms grew strong enough to be named. Fifteen that year became hurricanes.

The latest storm, Hurricane Iota, made landfall late Monday in Central America, a region still recovering after a hit from Hurricane Eta two weeks ago.

This season’s third hurricane, Idalia, formed on Aug. 29, 10 days earlier than average. It struck the southeastern U.S. last week as a Category 3 hurricane and caused a dangerous storm surge, wind damage and flooding. (Idalia weakened but was still roaring in the Atlantic Ocean over the weekend.)

By the end of August, 11 named storms had formed. Only eight other hurricane seasons in more than 100 years of record-keeping have matched that pace, according to Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert at Colorado State University. They include the busy and memorable seasons of 2005 (the year of Hurricane Katrina), 2020 (with a record 30 named storms) and 2021 (the year of the powerful Ida).

This relatively frenetic end of August doesn’t necessarily mean that we should brace for an onslaught of late-summer and autumn storms, Eric Blake, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, told me. “It’s very common that you’ll get a whole bunch of storms, then it will take a week or two off,” he said.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.1531,['United States'],[]

While the Nicaraguan authorities said they had received no reports of deaths caused by the storm, Honduran officials said a 12-year-old girl was trapped in a mudslide in San Pedro Sula, a city in northern Honduras, The Associated Press reported.

The storm was moving in a westerly direction at about five miles per hour on Thursday afternoon and was expected to pick up speed as it traveled further inland, maintaining a westward or west-northwestward trajectory before veering to the north, forecasters said. It was then expected to swing north-northeast later in the week and head back out into the Caribbean on Thursday night or Friday.

“Through Friday evening, heavy rainfall from Eta will lead to catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding and river flooding across portions of Central America, along with landslides in areas of higher terrain,” the center said.

Here Are 5 Things Our Meteorologist Noticed.,"Over the next few days, the forecast path would nudge north and south, leaving residents fearful of vastly different potential impacts as the storm wobbled. People in Tampa, especially, grew increasingly worried about a worst-case scenario landfall north of Tampa Bay at high tide, which would have delivered a historically destructive storm surge.

Milton quickly became one of the strongest storms ever.

Forecasters did not have Milton’s intensity right on that first go, and they assumed the storm would be a strong Category 2 at landfall. But they started dialing in on the possibility of a major hurricane, a 3 or higher, a few hours later. And that is exactly what happened: From Sunday to Monday, Milton grew from a tropical storm to one of the strongest storms ever in the Gulf of Mexico.

By 8 p.m. on Monday, its wind speeds had increased to 180 miles per hour. Based on wind speed, it joined a handful of other hurricanes that rivaled the strongest Atlantic storm ever recorded: a 1980 hurricane named Allen, which had a peak wind speed of 190 m.p.h. before it made landfall along the United States-Mexico border.

Another way to measure a storm’s strength is by how low the pressure becomes inside it. As hurricane hunter aircraft moved through Milton’s pinhole eye on Monday evening, they recorded a near-record low pressure of 897 millibars, joining only five other Atlantic hurricanes to dip below 900 millibars: Allen, Rita, the Labor Day storm of 1935, Gilbert in 1988 and Wilma.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.8526,"['United States', 'Mexico']","['Gilbert', 'Allen', 'Tampa', 'Milton']"

The first named hurricane of the season, Beryl is the earliest Category 5 Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, and also the first Category 4 hurricane to form in the Atlantic in the month of June — a portent of what experts say is a hurricane season that will be much more intense than usual. It was also abnormal because of where it formed, farther south and east than is typical for storms of this magnitude.

After tearing through the Caribbean and the Yucatán Peninsula, the storm landed in southeast Texas, canceling more than a thousand flights and cutting power for more than two million residents. The storm killed at least 15 people.

Hurricane season usually runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, with most storms developing between mid-August and mid-October.

Climate science and weather science have made impressive advancements in the 15 years since Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in their ability to track these storms and identify how climate change influences their formation and ferocity.

Yet the United States is still woefully unprepared. Our coastlines in many places are overbuilt and lack defenses against storm surge and flooding from heavy rains. And the response in the hours and days after these storms hit is often slow and inadequate.

We can change this. To do so, politicians should turn to the scientists who study these storms and how to protect against the catastrophic damage they can inflict.

Since Katrina, many scientists have focused their careers on assessing the vulnerability of the Gulf Coast and other coastlines to major hurricanes and have spent years assembling government-funded research teams of fellow university scientists, restoration management experts and university-affiliated coastal extension advisers.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.5267,['United States'],['New Orleans']

The season — which officially runs June 1 through Nov. 30, although storms can develop outside that period — is likely to bring 14 to 21 named storms, a category that includes all tropical cyclones with top winds of at least 39 miles per hour. Of those, six to 10 are expected to reach hurricane strength, meaning sustained winds of at least 74 miles per hour. And of that subset, three to six are expected to reach Category 3 or higher, meaning sustained winds of at least 111 miles per hour.

940,2021-05-20,Scientists Predict an ‘Above Normal’ Atlantic Hurricane Season,"Other research suggests that hurricanes may be weakening more slowly after landfall, increasing their destructive abilities, and that storms are slowing down, lingering as they approach and stretching out the damage over longer time periods.

Between the greater water vapor in the atmosphere and the storm slowdowns, Dr. Kossin said, there has been a 41 percent increase in local rainfall associated with storms that move over land. In addition, he said, the tracks of storms are shifting away from the tropics and are heading farther north, with a subsequent expansion of the range of storm risk.

The area of strongest debate concerns whether climate change has a role in the rising number of hurricanes in the Atlantic. Recent research suggests a strong role for human actions, though not all of those actions are directly related to climate change.

The more conservative faction of scientists attributes much of the rise in storms to natural variability and a cycle of ocean warming and cooling known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; NOAA scientists cited the phenomenon as one of the main factors in the rise in last year’s forecast of an active season. Other climate scientists, including Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University, have cast doubt over whether the oscillation exists at all.

Dr. Emanuel of M.I.T. is one of a growing number of scientists who state that the large increase in the number of Atlantic storms is caused by humans, but not mainly because of global warming. The fact that the number of storms dipped in the 1970s and 1980s is in no small part related to pollution, they say — in particular, atmospheric sulfur pollution floating out over the Atlantic from Europe during the postwar boom that cleared up as environmental regulation began cleaning up the skies. “Almost certainly, the hurricane drought of the ’70s and ’80s was an aerosol-related phenomenon,” Dr. Emanuel said.

The finding, he said, “reminds everybody that our influence on climate goes beyond greenhouse gases.”

Easing the problem of billion-dollar extreme weather events would require tackling both pieces of Christopher’s storm damage equation. Reducing carbon emissions and slowing global warming could decrease the likelihood of severe hurricanes and other costly climate disasters like wildfires and droughts.

One option to reduce property damage, experts said, is to strengthen building codes. Florida did so after Hurricane Andrew wreaked havoc in 1992, requiring that new structures be built to better resist high winds. Infrastructure upgrades — like sea walls to block storm surges or pumps to remove rainwater more quickly — could also help against hurricanes, but only so much.

Some experts have proposed a contentious goal: getting people to live elsewhere. The most aggressive effort to persuade Americans to leave hurricane-threatened areas may be a new program that prices federal flood insurance according to climate risk, dramatically increasing costs for people living in vulnerable places.

But relocation is a tough sell. Americans have flocked to Florida’s picturesque coast, despite its risks. “People like living somewhere pretty,” Christopher said.

There are also political challenges. Florida cities and towns rely heavily on property tax revenues, which leaves state and local officials reluctant to reduce density or to encourage relocation.

However, data becomes less available the further back in time one goes, so it is difficult to name a single hurricane that holds the title of “worst.”

The storm that caused the most deaths in recorded history was the “Great Hurricane” of 1780 in the Lesser Antilles. More than 20,000 people died, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The agency ranks Hurricane Mitch, which occurred in 1998 and killed more than 9,000 people in Central America, in second place. Mitch is followed in the ranking by Hurricane Fifi of 1974, which left more than 8,000 in Honduras dead, and a hurricane that struck Galveston, Texas, in 1900 and took around 8,000 lives.

In terms of cost, NOAA lists Katrina as the costliest hurricane to strike the United States since 1851, causing $180 billion in damage. That 2005 hurricane was followed by Harvey ($143.8 billion) and Maria ($103.5 billion) in 2017, Sandy ($80 billion) in 2012 and Ida ($76.5 billion) in 2021.

Scientists have also developed various rating systems to calculate the intensity of a hurricane, such as the Saffir-Simpson Scale, which assigns hurricanes to five categories based on wind speed, and the Hurricane Severity Index, which also takes into account the area potentially affected by the winds. In assessing the strength of a hurricane, other indicators, such as barometric pressure and storm surge, may also be considered.

Theta formed after Tropical Storm Eta spent the day battering Florida, causing heavy rains and flooding in the state’s south and the Keys.

The tumultuous season has raised questions about how much climate change is affecting hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean. Researchers can’t say for sure whether human-caused climate change will mean longer or more active hurricane seasons in the future, but there is broad agreement on one thing: Global warming is changing storms.

Scientists say, for example, that unusually warm Atlantic surface temperatures have helped to increase storm activity this season. The warmer ocean temperatures are “absolutely responsible for the hyperactive season,” said James P. Kossin, a climate scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “It’s very likely that human-caused climate change contributed to that anomalously warm ocean.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,0.9669,[],['Florida']

Here are key facts about how climate change can rapidly intensify tropical storms.

Warming oceans fuel higher winds

More than 90 percent of the excess heat from human-caused global warming over the past 50 years has been absorbed by the oceans. Since 1901, sea surface temperatures have risen an average of 0.14 degrees Fahrenheit per decade, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

That’s crucial, because storms gather strength over the ocean. And, the warmer the water, the more power they pick up.

954,2020-08-03,Hurricane Makes Landfall in North Carolina,"Why have predictions for Isaias seemed so changeable? Adam Sobel, an atmospheric scientist, professor and director of the Initiative on Extreme Weather and Climate at Columbia University, explains.

Isaias has been a tricky storm since it formed. Actually, it was tricky even before it formed, when forecasts benefited from a practice that the National Hurricane Center began three years ago.

The center’s meteorologists have always looked for weather systems in the Atlantic that could become tropical cyclones. But before 2017, they did not start issuing advisories about likely tracks and intensities until the storms actually formed. That left a big hole in the center’s warning system: The public heard days in advance about storms that developed far out to sea, but got much less notice for those forming close to shore.

The center patched that hole by starting to flag “potential tropical cyclones” that could reach land within 48 hours, even though they were still just an idea in the minds of forecasters. Now the public gets the word earlier, though less definitively.

A storm is born: When a low-pressure system that was dithering over the tropical Atlantic last week posed a threat to Puerto Rico and the island of Hispaniola, the center designated it Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine and started issuing forecasts and warnings.

971,2024-10-08,When a Television Meteorologist Breaks Down on Air and Admits Fear,"“They almost feel represented to a degree,” said Mr. Morales, who is 62. “They see this angst and emotion, and this is what Gen Z and Gen Alpha is feeling. They’re feeling anxious about the changing climate. Well, so am I.”

Mr. Morales began his meteorology career in 1984, working for the National Weather Service and then for Univision and Telemundo, before joining NBC6 in Miami as chief meteorologist in 2009. He was among about 100 television meteorologists who were convened for briefings about climate change in 1997 during the Clinton administration, a meeting that Mr. Morales said had inspired him “to try to find a way to communicate the impending threat.” He started weaving more mentions of the impact of climate change into his weather forecasts.

Still, Mr. Morales said he had long prided himself for being a calm voice of reason who was confident he could deliver information that would help people stay out of harm’s way. That changed in recent years, as the intensity and the ferocity of storms grew at rates that were once unimaginable.

“But as the temperature of the planet increases, my confidence in forecasting storm intensity is decreasing,” he wrote in a 2023 essay for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. “Today I am no longer as comfortable in putting everyone at ease in regard to the strength of a storm. I am afraid of rapid intensification cycles happening at the drop of a hat.”

Meteorologists are among the most trusted voices in journalism, yet reporting on extreme weather caused by global warming has put some in the cross hairs of those who don’t accept climate science. Last year, Chris Gloninger left his job as chief meteorologist of KCCI in Des Moines after his broadcasts about climate change resulted in a death threat. Discussions of climate science are especially fraught in Florida, where Gov.

Quite simply, it is impossible to stop land loss and guarantee the safety of people so long as the climate continues to change, sea level continues to rise and warming seas create supercharged storms. It is impossible even if you spend lots of money and do it the right way, as Louisiana has done.

The state is far ahead of the rest of the country in resilience planning, construction and funding. Louisiana has a coastal master plan and a Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to safeguard its coastline. The state has spent tens of billions of dollars and plans to spend tens of billions more building levees, barrier islands, wetlands and sea walls.

977,2022-06-29,What Does the Hurricane Scale Tell Us?,"Hurricanes are categorized by their wind speeds on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The scale was first developed by Herb Saffir, a structural engineer, and Bob Simpson, a meteorologist.

Hurricanes are split into five categories based on the wind speeds they produce:

Category 1: winds between 74 m.p.h. and 95 m.p.h.

Category 2: winds between 96 m.p.h. and 110 m.p.h.

Category 3: winds between 111 m.p.h. and 129 m.p.h.

Category 4: winds between 130 m.p.h. and 156 m.p.h.

Category 5: winds of 157 m.p.h. or greater.

To be considered a “major” hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center, a storm must reach Category 3 or above.

A hurricane’s strength matters because it helps meteorologists give residents in its path an idea of what type of damage is possible.

A Category 2 hurricane, for example, has the potential to cause major roof damage to homes, snap or uproot shallowly rooted trees, and knock out power in an area for days to weeks.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,0,0,1,0.2075,['United States'],[]

Juan Saca, Luma’s president and chief executive, said in a news briefing that crews were out assessing whether power lines had been knocked out — which would require lengthier repairs — or had been brushed by vegetation. A bump from a tree or branch would have automatically shut down the line for safety, Mr. Saca said, but would make it easier to restore power.

982,2023-10-25,Why Hurricane Otis Caught Many By Surprise,"A forecaster uses several tools to create a weather forecast, not just computer models. This is why meteorologists often preach that a computer model isn’t a forecast — forecasters create forecasts, they like to say. They also use satellite data and climatological norms to help form their predictions. They use satellite images to help estimate expected wind speeds, and send hurricane hunter planes to the eye of a storm to collect real-time data.

Using some of those additional tools, forecasters had started predicting a stronger Otis than the models were suggesting — but they were still forecasting it to top out as a tropical storm.

By Monday afternoon, the models started indicating that the storm could become a hurricane, and forecasters believed that with the abundant amount of moisture in the area and warm ocean temperatures, the storm would strengthen gradually.

On Monday evening, with Otis still a tropical storm, satellite images revealed a little feature that could mean that the storm was about to intensify very quickly. But the models still weren’t showing this, so forecasters continued to predict that the storm would be a weaker hurricane.

Global tools like the American forecast model and the European model haven’t always been great about predicting storms’ rapid intensification. Hurricane-specific models were created to help, and this year they have proved useful, including predicting the rapid intensification of Hurricane Idalia well before that storm reached Florida, giving people in the state more time to prepare.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.9861,[],"['Surprise', 'Florida']"

The World Meteorological Organization also said on Wednesday that Dorian, Laura, Eta and Iota would no longer appear on the rotating lists of Atlantic tropical storm names, which repeat every six years. The names were retired, the organization said, because of the death and destruction the storms had caused.

Dorian, a Category 5 hurricane in 2019, was the strongest hurricane to hit the northwestern Bahamas in modern records, according to the organization. It killed more than 60 people and caused catastrophic damage, mainly in Abaco and eastern Grand Bahama Islands. Dexter will replace Dorian on the list of names in 2025.

Hurricane Laura struck Louisiana last August, and was responsible for 47 deaths in the United States and Hispaniola and more than $19 billion in damage, officials said. Leah will now replace Laura on the list of names in 2026.

Just a reminder: It’s November.

And yes, the official Atlantic hurricane season runs through Nov. 30. But that doesn’t mean that Subtropical Storm Nicole, as the system was named on Monday, wouldn’t be a rare event if it strengthened to hurricane status over warm waters near the Bahamas and hit the United States — an outcome the forecast says is likely.

Here are some of the ways that a Hurricane Nicole would be unusual, according to Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University who studies hurricanes and their history:

This year would tie the record set in 2001 for the most Atlantic hurricane formations in November, at three.

If it were to make landfall in Florida at hurricane strength, Nicole would be the second-latest hurricane ever to hit the continental United States, after only Hurricane Kate, which made landfall in 1985 along the Florida Panhandle as a Category 2 hurricane.

It would be the latest recorded landfall ever for a hurricane on the east coast of Florida.

Even if the storm doesn’t make it to hurricane strength, Dr. Klotzbach said that if Nicole sticks to forecasts, it “would still be the strongest tropical storm to make landfall along the Florida east coast this late in the calendar year on record.”

Forecasters issued a hurricane watch on Monday for parts of the east coast of Florida. John Cangialosi, a senior hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center, said in an interview that forecasters expected a small core of hurricane-force winds to develop near the center of Nicole and an expansive tropical storm-force wind field to stretch along the Florida and Georgia coasts.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,0,0,0,0.9827,"['United States', 'Georgia', 'Bahamas']",['Florida']

New data from NASA reveals how warm ocean waters in the Gulf of Mexico fueled Hurricane Ian to become one of the most powerful storms to strike the United States in the past decade.

Sea surface temperatures were especially warm off Florida’s southwest coast, allowing the storm to pick up energy just before crashing into the state north of Fort Myers.

The storm brought fierce winds, unrelenting rains and catastrophic flooding to southwest Florida. As it moved inland, it lost power and was downgraded to a tropical storm, but grew into a hurricane again as it traveled across the warm Atlantic toward South Carolina.

Storms usually weaken as they move over land and lose access to their main source of moisture and energy.

Hurricane Ian was able to, over the course of its path, pull a lot of energy out of the ocean, which could have sustained it for longer than normal, said Christopher Slocum, a physical scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

September is the peak of hurricane season, spurred by temperatures in the Gulf that are warmer than at other times of the year, experts say. The climate phenomenon known as La Niña has also contributed to more favorable conditions for hurricanes in the North Atlantic over the past three years.

However, waters off the coast were also two to three degrees Fahrenheit warmer than usual for this time of year, according to preliminary data from NASA.

And a few degrees can make a huge difference, said Karthik Balaguru, a climate scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, because it provides extra energy for a storm.

Unlike with land or the atmosphere, “it’s very difficult to warm the ocean,” Dr. Balaguru said. A large amount of heat had to have been absorbed by the ocean just to raise temperatures by a small fraction of a degree, he said.

More than 90 percent of the excess heat from human-caused global warming over the past 50 years has been absorbed by the oceans, and a majority of it is stored in the top few hundred meters.

Scientists say that while climate change has not necessarily increased the number of hurricanes, it has made them more powerful, as warmer ocean waters strengthen and sustain those storms. The proportion of the most severe storms — Categories 4 and 5 — has increased since 1980, when satellite imagery began reliably tracking hurricanes.

Warmer Waters, Fiercer Storms Atlantic waters are getting warmer, leading to greater accumulated storm energy, a measure of sustained wind speeds over the course of each hurricane season. 1980s ’90s ’00s ’10s ’20s 2005 1995 2004 2017 1998 2020 1999 1996 2010 2003 2021 2008 2016 1989 2012 2018 2019 2000 2011 1988 More accumulated storm energy 2001 1990 1985 1984 2006 2007 2002 2014 1992 2015 1997 2009 1993 1986 1991 2013 1987 1994 1982 1983 80.0˚F 80.5˚F 81.0˚F 81.5˚F 82.0˚F Average sea surface temperature June – Nov. across the Atlantic hurricane development region 1980s ’90s ’00s ’10s ’20s 2005 1995 2004 2017 1998 2020 1999 1996 2010 2003 2021 2008 2016 1989 2019 2012 2000 2018 2011 1988 More accumulated storm energy 1990 2001 1984 2006 1985 2007 2014 1992 2002 2015 1997 1993 2009 1986 1991 2013 1994 1987 1982 1983 80.0˚F 81.0˚F 82.0˚F Average sea surface temperature June – Nov. across the Atlantic hurricane development region Source: Analysis of NOAA data by Phil Klotzbach, Colorado State University

As the climate warms, more storms are also undergoing rapid intensification, which describes an increase of at least 35 miles per hour in the maximum sustained winds over a 24-hour period. Ian rapidly intensified multiple times, as did a number of the past decade’s most powerful Atlantic storms. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 surged from a Category 1 hurricane to a Category 4 overnight. In 2021, Ida strengthened from a Category 1 to a near-Category 5 in less than 24 hours.

A warmer climate also allows hurricanes to unleash more rain, a consequence of an atmosphere that, with each degree Celsius of warming, can hold about 7 percent more water vapor that then gets released as precipitation. In addition, storm surges are riding on top of elevated sea levels, which can worsen coastal flooding.

Climate change likely made Hurricane Ian wetter, according to a preliminary analysis by two scientists who study extreme weather. They said rainfall totals were at least 10 percent higher than would be expected in a world without warming.

Wetter, more intense hurricanes can have devastating consequences for the communities they strike, said Kristie L. Ebi, a professor in the University of Washington’s Center for Health and the Global Environment. For the most part, the most damage to life and property both during a hurricane and its aftermath comes from the flooding, not the winds, she said.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,commentary,0,0,1,0.9927,"['United States', 'Mexico', 'Cuba']","['Washington', 'Florida', 'Fort Myers']"

991,2022-09-27,‘The Real Deal’: Florida’s Low-Lying Gulf Coast Braces for Hurricane Ian,"TAMPA, Fla. — With so many near-misses over the decades, it had become common to believe Florida’s Tampa Bay region was somehow protected from hurricanes. The last one hit more than a century ago, in 1921, inundating much of Tampa and surrounding towns.

Since then, gleaming high-rises have multiplied in downtown Tampa along the Hillsborough River. Shiny new condos look out on the bay in St. Petersburg. Home values in wealthy enclaves like Shore Acres have crept higher and higher, even though many of the properties are barely a foot above sea level.

As Hurricane Ian winds its way north after swiping western Cuba, the Tampa Bay region and southwest Florida could now face a level of destruction that many who live along the densely populated coast and its white-sand beaches have never experienced. No matter where the storm hits, millions of people will be affected.



Cuba was already suffering. The entire island was without power on Tuesday night after a collapse of the power grid, the country’s Ministry of Mines and Energy said. Officials said the power company was working to restore power, with the hope that some parts of the grid would be working by Wednesday morning.

Ian is forecast to make landfall in southwest Florida as a major hurricane on Wednesday night, with winds up to 130 miles per hour and the biggest storm surge — up to 12 feet — predicted roughly between Sarasota and Naples. That surge and accompanying rainfall are of particular concern for the state’s western coast because the Gulf of Mexico is shallow, leaving excess water with no place to go but onto land.

It also dealt a demoralizing blow to a state still staggering its way back from one of the most powerful storms that it had ever endured.

Delta made landfall in Cameron Parish, less than 20 miles to the east from where Hurricane Laura, with its 150 mile-per-hour winds, devastated communities in late August. And it cut a similar path across a wide swath of the state, hurling debris still piled up from the last storm and toppling utility poles and power lines that crews had just put back up.

“The town’s a mess,” Roberta Palermo said of Lake Arthur, La., a small community in Jefferson Davis Parish, which borders Cameron Parish, where she rode out Delta in the hotel she owns. “There’s debris everywhere and trash that didn’t get picked up from the first storm.”

The storm’s angle to the coast makes it difficult to pinpoint where, exactly, Hilary will make landfall, but forecasters are confident that the storm will continue on its current trajectory, turning north today and moving up the west coast of Baja California.

1000,2020-11-11,Warming May Make Hurricanes Weaken More Slowly After Landfall,"In studying the effects of climate change on hurricanes, scientists have focused on what occurs over water, when storms are forming and strengthening, picking up heat and moisture as they churn over the ocean.

But a new study looks at what happens after hurricanes make landfall and work their way inland. The research suggests that climate change is affecting storms during this phase of their life as well, causing them to weaken more slowly and remain destructive for longer.

The findings could have implications for how emergency-management agencies prepare for storms post-landfall.

In the study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, Lin Li and Pinaki Chakraborty of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University in Japan analyzed data from North Atlantic hurricanes that made landfall from 1967 to 2018, looking at the decay in intensity, or wind speed, of the storms in the first day after hitting land.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.8834,['Japan'],[]

Over the last decade, the number of weather-related power outages has almost doubled, according to Climate Central. Most major power outages between 2000 and 2023 were caused by extreme weather, and 14 percent of those were caused by tropical cyclones and hurricanes.

Some of the counties with the highest risk for more frequent power outages — like Broward County, Fla., Wilkinson County, Miss., and Hyde County, N.C. — also have the highest levels of social vulnerability, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those counties have demographic and social-economic factors, like poverty and lack of transportation access, that can adversely affect communities that face natural disasters.

Hurricane Ian, one of the most powerful storms to menace the United States in decades, made landfall in southeast Florida on Sept. 28 as a Category 4 storm. Along its path it washed away roads, bridges, cars, boats and homes, and knocked out power for millions of people. Officials said more than 80 people died. The New York Times writes:

The scale of the wreckage was staggering, even to Florida residents who had survived and rebuilt after other powerful hurricanes. The storm pulverized roads, toppled trees, gutted downtown storefronts and set cars afloat, leaving a soggy scar of ruined homes and businesses from the coastal cities of Naples and Fort Myers to inland communities around Orlando.

People across southwestern Florida have begun to take stock of the devastation left behind by Hurricane Ian. The damage is so extensive that, according to Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, it may take years to rebuild.

In this lesson plan, we share ideas for how teachers and students can explore both the storm’s devastating effects and the science behind this natural disaster.

2. What is a hurricane? And are hurricanes getting stronger?

A hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone — a circular storm that forms over warm waters, with very low air pressure at the center and sustained winds greater than 74 miles per hour. Hurricanes form in the North Atlantic, the northeastern Pacific, the Caribbean Sea or the Gulf of Mexico (as opposed to typhoons, which develop in the northwestern Pacific and usually affect Asia). Hurricane Ian had maximum sustained winds of around 155 miles per hour, making it a Category 4 storm (just shy of Category 5, which requires winds in excess of 157 m.p.h.).",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,1,0,2,-0.5686,"['United States', 'Mexico']","['Fort Myers', 'Asia', 'Naples', 'Orlando', 'Along', 'Florida']"

First, Hurricane Eta, then just two weeks later, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane of the season, Iota. The Indigenous Miskito village of Haulover suffered a direct hit. When the skies cleared, the coastline had been transformed. Where once there was a verdant coconut grove, the ocean now cut through the center of town, connecting to a lagoon. Nicaragua has seen storms before, but never like this. As climate change intensifies, hurricanes are becoming more destructive, and these coastal communities are bearing the brunt. Now people here are facing a new dilemma. Should they rebuild in the only area they’ve ever known, or should they seek refuge inland, away from the sea? One person advising displaced residents is Marcos Williamson, an environmental scientist at the Regional Autonomous University in Puerto Cabezas. He’s sending a team of researchers to Haulover to assess storm damage and to determine if it’s even a viable place for people to live anymore. 2020 tied for the hottest year on record for the planet. And it was the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic. When the team sets out, it finds Nicaragua’s vast old mangrove forests battered and broken … … along with wildlife that appear to be disoriented or hurt. Donald Williams, a marine biologist, says that local fish and wildlife need mangroves to survive. If these mangroves don’t recover, then the fish, Haulover’s key source of food and livelihood, may not either. Now all the rotting material and saltwater have upset the lagoon’s ecological balance, and they’re endangering the freshwater fish. Gone, too, are the coconut trees and a dietary staple. Lorenzo Castro is a community leader, whose family has lived in the region for generations. Castro and other leaders have identified a tract of land suitable for resettlement, located a few miles inland along the canal. And having surveyed the damage, researchers agree that moving inland is the safe course of action. But moving inland, while safer from hurricanes, comes with a price. It would mean abandoning a cultural way of life by the sea and taking up farming. That’s a change many aren’t ready to make, not yet. While scientists and community leaders can advise, in the end, it’s up to the residents to decide where, or if, they want to go. For now, most are surviving with donated food and fishing supplies, hoping for government assistance, and building temporary shacks where their houses once stood. A number of families, about 60 of the 300 or so, have already decided to move to the safer inland location. In the meantime, everyone is salvaging what they can of their former lives. “One, two, three.”",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,1,1,-0.8272,['Nicaragua'],['Castro']
1008,2023-05-09,Hurricanes of Data: The Tiny Craft Mapping Superstorms at Sea,"The Tiny Craft Mapping Superstorms at Sea Shortly after dawn on Sept. 30, 2021, Richard Jenkins watched a Category 4 hurricane overrun his life’s work. The North Atlantic storm was a behemoth — 50,000 feet tall and 260 miles wide. Wind circled the eye wall at 143 miles per hour; waves the size of nine-story apartment buildings tumbled through a confused sea. Puerto Rico lay 500 miles to the southwest; Bermuda was 800 miles straight ahead. Eighty miles northwest, the 23-foot boat that Jenkins had designed and built over the last decade struggled to stay upright. Saildrone Explorer SD 1045 was a research boat. Its blaze-orange torpedo-shaped hull had a deep keel and a rigid carbon-fiber sail engineered to withstand hurricane-force wind and waves. Probes, antennae and a suite of meteorological and oceanographic instruments jutted from the deck and the hull, all powered by wind, water and sun and capable of measuring the extraordinary forces of the open ocean. As the name suggests, SD 1045 was unmanned, allowing the boat to operate in some of the most remote and inhospitable corners of the planet for up to 12 months at a time without being serviced.

Throughout history, most sea captains have tried to steer their vessels out of extreme weather, but the whole purpose of SD 1045 was to steer into it. “The goal was not just to get into the hurricane but to get to the strongest quarter,” Jenkins said as we watched a video of the storm, shot from SD 1045’s masthead camera. “The big engineering challenge was to create enough sailing power to get in front of the storm, but not so much power that the storm destroys the boat.”

Jenkins and a crew of pilots in Saildrone’s cavernous mission-control room, set in a 1930s Navy hangar on the shores of San Francisco Bay, had been using a satellite link for months to maneuver SD 1045 and four sister ships into North Atlantic hurricanes. The boats were frequently caught in doldrums and set back by powerful ocean currents skirting the East Coast of the United States. That August, a sister ship, SD 1031, successfully entered Tropical Storm Henri, but only in its early stages. With a few weeks left in the 2021 hurricane season, SD 1045 appeared to be the last opportunity to get a Saildrone inside a major hurricane, where it would try to harvest data that could help scientists develop a more sophisticated understanding of why such storms’ intensity has spiked over the last half-century.

As climate change has accelerated, warmer atmospheric and ocean temperatures have increased the likelihood of a hurricane developing into a Category 3 storm or higher by 8 percent per decade. While the total number of tropical cyclones — including “typhoons” and “cyclones” — around the world has dropped over the last century, in the North Atlantic more Category 4 and 5 hurricanes made landfall in the United States from 2017 to 2021 than from 1963 to 2016. Globally, the number of major hurricanes, including a new breed of ultraintense Category 5 storms with winds of at least 190 m.p.h., could increase by 20 percent over the next 60 to 80 years. Once-established storm tracks are simultaneously changing as hurricanes last longer and penetrate deeper over land. According to a 2021 study by Yale University researchers, warmer waters will soon draw extreme storms north as well, threatening to inundate densely populated cities like Washington, D.C.; New York; Providence, R.I.; and Boston.

Storm surges now ride on an elevated sea level, flooding coastlines with walls of water more than 25 feet high (Hurricane Katrina, 2005). Because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, storms can now dump more than 60 inches of rain on a single region (Hurricane Harvey, 2017). Hurricanes over the United States have also slowed more than 15 percent since 1947, contributing to a 25 percent increase in local rainfall. One example of how the compounding forces of climate change, like sea-level rise, and more intense storms are overwhelming coastlines, according to Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: If Superstorm Sandy had occurred in 1912 instead of 2012, it may not have flooded Lower Manhattan.

Humanity has not flinched in the face of this gathering threat, but has rather charged blindly into it, migrating to coastlines at a record pace, enacting deficient building codes and resiliency plans, pumping ever more carbon into the atmosphere and even slowing mitigation efforts by questioning the veracity of climate change.

Humans didn’t always settle in a manner so disconnected from the planet: Overlay storm tracks from the last two centuries on a map of the world, and you’ll notice how, throughout history, most major cities were built outside their reach. As that reach and intensity grows farther and faster than any time in the last three million years, another reality becomes painfully evident: Civilization can’t relocate as it once could, leaving millions of people smack in the cross hairs of severe storms with little to no resiliency, warning or even plan.

At risk on the U.S. mainland are 60 million coastal residents from Texas to Maine. Along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts, you will find a dozen major seaside cities, thousands of coastal towns, half of the nation’s oil-refining business and major infrastructure like highways, airports, freight-rail lines and much of the shipping industry, which is already backed up globally with supply-chain issues as it transports, by tonnage, 90 percent of all trade across the ocean. A recent N.P.R. analysis of National Hurricane Center data revealed that 720,000 residents of Miami, Washington and New York are in danger of being flooded by rising sea levels and storm surge. In the last four decades alone, hurricanes cost the United States more than $1.1 trillion and nearly 7,000 lives. By the end of the century, they could set the United States back over $100 billion annually.

Jenkins knows firsthand the ferocity of maritime storms. His windswept hair and tanned crow’s feet are more befitting a sea captain than a San Francisco tech entrepreneur. He grew up building boats in Southampton, England, then sailed yachts around Europe and the Mediterranean as a delivery captain. He prefers two-dimensional landscapes to the hustle of the city. After studying mechanical engineering at Imperial College London, he spent a decade car-camping in salt flats and dry lake beds around the world, trying to best the obscure (yet highly competitive) land-speed record for a wind-powered vehicle. When he finally broke it — and almost himself, while steering the land yacht at 126 m.p.h. across the Mojave Desert — he pivoted his design to ocean sailing and a new mission: building the first unmanned boat to sail around the world.

Jenkins found an unlikely partner in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the sprawling parent organization of all U.S. weather agencies. Hurricane research, modeling and forecasting requires many terabytes of data for every square mile the storm passes through, including vitally important sea-level data from inside a storm. This has, for obvious reasons, been nearly impossible to obtain. Several generations of automated buoys, subsurface sea gliders and dropsondes — launched from turboprop Hurricane Hunter aircraft in the middle of a storm — have been employed to measure the “planetary boundary” between sea and sky, where a hurricane gets its power. But most of the devices offer only a snapshot of conditions. Jenkins’s contribution to the endeavor is a Swiss Army knife of oceanic observation that can maneuver into a storm and measure air, surface and subsea data in real time, without the cost of fuel, provisions or human lives.

Jenkins walked me around the Saildrone factory floor that morning, speaking quickly, often without pausing for minutes or even an hour at a time. He plays the role of engineer, chief executive, inventor, climatologist, oceanographer, naval architect and captain on any given day — a corporeal C.P.U. of the company. He touched on everything from hydrodynamics to hurricane structure to electrical engineering and bathymetry — ocean mapping — as we wandered among four neat rows of gleaming Saildrone hulls. Gunmetal-gray steel racks and wheeled carts held appendages and instruments, all fabricated in-house and “ruggedized” by Saildrone and NOAA. The company is based in Alameda Point, a hub of the techno-utopianism that has swept through the Bay Area. (Jenkins occasionally commutes by motorboat from his home in Alameda.) Just down the block, researchers are developing a safer nuclear reactor. A few doors away is the former factory of Makani, a project founded by a consortium of kite-surfing inventors who added wind turbines to giant kites to create energy, à la Ben Franklin.

A half-dozen workers meandered between boats as Jenkins took me to the boardroom to watch the video of SD 1045. Wind gusts hit 120 m.p.h. in what would become one of the longest-lasting North Atlantic hurricanes on record. Hurricane Sam had recently reorganized and ratcheted up from Category 3 to the upper range of Category 4. Sea spray and rain turned the air into a foggy emulsion; breaking waves slammed the boat with the force of a tractor-trailer. Two hours later, on the edge of the eye wall, the scene on Jenkins’s screen became otherworldly, with 143-m.p.h. gusts and 89-foot waves.

Few vessels could withstand the vectors moving through the North Atlantic that day. (In 2015, Hurricane Joaquin’s monster waves severed the top two decks of the steel freighter El Faro’s superstructure, sending the 790-foot ship to the bottom of the ocean along with all 33 crew members.) But SD 1045 persevered, its gauges recording multiple knockdowns, 360-degree capsizes and a 30-m.p.h. sleigh ride down the back of a giant wave.

As the pilot managed to maneuver the ship closer to the storm’s eye — a Dantesque arena of minitornadoes, falling sheets of ice, hot tower thunderheads and torrential wind and rain bands — Jenkins and a dozen NOAA scientists across the country turned to a never-before-seen stream of data broadcast from the heart of the hurricane: air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, water temperature, salinity, sea-surface temperature and wave height. Watching it was like watching transmissions from a Mars rover — columns of numbers and decimal points broadcast from an alien world gradually sketching a detailed picture of the cyclone. If this level of data could consistently be harvested from hurricanes at sea, Jenkins and his colleagues realized, it could very well change our understanding of one of the most damaging, costly and deadly forms of natural disaster in the world.

The ocean is a terrestrial outer space — Earth’s last true wilderness, which remains surprisingly unexplored by humankind.

It stretches for 139 million square miles and is on average more than 10,000 feet deep. Anyone who has spent time on or near it knows that watching the sea is like watching a fire: It is always transforming, moving, reordering as it mixes and flows. It is no more a “thing” than deep space is a thing — more conceptual than it is representational. It is physis, as the ancient Greeks wrote, translated as “nature,” “creation” or “growth.”

The quest to study the sea and its storms predates Aristotle, who hypothesized that Earth’s oceans were frigid at the poles and too hot to inhabit near the Equator. Half a century before Christopher Columbus’s first voyage across the Atlantic, Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal dispatched a series of expeditions along the coast of Africa in what was in part one of the first Western maritime data-harvesting missions in history. (Keep in mind that sea monsters were considered a navigational hazard by many at the time.) His captains returned with observations detailing sea temperature, zoological discoveries and curious and persistent winds and currents, the volta do mar, that allowed them to sail with the breeze behind them in a giant circle from Portugal down to the Canary Islands, up to the Azores and home. Over the next 400 years, these and other “trade winds” and the currents they pushed would carry human civilization around the world, along with a breed of superstorm unknown to Westerners.

The seed of Hurricane Sam took shape over the African Sahel 11 days before SD 1045 encountered it. It’s here that the hot, dry Sahara meets cooler savannas to the south, creating an easterly wind called the African Easterly Jet. Instability in the jet frequently forms low-pressure areas that move west toward the Atlantic. With enough moisture, convection and atmospheric turmoil, these “tropical waves” can form a cluster of powerful thunderstorms. Around 60 tropical waves pass through the region every year, ultimately forming most major Atlantic hurricanes. One such wave moved off the African coast on Sept. 19, 2021. Three days later, southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands, it was hooked, jarred, twisted or, as some cultures believe, touched by the hand of a god, initiating enough convective banding features and low-level circulation to be upgraded to a tropical depression. The next day, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and officially given the name Sam. Warm water and low vertical wind shear helped induce a period of rapid intensification, and Sam was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane with wind speeds of 75 m.p.h. A second rapid intensification event saw wind speeds jump by 50 m.p.h. in a 24-hour period. Sam strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane, with peak winds reaching 155 m.p.h., just below the threshold of a Category 5 storm. Sam moved northwest and weakened for several days because of southwesterly wind shear. It strengthened again over warmer water 500 miles northeast of Puerto Rico — where it met SD 1045. Sam passed within 200 miles of Bermuda as its outer circulation expanded, brushing the island with tropical-storm-force winds. It lost power as it moved northeast over colder water. The system’s cloud pattern eventually became asymmetric, and Sam was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone. More than a week after it formed, Hurricane Sam became one of the longest-lasting Atlantic hurricanes on record.

Only satellite images can give a true sense of the symmetry and stunning size of a mature tropical cyclone: a vortex of wind and moisture up to a thousand miles in diameter that bends with the curvature of the planet. A single storm can blot out the coastline between Maine and Florida and generate more than 200 times the energy that the world’s power plants create in a single day. (Or the power of 240 10-megaton nuclear bombs detonated every 20 minutes; take your pick.) Over millions of years, these storms have carved coastlines and ocean basins. They have wiped out entire ecosystems and redistributed others across oceans. They can even transport their own avian community of shearwaters, frigatebirds, petrels and songbirds that may fly above or become trapped in the relatively calm eye of the storm for many miles, only to be unceremoniously dumped on the shores of a distant place.

The Gulf Coast, with its warm, shallow water and troublesome Loop Current, has seen more than three dozen major hurricanes since 1851. But it is Florida that holds the distinction of being the most hurricane-prone state in the country. More than 100 tropical cyclones have made landfall there in the same time span, making locals who experienced some of those storms wonder if the current influx of newcomers to the Sunshine State will pack up and leave after their first hurricane season.

Greg Foltz of NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (A.O.M.L.) lives on relatively high ground among the neat, terra-cotta-capped bungalows of Coral Gables. He met me at a concrete picnic pavilion on Miami’s Virginia Key, a hundred yards from the Bauhausian A.O.M.L. campus. Foltz is a willowy 46 years old, soft-spoken, with a salty nerdiness that perhaps only an oceanographer can achieve. He grew up with the thrum of nor’easters, squalls and the occasional hurricane outside Boston before joining NOAA in 2010. He is now lead principal investigator of the Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) Northeast Extension and its array of red-and-white research buoys, outfitted for oceanographic observation and hurricane forecasting.

One of Foltz’s duties is finding new tech to expand and improve the observation system. After colleagues at his former lab, NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (P.M.E.L.) in Seattle, told him about Saildrones, he set up a meeting to discuss building a drone that could record the inner workings of a hurricane. Jenkins had been collaborating with NOAA for four years, fine-tuning instruments and redesigning the hull and sail plan. Foltz wrote a grant and secured SD 1045 and four other drones for the 2021 hurricane season. The morning of Sept. 30, he watched from a makeshift home office as SD 1045 sailed into Hurricane Sam.

Amid a flurry of congratulatory text messages that morning, Foltz homed in on an anomaly in the drone’s data stream. Sam had undergone rapid intensification, during which a storm’s maximum winds increase 35 m.p.h. or more in 24 hours. The phenomenon, which is difficult to forecast and often occurs just before landfall, has become a priority for U.S. weather agencies, as it often leaves coastal residents expecting a mild storm only to be walloped by a Category 3 or 4 hurricane. Rapid intensification used to spin up once a century, but studies show that in the future, it could occur more frequently — especially in waters bordering the East Coast. In 2020 alone, 10 Atlantic hurricanes underwent rapid intensification. The next year, Hurricane Ida’s winds jumped to 150 m.p.h. from 85 just before making landfall in New Orleans and Alabama, ominously on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.

The readings Foltz noticed indicated that surface temperatures beneath Sam were higher than normal. Typically, evaporation and ocean mixing beneath a hurricane cools surface water near the eye. But SD 1045 indicated that the surface was not cooling. It was warming up, creating a storm with no bridle.

The readings were so off that Foltz assumed a gauge had broken. He checked SD 1045’s wind-speed figures against a nearby research buoy and saw similar numbers. He also noticed low salinity in the water and confirmed those readings with satellite data. Weeks later, after poring over the data, Foltz and his colleagues concluded that a pool of fresh water — which is less dense than salt water and floats on top of it — had likely blocked upwelling currents from cooling the surface.

The discovery provided further evidence in an area that had confounded meteorologists for decades. Two months after Hurricane Sam veered northeast and sputtered out southeast of Greenland, NOAA sent out a news release titled “Measuring Salt in the Ocean May Be Key to Predicting Hurricane Intensity.” The release outlined how the outflow of the Amazon, Orinoco and Mississippi Rivers could potentially obstruct upwelling and ocean mixing beneath storms. Further study the next spring illustrated how increased rainfall in today’s supersaturated storms could also dump enough freshwater to reduce upwelling and ocean cooling, making intensification more likely.

Foltz took a summary of his findings to the National Hurricane Center. “Now they’re starting to appreciate that salinity can affect hurricane intensity,” he says.

A month after SD 1045 safely sailed back to port, a disturbance in the Pacific Ocean developed into a tropical depression. The storm was named Rai, and two days later it became a Category 1 typhoon. As the storm bore down on the volcanic ridgelines and montane rainforests hemming the Philippines, rapid intensification took it from the equivalent of a Category 1 Atlantic hurricane to a supertyphoon, equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 160 m.p.h.

In 48 hours, Rai decimated thousands of villages, killed more than 400 people, drove seven million from their homes and inflicted hundreds of millions of dollars in damage — including postponing a mass coronavirus vaccination effort. Rai was not the first storm to hit the Philippines in 2021. Fourteen other gales overran the islands earlier that year, sometimes just weeks apart. And four months later, Tropical Storm Megi killed more than 150, wiped out several villages with landslides and displaced more than a million people.

With their billions in damages and clever National Hurricane Center tweets — “Kate Still a Poorly Organized Depression” — Atlantic hurricanes represent just 16 percent of all annual tropical cyclones. Hurricane basins in the Pacific that border Australia, Indonesia, Fiji, Japan and the Philippines get 60 percent of the storms, while 24 percent roam the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific. Called typhoons when they originate in the Northwest Pacific and cyclones in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean, the storms are identical in all but name to hurricanes. They are also growing stronger as the ocean warms beneath them.

It should be well known by now that developing nations least responsible for creating the climate crises are suffering disproportionally from its geophysical fallout.

Nowhere is this incongruity more evident than in weather- and climate-related natural disasters — which increased fivefold globally from 1970 to 2019, with 91 percent of associated deaths occurring in the developing world. The proportion of Category 4 and 5 typhoons making landfall in East and Southeast Asia appears to have increased, with storms lasting longer, penetrating farther inland and causing vastly more damage. A 2016 study found that the average intensity of all typhoons in the region had grown by 12 to 15 percent from 1977 to 2014. Typhoon Koppu in 2015 dumped 35 inches of rain on the Philippines, and Cyclone Freddy in February became the longest, most powerful tropical cyclone in any ocean basin in history after destroying large swaths of Madagascar and Mozambique. There is no longer respite from typhoon season in the western North Pacific, either. Storm season now essentially lasts all year.

Damage and loss of life on the low-lying, densely populated coastlines of Asia and Africa — typically with little to no resiliency or early-warning systems — is beyond compare. Some of the most infamous storms in history made landfall there: the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which pushed a 33-foot-tall storm surge across the Ganges Delta in what is now Bangladesh, with an estimated death toll as high as 500,000; Typhoon Nina in 1975 and a resulting dam failure, which took more than 150,000 lives in China’s Henan Province; and Myanmar’s Cyclone Nargis in 2008, with more than 100,000 dead or missing after a 13-foot storm surge swept across the Irrawaddy Delta.

Lack of data and accurate forecasting is largely to blame for the high casualty rate. Much of the region still uses weather balloons to gauge atmospheric conditions, and a lack of reliable electricity makes automated weather stations and data transmission difficult. About one-third of the world’s population has no access to extreme-weather early-warning systems — including a stunning 60 percent of people in Africa. A 2019 report by the Global Commission on Adaptation addressed the shortfall, outlining how an $800 million investment in forecasting could avoid up to $16 billion in weather-related damage. The United Nations took up the challenge in 2021 at its climate conference, COP26, in Glasgow. The next year it promised technology within five years that will deliver storm warnings to every region on the planet.

One presentation at COP26 addressed the scarcity of ocean-data collection vital to understanding tropical cyclones and climate change in general — not just in the developing world but everywhere. More than 80 percent of the ocean has yet to be mapped in high definition, and hardly any of it is being empirically monitored and measured regularly. Oceanographers often point out that appropriations for NASA’s deep-space exploration outpaces ocean exploration by more than 150 to 1 — to the point that scientists know more about the surface of Mars than they do about our own seas, which play an outsize role in the climate crisis and are far more important to the survival of our species. Forecasters and climate modelers, who rely heavily on ocean data, may have to use estimated numbers in their calculations, opening the door to potential large-scale errors in the planet’s carbon budget and all-important global-warming estimates.

The presenter, the NOAA oceanographer Adrienne Sutton, argued that this “black hole of data” is hampering our understanding of how the ocean is changing and how those changes affect food webs, carbon sequestration, weather and storms. To date, the world’s oceans have taken in around 90 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases and more than 30 percent of carbon dioxide emitted by human activity. This role as buffer, which has most likely saved humanity from certain and swift extinction, has come with consequences, including sea-level rise, ocean acidification, coral die-offs, shifting global circulation currents and a rise in intense tropical cyclones.

The focus of Sutton’s presentation was the Southern Ocean, which encircles Antarctica and is one of the least-studied bodies of water on Earth. It has historically absorbed about 40 percent of the human-produced CO2 in the ocean. In early 2019, Saildrone launched SD 1020, outfitted with a CO2 sensor from Sutton’s team, and made what is believed to be the first unmanned circumnavigation of Antarctica. The drone completed the 13,670-mile journey in 196 days, enduring 50-foot waves, 80-m.p.h. winds, freezing temperatures and even a collision with an iceberg. Over the following few months, more than 4,700 CO2 measurements confirmed what scientists suspected — parts of the Southern Ocean were not absorbing CO2 year-round. They were outgassing it in the winter.

“During the winter, the Southern Ocean was a carbon source — which threw the entire carbon budget into disarray,” Richard Jenkins says. “Where is that 30 percent of carbon emissions going? No one has an answer for that, which is a phenomenally poor understanding of our planetary systems. Our goal is to get enough data to get the models to reduce the margin of error so that everyone can agree on our trajectory.”

As another hurricane season approaches, much of the U.S. coast remains unprepared. Flood insurance for millions of Americans living near the ocean is still optional. Some federal disaster loans to rebuild after a storm are contingent on credit; consumer-protection laws do not rein in corrupt contractors who flock to disaster areas; and many state governments lack the funds and staffing necessary to manage recovery.

Eighteen years after Hurricane Katrina rolled over the clapboard shacks and corner stores of New Orleans’s Lower Ninth Ward, the population is still around 30 percent of what it was in 2000 — with only a handful of businesses to serve residents. Communities in the nine states that experienced Hurricane Ida’s torrential wind and rain in 2021 are still rebuilding, and parts of Long Island, Staten Island and New Jersey are still recovering from Superstorm Sandy 11 years later — all while New York City repeatedly delayed and rewrote its plans to fortify and protect Lower Manhattan from another direct hit.

On the streets of Fort Myers, Fla., where Hurricane Ian, a Category 4 storm, killed more than 150 people and caused an estimated $112.9 billion in damages in September, many residents remain displaced, and even more are still waiting on insurance checks. Full recovery could take up to a decade, disaster experts say, assuming another storm does not hit before then.

What worries tropical-cyclone modelers like Hiro Murakami, a project scientist at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, N.J., are regions with little to no experience with major storms being drawn into tropical-cyclone territory. Warming water off the coast of Europe over the last 20 years has opened the door to storms like ex-Hurricane Ophelia in 2017, which grazed Ireland with gusts up to 119 m.p.h. The next year, Hurricane Helene followed a rare path, traveling north from Africa, instead of west, eventually affecting the United Kingdom. Other regions being drawn into cyclone territory include India’s west coast, eastern Japan, Hawaii and the sprawling agrarian-industrial coastline that wraps around northeastern China.

Storms are even hitting the Middle East with more power, Murakami says, like Cyclone Shaheen in 2021. The storm took a remarkable path from the Bay of Bengal across India and the Arabian Sea and made landfall in Oman as a severe cyclone, the first one there in recorded history. “They have no experience with it,” Murakami says. “No dikes. No defenses.”

Another concern is the overall rise of extreme weather. Just look at 2022: Extreme rainstorms flooded the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro; low rainfall in Iraq resulted in a huge dust storm that shut down most of the country; heat waves in India and Pakistan brought temperatures topping 120 degrees Fahrenheit in some places, followed by exceptionally rainy monsoon seasons; and freak tornadoes tore through New Orleans. The opening months of 2023 had a parade of atmospheric rivers — made wetter and more intense by climate change — dump more than 30 trillion gallons of water on California.

Gore-Tex-clad meteorologists clinging to seaside piers have popularized a vibrant vocabulary for our new meteorological reality: bombogenesis, polar vortex, vapor storm, wave overtopping, sting jets, megadroughts. It is a dangerous game relating all weather disasters to climate change, but when one considers the complex and interrelated nature of climate and weather systems on Earth, there’s no denying that they must be linked to some degree. Adding an estimated 0.7 watts of heat to every square meter of land and water on the planet is influencing pretty much everything in the ocean and sky, even the poofy thunderheads that glide over your backyard on a summer afternoon.

Such are the perils of disturbing the equilibrium that Earth has maintained for millions of years, Murakami says. With average atmospheric CO2 content topping 417 parts per million for the first time in more than four million years, he points out another often overlooked and underreported fact: If we stopped burning fossil fuels today, additional warming would begin to flatten within a few years, as would the escalation of tropical-cyclone intensity.

“If we can successfully constrain emissions in the middle of the 21st century, and CO2 emissions decrease afterward, hurricane activity will also go back to present-day,” he says. “Cyclone activity largely follows the path of CO2 levels.”

Colorado State University released its annual hurricane outlook in April, anticipating 13 named storms, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes in 2023. Foltz and Saildrone were already preparing a new fleet of drones. The plan was to match them with aerial drones launched from Hurricane Hunter aircraft and subsea gliders so researchers could analyze the architecture of a storm from hundreds of feet beneath the ocean’s surface to thousands of feet above it.

Foltz will watch their progress from his office in NOAA’s A.O.M.L. lab. It will most likely take each drone a month to navigate into position and then a few weeks to coordinate with the gliders and aerial drones. Then Foltz, Jenkins and a crew of NOAA scientists across the nation will wait patiently — watching the skies, monitoring the Atlantic’s ever-warming temperature and waiting for a line of thunderheads to be hooked and whirled into a perfect storm.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,commentary,4,1,1,-0.8964,"['Cabo Verde', 'Japan', 'Ireland', 'Philippines', 'Australia', 'United States', 'India', 'Jersey', 'Indonesia', 'Puerto Rico', 'Portugal', 'Madagascar', 'Myanmar', 'Pakistan', 'Antarctica', 'Bangladesh', 'Greenland', 'Bermuda', 'Iraq', 'Fiji', 'United Kingdom', 'Mozambique', 'China', 'Oman']","['Washington', 'Boston', 'Fort Myers', 'Alameda', 'Miami', 'London', 'Coral Gables', 'Sutton', 'Providence', 'Staten Island', 'Murakami', 'Southampton', 'New Orleans', 'Rio de Janeiro', 'Much', 'Florida', 'Bay', 'New York', 'Seattle', 'Asia', 'Princeton', 'Bhola', 'Along', 'San Francisco', 'Sandy', 'Long Island', 'Texas', 'Glasgow']"
1009,2022-10-19,Hurricane Ian Is Blamed for Deadly Bacterial Infections in Florida,"When Hurricane Ian made landfall in southwestern Florida late last month, officials urged residents to avoid wading in storm waters, which they warned could be contaminated with dangerous chemicals and bacteria.

But avoiding the water proved to be a challenge, as streets were inundated and cars engulfed, and the floodwater made it into homes and countless other structures in the hurricane’s path.

In the storm’s aftermath, there has been a rise in reported cases of Vibrio vulnificus, a rare and potentially deadly bacterial infection that can cause tissue around open wounds to die. There are 28 cases of it in Florida, state data shows. At least seven people have died, according to a spokesman for the state Health Department.

These infections, while rare, can occur when open wounds come into contact with contaminated water, the state’s Health Department said.

1010,2020-11-14,"Iota, Now a Hurricane, Is Season’s 30th Named Storm","Tropical Storm Iota strengthened into a hurricane early Sunday as it continued to carve a path through the Caribbean Sea, days after becoming the 30th named storm in the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season.

The storm, which was moving west-northwest at nine miles per hour as of 10 a.m. Sunday, was about 335 miles east of Cabo Gracias a Dios, on the Nicaragua-Honduras border, with maximum sustained winds around 90 m.p.h. It was expected to strengthen steadily and gain speed over the next couple of days as it approached Central America, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Iota could become a major hurricane — Category 3 or above — as it approaches Central America, Dennis Feltgen, a spokesman and meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center in Miami, said Friday night. It is expected to reach the coasts of Honduras and Nicaragua on Monday. Rainfall could total 16 to 30 inches in some areas.

1011,2022-05-11,"Air Pollution Can Mean More, or Fewer, Hurricanes. It Depends Where You Live.","The new study looked at the numbers, not the strength, of these kinds of storms. Its author, Hiroyuki Murakami, said it shows that reducing or increasing anthropogenic aerosols “is the most important component” affecting frequency.

James P. Kossin, a scientist with The Climate Service, which analyzes climate risks for companies, and an author of the 2020 study, said that Dr. Murakami’s research was consistent with other studies showing that “warming by regional pollution reduction has a much more profound effect on hurricane activity” than warming of the ocean from increasing greenhouse gases. The new study “attempts to provide a more global context in which the regional climate changes are occurring,” he said.

The study was published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.

Dr. Murakami, a physical scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, N.J., used computer simulations to do something that would be a practical impossibility in the real world: isolate the effects of pollutants like sulfur dioxide. These form aerosols, small particles that, as a component of air pollution, have been shown to be harmful to human health. They also can block some sunlight from reaching Earth’s surface.

In recent decades aerosol pollution has declined, perhaps by as much as 50 percent, in North America and Europe as a result of laws and regulations that reduce emissions from sources like vehicles and power plants.

1012,2023-11-01,Acapulco Saw the Future of Hurricanes: More Sudden and Furious,"Although, conventionally, hurricanes are measured by their peak intensity, how quickly they reach that intensity and how rapidly they approach land matters enormously. Over the last century, the world has made remarkable if unequal progress in reducing human mortality from storms, even as tallies of property damage have appeared to grow larger. Much of that progress is thanks to better forecasting and early warning systems — having a few days, rather than a few hours, to prepare makes even the most brutal storms much easier to endure and survive. A tropical storm isn’t an insignificant threat, and what became Otis surely would’ve damaged Acapulco even if it hadn’t ever intensified. But a Category 5 is a threat of a different order, requiring an entirely different scale of preparatory response. You simply can’t evacuate a city of one million in just a few hours — at least, it’s never been managed before.

But it wasn’t just the speed of intensification that has marked Otis as different; after all, hurricanes are now routinely slowing and growing much stronger as they approach land, powered by ever warmer ocean waters. It was the surprise of the storm’s transformation, with few of the conventional forecasting models predicting any significant intensification at all.

How could this happen? A week later, it remains a meteorological mystery. Climate scientists have been noting for years the pattern of rapid intensification; a landmark 2017 paper was called “Will global warming make hurricane forecasting more difficult?” and new research on the subject, focused on North Atlantic hurricanes, was published just two weeks ago. But though Otis fits the general pattern, nothing about the conditions that gave rise to it seemed to raise the proper alarms in the conventional models. Local ocean temperatures were high, to be sure, but not crazily so. Low wind shear contributed, too, allowing the storm to gain strength somewhat undisturbed — but there, too, the metrics were not that unusual. The storm was relatively compact, which may have meant micro conditions were more important than more large-scale factors, which meteorologists tend to emphasize.

“Otis was the worst nightmare for forecasters,” says Kerry Emanuel, the author of that 2017 paper, whose own model, which isn’t included in the major ensemble projections, did show some chance of intensification — though not as sharp as what actually unfolded. “We used to say that the nightmare was that you go to bed with a tropical storm 36 hours from landfall and you wake up the next morning and it’s a Cat. 4 and you’ve got 12 hours left to evacuate. But what actually happened was worse than that imagined scenario: You woke up with a Cat. 5 and it was only a few hours from landfall. It’s a terrible tragedy,” he says. “I can’t imagine anything worse.”

For Emanuel, the key lesson from Otis is that we need to assess the possible course of storms probabilistically — understanding that, whatever the median projection for the intensity or course of a given hurricane, there is some chance of some low-likelihood, high-risk surprise. He also mentions a few variables that are not yet properly integrated into most forecasting tools — for instance, the relative salinity of the ocean surface and the way that it can affect the temperature gradients helping influence the intensity of a given storm. And over time, our models will surely improve, as modelers incorporate lessons from this hurricane and from the unprecedented environment in which it so spectacularly emerged.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,0,0,1,0.9838,[],"['Much', 'Acapulco']"
1013,2023-08-29,Hurricane Idalia Is Aiming for Florida’s Big Bend Region,"Hurricane Idalia is expected to make landfall early Wednesday along Florida’s Big Bend, a marshy coast of sparsely populated wetlands known for its freshwater springs and tiny fishing villages — including Cedar Key, a conglomeration of tiny islands connected by small bridges, where a deadly storm struck in 1896 and killed at least 70 people in Florida.

Forecasters said Idalia could cause up to 12 feet of storm surge in the Big Bend region, which is loosely defined as the area where the north-south portion of the Florida peninsula curves toward the east-west portion of the Panhandle.

The Big Bend was last hit by a hurricane in 2016, when Hermine, a Category 1 storm, came ashore there. The damage was limited, given the small population in the area. One person died. But a rare winter storm in March 1993 brought rushing Gulf waters into homes, and 47 people died, many by drowning.

Evacuations were ordered for Cedar Key on Monday, along with other coastal areas, including Yankeetown, Fowlers Bluff and Fanning Springs. Sue Colson, a Cedar Key city commissioner, said people who did not want to heed the orders had to prepare for the possibility that the only road in and out of town could be washed out, or that Cedar Key’s 700 homes — about two-thirds of which are vacation rentals — could be without power, water and sewer service for weeks.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,2,0,1,-0.9236,[],"['Bend', 'Florida']"
1014,2023-07-10,Officials say the flooding is the worst since Hurricane Irene.,"The flash floods across New England, New York and Quebec on Monday evoked frequent comparisons to Hurricane Irene, which inundated the region in 2011 after making landfall and being downgraded to a tropical storm. Irene killed at least 40 people in 11 states and caused more than $6.5 billion in damage.

Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont said he feared that the sheer volume of water dumped on his state by this week’s storm system could surpass the amount that fell during Irene, because the region will be pummeled by rain for several days.

“What’s different for me is that Irene lasted about 24 hours,” he said at a news conference on Monday morning. “We’re getting just as much rain, if not more, and it’s going on for days. That’s my concern. It’s not just the initial damage.”

The Winooski River running through Vermont’s capital of Montpelier is expected to crest on Tuesday at its second-highest level ever, at 19.8 feet. That’s almost a foot higher than the river reached after Tropical Storm Irene in 2011. The record-high crest — of over 27 feet — occurred during Vermont’s “greatest natural disaster,” the floods of November 1927, according to the National Weather Service.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,1,0,1,-0.8934,[],['New York']
1015,2020-09-15,Forecasters Are Running Out of Names This Hurricane Season. What Then?,"MIAMI — Not long before Hurricane Sally landed in Alabama as a Category 2 storm early Wednesday, Tropical Storms Teddy and Vicky were designated in the Atlantic as the season’s 19th and 20th named storms, each moving closer to the end of the alphabet.

The Atlantic hurricane season this year has stirred up storms at such a rapid rate that there is now only one entry — Wilfred — left on the 21-name list that meteorologists use for each season.

Forecasters say they are likely to exhaust the current list, given that this is the height of the season, which began on June 1 and ends on Nov. 30. This week, there were five named storms at once in the Atlantic, a phenomenon that has not happened since 1971, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (Tropical Depression Rene dissolved on Monday.)

“Considering we are at 20 named storms now — we’re just barely past the halfway point of the season — that’s a lot,” said Dennis Feltgen, a spokesman and meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center in Miami. “We still have two and a half months of the season to go.”",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.7096,[],['Miami']
1016,2022-09-28,What does Hurricane Ian mean for Florida’s wildlife?,"Florida’s native wildlife is well adapted to hurricanes, and species have all kinds of strategies for staying safe or rebounding quickly. For example, even though sea turtle nesting season overlaps with hurricane season and some eggs may be destroyed, many of the young have already hatched and crawled out to sea by the time the season really ramps up. Lots of wildlife in the state can even benefit from new habitat created by flooding and downed trees.

But increasingly, that natural resilience is compromised by two human-created problems.

First, many species are suffering declines driven by habitat loss and other factors. These depleted populations may be squeezed into limited parcels of land, making it much more difficult for them to bounce back after a storm.

Second, climate change is supercharging some hurricanes. Scientists are still learning what this means for wildlife. Bigger storms can wipe out important habitat on land and at sea.

One of Florida’s most beloved species, the manatee, can get trapped inland when floodwaters recede. As Ian progresses, experts are poised to rescue the animals when they can do so safely. They are also asking people to report stranded, injured or dead manatees to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,2,0,0,-0.7861,[],['Florida']

But it also strikes on a smaller, more intimate scale, in disrupted lives multiplied thousands of times over. How to measure the damage? In dollars or lost lives, certainly, or whole neighborhoods sunken in torrents of untamed water.

But also: a brother and sister huddling for warmth in an apartment without heat or electricity; a woman retrieving her furniture from her neighbor’s yard; a home aide helping a frail man onto an emergency cot; a rescue worker too fatigued to keep going, but keeping on anyway. When Hurricane Sandy hit New York City 10 years ago, leading to at least 43 deaths and an estimated $19 billion in damages, New York Times photographers fanned across the metropolitan area to document the devastated cityscape. But they also bore witness to the individual struggles of people trying to hang on to what they could.

The new normal was definitely not normal.

The city that the photographers ventured into during the storm and in the days afterward was not the one from a week earlier. Parts remained underwater or impassable. Whole areas were immersed in darkness. You could cross a block on Broadway in the mid-20s, and on one side, you would see a city without traffic signals, and on the other, one that appeared untouched by the storm. Everyone had a memory. Mine was of walking past a new apartment building, on the night of the storm, when a planter on a high terrace blew through the glass guardrail, showering pedestrians with glass splinters and the planter’s remains. My son’s was of hearing that two of his friends were killed by a falling tree.

Every corner of the city experienced a different storm, a different level of wrath — and a different recovery.

It’s one of the measures Greece is considering after facing weeks of scorching temperatures and wildfires this month. Some experts in Britain, the United States and other countries have also pushed for giving human names to heat waves and categorizing them based on their severity, on the grounds that designating names could help to raise awareness about the dangers of extreme heat.

Even though tropical cyclones typically garner more headlines, especially in the United States, heat waves can be deadlier. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that an average of 658 people were killed in the United States each year by extreme heat in the decade leading up to 2009, but experts say the number is much higher because death from heat strokes are often not categorized as such. An investigation by The New York Times showed that during the heat wave in the Pacific Northwest in late June, more than 600 people died than would have been typical in Oregon and Washington.

Nicole, the first hurricane to come ashore on the state’s Atlantic coast since Katrina in 2005, became a tropical storm shortly after making landfall as a Category 1 hurricane at around 3 a.m. south of Vero Beach. At least four deaths were attributed to the storm as it crossed the peninsula, and then swung offshore over the Gulf of Mexico and turned north, going back over land in the Big Bend region of Florida, just east of the Panhandle.

The storm mostly spared Southwest Florida, the area worst hit by Hurricane Ian, which slammed into the state as a Category 4 storm in September. But Ian was such a large system that it also damaged parts of the Atlantic coast, leaving them particularly vulnerable to Nicole, a far weaker storm.

The double whammy was most evident in Volusia County, where officials said that building inspectors had deemed 24 hotels and condominiums unsafe, leading to the evacuation of about 500 mostly older residents, according to a spokeswoman for Daytona Beach Shores.

1024,2022-11-02,Hurricane or Typhoon? How Tropical Cyclones Get Their Names.,"Whenever a tropical cyclone barrels toward the Southeastern United States, forecasters assign it a name and a category based on a grading system that is widely used for storms in the Atlantic Ocean.

But if a similar storm sweeps west across the Pacific Ocean, there is no such uniform system.

There are variations in how different regions of the world define tropical systems, including storms, depressions and cyclones. In the Western Pacific, the process is especially complex because countries and territories have their own systems for measuring, grading and naming tropical cyclones, which they call typhoons instead of hurricanes.

“In Asia it is a bit complicated,” said Clarence Fong, a meteorologist in Macau, a Chinese territory, who works for an intergovernmental committee under the World Meteorological Organization that coordinates typhoon warnings across the region.

Let us explain.

What cyclones have in common.

The scientific definition of a tropical cyclone is straightforward: It is a storm, typically with a diameter of around 200 to 500 kilometers (124 to 311 miles), that begins over a tropical ocean and generates violent winds, torrential rain, high waves and other bad weather.

After slamming coastal communities in the early hours of Thursday, the storm roared into the city of Lake Charles, La., ripping apart buildings and causing a fire at a chemical plant, which sent acrid smoke billowing into the sky and prompted the state to order people living nearby to stay inside with their windows shut.

Reed, an associate professor in the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook University and the lead author of the study. “It isn’t this end-of-the-century problem that we have to figure out if we can mitigate or adapt to,” he said. “It is impacting our weather and our extreme weather now.”

1033,2024-11-19,Atmospheric River and Hurricane-Strength Storm Drenches the West,"It’s early enough in the wet season that the risk of flooding is mitigated by the fact that the ground is still dry and the rivers aren’t high, Dr. Ralph said. Typically, concerns about more considerable flooding rise when atmospheric rivers come back to back. This storm could set the stage for events coming down the line, but could still cause some flooding along smaller creeks and streams throughout the North Bay.

A ‘triple-bomb cyclone’ in the Pacific

This atmospheric river is connected to a storm system swirling over the northeastern Pacific Ocean that reached the lowest barometric pressure reading ever recorded in that part of the ocean, forecasters said on Wednesday.

A storm’s pressure is an indication of its intensity, and this storm’s reading is expected to drop so quickly that meteorologists would call it a “bomb cyclone” — a storm that rapidly intensifies or dramatically drops in pressure in 24 hours. (The threshold measurement in millibars varies depending on the storm’s latitude.)

“Bomb cyclones” are more likely when there is an atmospheric river already present, Dr. Ralph said. The fact that there was already an atmospheric river where the cyclone began forming in the Pacific Ocean has given the storm more fuel.

The storm’s barometric pressure dropped to 942 millibars overnight, tying a storm that reached the same intensity on Oct. 24, 2021, in almost the same location. The 2021 storm also had an atmospheric river attached to it, which brought tropical downpours leading to power outages, landslides, and flooding to the San Francisco Bay Area and the highest ever recorded daily rainfall in Santa Rosa, which recorded 7.83 inches. National Weather Service forecasters say the current storm passed the bench mark for a “triple bomb,” when a storm’s pressure drops to a level three times the amount for a standard “bomb cyclone.”",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.9545,[],"['North Bay', 'Santa Rosa', 'San Francisco']"

The storm also heaved an unexpected type of debris onto one beach: blocks of cocaine worth about $1 million.

Debby, which made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of at least 74 miles per hour, blew 25 packages of cocaine onto a beach on the Florida Keys, according to Samuel Briggs II, the acting chief patrol agent for the U.S. Border Patrol in Miami.

All times on the map are Eastern. By The New York Times

Milton is the 13th named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,news analysis,0,0,0,0.9829,['United States'],"['New York', 'Key West', 'Milton']"

In the northeastern Pacific, storms have also been churning to life: So far this year, there have been 16 named storms, including six hurricanes, with more than a month remaining in the season.

The latest is Pamela, which made landfall on Mexico’s mainland on Wednesday as a hurricane.

The Pacific hurricane season begins on May 15, and like the Atlantic season, which begins on June 1, it runs through Nov. 30. But because of geography and wind patterns, among other factors, hurricanes in the Pacific tend to draw less attention than their Atlantic counterparts, even though they can still bring dangerous conditions to cities and ships.

Saturday: Tropical storm conditions spread northward across the Baja California. Rainfall begins north of the U.S.-Mexico border in California. The storm is expected to begin weakening.

Saturday evening and overnight: This is the earliest probable landfall along the Baja California peninsula, and hurricane conditions are probable along the west coast of Mexico. The storm will continue to rapidly weaken.

Sunday morning: Tropical-storm-force winds could begin to affect Southern California. Landfall is possible at any time if it has not occurred yet. However, forecasters said, the exact path and landfall are of little overall importance since strong winds and heavy rainfall will extend far from the center of the storm.

Sunday afternoon: Tropical-force winds are expected to spread across Southern California as the most torrential rain begins soaking the region. If the storm has not yet reached land, a first and even second landfall may be possible. Flash flooding, landslides, mudslides and debris flows over burn scars left by wildfires are expected, forecasters said.

“We consider ourselves fortunate that Hurricane Douglas veered away from our islands at the last minute, but we remain vigilant as always during hurricane season because all it takes is one storm to cause devastating damage and impacts for our residents,” Luke P. Meyers, the administrator of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, said.

While other storms have caused damage to the islands, only two in modern history have made landfall, according to the center: In 1992, Hurricane Iniki hit Kauai as a Category 4 storm, killing six people and causing about $3 billion in damage. In 1959, Hurricane Dot caused about $5.5 million in damage.

Though the islands avoided a direct hit, the combination of high water levels, storm surge and large breaking waves could raise water levels by as much as two feet above normal tides near the center of the storm, the center warned.

Forecasters predicted three to six inches of rain on the main Hawaiian islands, possibly contributing to flash flooding and landslides.

1044,2020-08-04,A History of Hurricanes in America and the Devastation They Have Wrought,"As the century wore on, one scientific breakthrough followed another. But little progress was made in the science of hurricane prediction, and even with the advent of the telegraph and the creation of the United States Weather Bureau, forecasting remained largely a matter of luck.

For instance, the Weather Bureau called for “light rain” in the New York area on the evening of Aug. 23, 1893; instead the city was hit by a Category 1 storm. Four days later, the bureau warned that a hurricane was about to make landfall near Savannah, but by that point, the Category 3 hurricane was already bearing down on the city and even those who received the alert had no time to prepare. Particularly devastated were the islands to the northeast of Savannah, off the coast of South Carolina, which were on the “dirty,” or right-hand, side of the storm. (In the Northern Hemisphere, hurricanes rotate in a counterclockwise direction; this means that whatever direction the storm is moving, the danger will be greatest to the right of the eye, because there the speed of the winds is increased by the forward velocity of the tempest.) Some 2,000 people were killed in the so-called Sea Islands Hurricane, most of them African-American. Relief was slow to reach the islands, in part because of all the damage and in part because South Carolina’s avowedly white supremacist governor delayed calling for help.

Four decades later, communications technologies — radio, telephone — had vastly improved, but, as Dolin recounts, the bureau’s forecasts had not. In the hours before the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 made landfall, the bureau missed the fact that the storm had taken a sharp northern turn; the result was that hundreds of unemployed World War I veterans who’d been sent to build a road connecting the Florida Keys were killed. Ernest Hemingway, who rode out the Labor Day Hurricane on Key West, visited the vets’ camp, on Lower Matecumbe Key, a few days after the disaster. (He’d been drinking buddies with many of the men.) The dead, he reported, were “everywhere and in the sun all of them were beginning to be too big for their bluejeans and jackets that they could never fill when they were on the bum and hungry.”",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,2,0,1,-0.9748,['United States'],"['New York', 'Savannah', 'Key West']"

Even though ferocious storms like Ian seem to make landfall with increasing regularity, insurers and environmentalists say that pricing the risk associated with these events will only get trickier.

Historical actuarial patterns that once helped insurers price premiums are becoming less relevant as severe weather caused by climate change becomes more frequent, said Don Bain, an engineer and senior adviser at the nonprofit group Climate Central. “The ability to price risk depends on modeling, and that modeling is stressed,” he told the DealBook newsletter.

Coastal communities could take a $108 billion hit by 2100, according to an analysis by Climate Central. Researchers predict “significant implications for both property owners and local property tax revenues” as sea levels rise and shift the tide lines that delineate boundaries between public and private property in some states. They estimate that up to 4.4 million acres may be below the relevant tidal boundary levels by 2050, with Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina and Texas most at risk.

“The Florida homeowners’ insurance market is in crisis,” said Kyle Ulrich, the head of the Florida Association of Insurance Agents, a trade group.

What does the storm look like from above?

Satellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.

By The New York Times

Where will it rain?

Flash flooding can occur well inland and away from the storm’s center. Even weaker storms can produce excessive rainfall that can flood low-lying areas.

Source: NOAA By The New York Times

Leslie is the 12th named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.9844,['United States'],['New York']

The 2023 hurricane seasons in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific came to an end this week, with both basins experiencing an above average number of storms, fueled by extremely warm ocean temperatures.

The two basins had a combined 37 storms, 13 of which rapidly intensified, sometimes jumping multiple hurricane categories in less than a day.

Eastern Pacific storms in 2023 Canada PACIFIC OCEAN United States Los Angeles Houston mexico Mexico City

A high proportion of rapid-onset storms this year exceeded the standard definition of rapid intensification — an increase of at least 35 miles per hour in sustained winds, over 24 hours. Experts said that this emphasized the way hurricane seasons are changing and the need for more reliable forecast models.

When storms intensify abruptly near land, it becomes more difficult to predict how severely places will be affected, and it leaves officials and residents with little time to prepare.

Newer and more specific hurricane intensity models, like the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS), helped experts forecast some of this rapid strengthening, but some storms still caught meteorologists by surprise. In one major hurricane, at least 50 people died because conditions worsened precipitously in a matter of hours.

El Nino’s impact in a year with record ocean heat

El Niño, a weather pattern that recurs every few years, typically suppresses the formation of hurricanes in the Atlantic and increases storm activity in the Eastern Pacific. This hurricane season, however, was very active on both sides of North America, partly because of increased ocean temperatures across the Eastern Pacific and the Atlantic. Each year, the season runs from May 15 until Nov. 30 in the Eastern Pacific and from June 1 until Nov. 30 in the Atlantic.

The warm waters across the Atlantic helped storms to overcome a weather phenomenon called wind shear, which was exacerbated by El Niño. With wind shear, changes in wind speed and direction with altitude can disrupt the structure of cyclonic storms as they form.

During the Atlantic hurricane season, 20 storms formed, seven of which reached hurricane strength, ​​meaning sustained winds of at least 74 miles per hour. Three of those were major hurricanes, each of which rapidly intensified. Storms are given names when their winds reach or exceed 39 miles per hour, the threshold for a tropical storm.

The El Niño weather pattern led to 17 named storms in the Eastern Pacific. Of those, 10 rapidly intensified into hurricanes, and eight of those became major hurricanes — Category 3 or higher — with winds of at least 111 m.p.h.

This summer’s record high ocean temperatures were most likely enhanced by El Niño, but experts say the underlying influence of human-driven climate change is undeniable. And research by scientists has concluded that rapid intensification is increasing because of global warming.

“Such warm water ‘sets the stage’ for these events,” James P. Kossin, a climate scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, wrote in an email.

“There is no question that the warming oceans have a human fingerprint on them,” said Dr. Kossin. “But this should be tempered when adding an El Niño event into the mix.” Without careful analysis, it is difficult to say how much El Niño conditions played into an individual storm’s rapid intensification versus how much climate change played a role.

In a 2019 study, experts stated that storms that rapidly intensify are typically associated with more forecast errors and cause a disproportionate amount of human and financial losses.

Extremely rapid intensification is an increase of at least 58 m.p.h. within a 24-hour period.

Philip Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University, said the Atlantic was near normal when it came to the number of storms that went through rapid intensification.

In the Pacific, things were a bit different. Even though the season was only slightly above average and did not have as many named storms as the Atlantic, “it was quite amped for rapid intensification,” said Dr. Klotzbach. There were 17 named storms in an area that normally experiences about 15. But 10 of those went through rapid intensification, which is almost double the normal amount.

Dr. Klotzbach said that this year was also notable for the number of storms that intensified even faster than the “garden variety” of storms that meet the minimum definition of rapid intensification. In his analysis, Dr. Klotzbach said that the number of storms that “really rapidly intensified,” or strengthened by 58 m.p.h. or higher in 24 hours, was above average in both the Atlantic and the East Pacific.

In the Eastern Pacific, six of the 10 storms that rapidly intensified met Dr. Klotzbach’s higher threshold of intensification. An average season would typically have only two storms that would escalate this quickly.

In the Atlantic, two storms, Hurricanes Lee and Idalia, reached this extreme level of intensification. The Atlantic typically has only one.

Three storms that intensified close to land illustrate how damaging these quickly strengthening storms can be. One storm generated storm surge that reached as high as 12 feet, another devastated a major tourist destination and another turned parts of a desert into a swamp. It is critical for people in harm’s way to have as early of an indication as possible that a storm may reach catastrophic wind speeds, to give time to board up buildings and evacuate.

Advance warning in Florida

Of the three storms that made landfall in the eastern United States this season, only one was a hurricane. The initial forecast track accurately showed a landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region. And specialized weather models, which were created to help predict rapid intensification, showed the storm becoming more intense. When the storm was southwest of Cuba, forecasters warned that it could become a powerful hurricane and hit the United States two days later.

On the other side of the country, in a state more well known for atmospheric rivers than hurricanes, a storm that intensified by 75 m.p.h. in 24 hours led to at least one death in Mexico and rare warnings in California.

Text appears over a map that is tracking a storm’s path. Once the storm was named Hilary on Aug. 16, forecasters immediately began predicting that it would rapidly intensify.

“Nobody saw that rapid intensification coming,” Dr. Klotzbach said.

Text appears over a map that is tracking a storm’s path. The storm began to organize itself on Oct. 22, first as a tropical depression.

The background graphic animates to show the tropical storm moving towards Acapulco, Mexico, on Oct. 23. By Oct. 23, the models started indicating that the storm could become a hurricane, and forecasters said that with the abundant amount of moisture in the area and warm ocean temperatures, the storm would strengthen gradually. They did not expect the monster it would become. Background map shows the sea surface temperature ranging from 79.7 to 91.4 degrees Fahrenheit, with warmer water near the shoreline and in the path of the storm. On Oct. 24, the unforeseen happened. The storm jumped five categories, strengthening from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane — the highest level — in less than 24 hours. The background graphic shows the storm moving from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane before making landfall on Oct. 25. Eric Blake, a forecaster with the National Hurricane Center, called it a “nightmare scenario” in an advisory released that evening. The background graphic shows the storm moving inland, as it weakens to a Category 2 hurricane on Oct. 25.

Otis strengthened by 115 m.p.h. in 24 hours, over three times the minimum level of rapid intensification, leaving the more than one million people living in and around the city very little time for emergency planning and response.

By mid-November, Mexican officials said that at least 49 people had died, and 26 were still missing. Yet more people could be missing, especially those who worked on yachts and boats in the tourism industry.

Rapidly intensifying storms near coastlines, like Otis, are becoming more common, posing a major threat to people living in those areas, according to a study published in August.

But despite extreme natural disasters this year, including earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, and Cyclone Freddy in Southern Africa, as well as wars in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, countries have failed to donate anywhere near the $57 billion target. Although donations always fall short of the total requested, funding for U.N. aid programs actually dropped in 2023 for the first time in 13 years — through the end of November, they had received a total of only $20 billion, $4 billion less than the previous year.

1081,2023-11-20,‘A Beautiful Place That Has a Dragon’: Where Hurricane Risk Meets Booming Growth,"Hurricanes have always struck the shores of the United States.



But in recent decades, the combination of climate change and a growing coastal population has made them far more damaging — particularly in one corner of the Atlantic coast.

At the crossroads of these hurricanes lie the metro areas of Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Wilmington, N.C.

Between 2016 and 2022, the Carolinas were hit by five hurricanes: Matthew, Florence, Dorian, Isaias and Ian.

But some of the most hurricane-prone parts of the country lie further northeast, on the Carolina coast.

Gulf Coast regions like coastal Louisiana and Florida frequently encounter powerful hurricanes, of course.

Roughly 150 Atlantic hurricanes have approached or directly hit the United States in the last seven decades.

These two metros, known for their striking coastlines, have been regularly battered by hurricanes this century.



They also have something else in common: Both are among the fastest-growing coastal metros in the United States since 2000.



Why do so many people decide to move here despite the risks?



And what does that mean for everyone else?

‘A Beautiful Place That Has a Dragon’: Where Hurricane Risk Meets Booming Growth

The hurricanes keep coming, and the people, too: The fastest-growing places along the Atlantic coast this century are also among the most hurricane-prone.

Between 2016 and 2022, the five hurricanes that hit the Carolinas cost the two states over $33 billion in damages in current dollars, displaced hundreds of thousands of people and led to the deaths of more than 90, government data shows.

There’s every reason to expect more damage in coming years: A warming climate adds moisture to the air, unlocking the potential for wetter and more powerful storms. And rising sea levels make storm surges more damaging and coastal flooding more frequent.

And the newcomers will keep coming: One 2022 study projected that by 2050, population growth will increase the number of Americans exposed to flooding nearly four times as much as climate change will alone.

Simply put, there are many more people living along the paths of hurricanes than ever before. And this booming coastal population is, by many accounts, a larger contributor to rising hurricane risks than climate change.

“It’s always climate change plus something, and we’re moving more people into harm’s way than out,” said Kathie Dello, North Carolina’s state climatologist.

Local officials say they are struggling to keep up with the growth. They can try to manage the floodplain, communicate the risks, regulate construction and prepare for disasters. But the one thing they can’t seem to do is stop people from moving here.

Many retirees are drawn to the Carolinas’ beaches and waterways, moderate temperatures and low taxes. Between 1990 and 2020, the number of people 65 and older grew by nearly 450 percent combined in Horry County, S.C., and adjoining Brunswick County, N.C.

When Gail Hart moved from Arizona to retire in Wilmington, N.C., in 2017, she hadn’t considered the hurricane risk. “I wanted to be near a beach,” she said. “I wanted a community.”

The next year, Hurricane Florence made landfall in the Wilmington metro area. Many neighborhoods flooded. In some places, three feet of water entered homes. Emergency officials rescued over a thousand residents.

Ms. Hart evacuated. She was fortunate: Her home suffered only minor wind damage. But the experience changed her view of living there. She installed storm shutters and a generator, and bought flood insurance. And yet, like so many others, she has stayed despite the storm risks.

“I don’t let it affect my life unless there’s a hurricane coming,” she said.

Ms. Hart is far from alone. When she arrived, there were about a dozen homes in her retirement community. Today there are over 500.

In a retirement community being built across the road, acres of pine forests have been cleared to develop homes along the Cape Fear River.

New homes on the banks of the Cape Fear River in Wilmington, N.C.

Nearby, marshland with ghost forests of dead trees was up for sale as “riverfront condo land.”

Ghost forests are what remains of woodlands when saltwater poisons the roots of trees.

Wilmington is part of New Hanover County, the most densely populated of the state’s coastal counties. Nearly 40 percent of its homes risk being severely affected by flooding in the next 30 years, according to the First Street Foundation.

“There’s just not a lot of area left,” said Steven Still, director of emergency services for the county. “So you’re developing in the fringe areas.”

The escalating costs of storms raise a difficult question for these growing coastal communities: How do you balance growth with safety?

The combination of climate change and development in risky areas is making it “a huge challenge” to keep residents safe, said Amanda Martin, North Carolina’s chief resilience officer.

Hurricanes near U.S. counties, 1950-2022 Coastal Carolina counties have some of the highest hurricane frequencies in the country. Source: Upshot analysis of the National Hurricane Center's Atlantic hurricane database The map shows the number of Atlantic hurricanes whose paths came within 60 nautical miles (69 miles) of each county.

It’s not just that people are moving to hurricane-prone areas. The growth itself can make flooding worse. Cutting down trees and paving over wetlands takes away open land that would otherwise absorb rainfall.

“We just seem to be going through this vicious cycle that is becoming more vicious with the amount of people and infrastructure we put in these areas,” Mr. Still said.

Federal law permits people to build in flood zones, so long as they meet certain minimum standards. In return, the government offers them flood insurance through a federal program that is over $20 billion in debt — largely due to escalating hurricane damages.

While the National Flood Insurance Program was originally intended to discourage floodplain development, in practice it has done the opposite by removing a lot of the financial risk involved, said Jenny Brennan, a climate analyst at the Southern Environmental Law Center.

States have a few options to discourage people from building in flood zones. They can create more stringent building requirements, or they can buy up and preserve undeveloped land. But these measures are expensive, and rely on political will or the willingness of landowners to sell.

One way that states can move residents out of harm’s way is by offering to buy out their homes and permanently converting that land to open space. But a study this year found that for every home bought out in North Carolina between 1996 and 2017, more than 10 new ones were built in the state’s floodplains.

The growth also makes it more difficult to evacuate when storms strike. In these booming coastal counties, residents and local officials say that roads and bridges are not keeping pace with the growth.

“Our biggest problem is our infrastructures not being able to keep up,” said David McIntire, the deputy director of emergency management for Brunswick County, the fastest-growing coastal county in North Carolina this century and part of the Wilmington metro.

The state has undertaken a multiyear project to add two lanes to Highway 211, the main evacuation route for the region. Mr. McIntire said the state and local departments were “having to play catch-up” after years of failing to plan ahead.

In neighboring New Hanover County, his counterpart Mr. Still is grappling with a shortage of affordable housing, which he said was making it “exponentially difficult” to shelter people displaced by disasters.

After a disaster, the surge in demand for short-term housing drives up already high rents. Poorer residents often rely on the state and local governments for assistance with evacuation and housing.

The problem lies in where to house them. “If there is zero housing availability in the community right now,” Mr. Still said, “where do you put 100,000 people?”

The housing crunch is one of many tensions playing out between wealthy coastal communities and those who live nearby.

April O’Leary lives in Conway, S.C., an inland city in Horry County, a half-hour drive from Myrtle Beach.

The county makes up the Myrtle Beach metro area, which was the fastest-growing coastal metro nationally between 2000 and 2020 and is one of the fastest-growing places in the country annually. And the growth is projected to continue.

Horry County is large and flat: Nearly a quarter of its land lies within a floodplain.

In inland towns like Conway, S.C., floodwaters can stay long after a hurricane is gone.

After Hurricane Florence made landfall, it took about a week for the rainwater to flow down to Conway. But the water stayed for over a week.

“It sits for a while and it just destroys everything,” Ms. O’Leary said.

Water entered her home, flooding the first floor and a bedroom. Her husband and son evacuated to Myrtle Beach, while she stayed for a few days to document the floods.

Afterward, there were large piles of debris lining street after street in her neighborhood, filled with ruined flooring, kitchen cabinets and bathroom fixtures.

When her son’s elementary school reopened and he saw the devastation in the neighborhood, she said he stopped smiling and became quieter for months.

Down the street from April O’Leary’s home, in Conway, S.C., the flood water line from Hurricane Florence was still visible.

After the flooding, Ms. O’Leary founded Horry County Rising, a political organization that campaigned for the county to adopt stricter regulations for floodplain construction. Much of the flooding in the Carolinas during Hurricane Florence occurred outside of federal flood zones, where few people have flood insurance or homes that are protected from flooding.

In 2021, the county expanded its flood zone boundaries to include places that flooded during Hurricane Florence. And it required new homes built there to have their lowest floor three feet above the high water mark.

The changes applied to all unincorporated parts of the county. But they faced pushback from local developers because of raised building costs. The county recently voted to lower the height requirements to two feet, after legal pressure from a developer.

The flooding and growth also affect rural communities that have been rooted in the Carolinas for generations. In Bucksport, S.C., a small inland town in Horry County, Kevin Mishoe is a third-generation farmer and former chair of the Association for the Betterment of Bucksport.

He said the newer building codes would pay dividends in future floods, but they would also make home ownership far more expensive for people in lower-income communities like Bucksport.

Bucksport sits between two major rivers, nestled against wetlands and tidal forests. Mr. Mishoe lives with his wife in a mobile home that flooded during Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018.

Gina and Kevin Mishoe outside their home in Bucksport, S.C.

Mr. Mishoe says he believes banks are denying loans to residents because of their location in a floodplain, a phenomenon he called “bluelining.”

Meanwhile, he said, locals are being “bombarded” with offers from developers and private equity companies to buy their land.

“All of a sudden land that you’re telling us is almost worthless because you’re in a flood zone, everybody’s trying to buy,” he said.

The area is considered prime real estate because of its access to water. This year, the county expressed support for a highway that would connect Myrtle Beach to inland parts of the county. The highway is expected to cut through Bucksport and its adjoining wetlands, and bring added development to the region.

The town’s residents emphatically do not want to sell their land, Mr. Mishoe said. Their ancestors have held on to this land for generations, and they intend to stay.

Bucksport’s flooding problem began in 2015. But there are coastal Carolina communities that have endured regular hurricanes for over a century.

Karen Willis Amspacher lives on Harkers Island in Carteret County, N.C. — one of the most hurricane-prone counties in the country.

The island is part of a string of low-lying rural communities near the Outer Banks that locals call Down East. The communities are connected by Highway 70, a dredged road that floods several times a year.

Highway 70 outside Stacy, N.C., in Carteret County.

Ms. Amspacher is a fifth-generation resident of the island and the director of the Core Sound Waterfowl Museum. There are a lot of newer residents, she said, moving into large houses on stilts, with generators and flood insurance. Some houses are second homes or vacation properties.

The construction boom has driven up costs for locals. “The fear and threat of sea level rise or storms doesn't hinder any of it,” she said.

A raised home under construction on Harkers Island, N.C.

A new bridge under construction earlier this year will connect Harkers Island to the mainland, to improve evacuations during hurricanes.

While the new homes may be safer, Ms. Amspacher said, many of the newcomers are isolated from the emotional trauma that her community experiences during a hurricane.

“This is a piece of property to them,” she said. “It’s not their family inheritance. It’s not their home. It’s not where they hope their children will stay and grow up.”

Ms. Amspacher has had to evacuate her home in three past hurricanes. But she’s not planning to leave for the next one. She said staying during storms was a way to protect property from damage, and was part of her community’s cultural identity.

“These hurricanes make these communities what we are,” she said.

Back in Wilmington, Sharon Valentine is also no stranger to hurricanes. She owned a large animal farm near Fayetteville, N.C., which was devastated by Hurricane Fran in 1996.

So when she and her partner decided to retire in Wilmington’s Del Webb community in 2017, they knew the risks.

Many others have followed since. “There’s a mass migration down here,” she said.

Ms. Valentine organizes annual hurricane training for these newer arrivals. The community members have evacuation plans and look out for one another.

Sharon Valentine and Leonard Bull keep an emergency go bag, which they call a “calamity box,” at their home in Wilmington.

She, too, said the local infrastructure hadn’t kept up with growth. There are two small bridges on either end of River Road that serve as the main evacuation routes for her community. She is concerned that they may flood in a major storm.

“If we really ever have a bad one, we’re going to have to get out of here,” Ms. Valentine said.

Still, when she thinks about all the newcomers, she sympathizes with their reasons for moving here.

“It is a beautiful place that has a dragon emerge periodically,” she said. “And so you weigh your risks.”",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,news analysis,3,3,2,-0.999,['United States'],"['Carolina', 'Federal', 'Myrtle Beach', 'Florence', 'Wilmington', 'Conway', 'Tula', 'Fayetteville', 'Much', 'Florida']"
1082,2024-10-02,The People Fleeing Climate Disasters Are Going to Transform the American South,"One study by the First Street Foundation, a research firm that studies climate threats to housing, found that roughly 3.2 million Americans have already migrated, many over short distances, out of flood zones, such as low-lying parts of Staten Island, Miami and Galveston, Texas. Over the next 30 years, 7.5 million more are projected to leave those perennially flooded zones, according to the study.

All of this suggests a possible boom for inland and Northern cities. But it also will leave behind large swaths of coastal and other vulnerable land where older adults and the poor are very likely to disproportionately remain.

The Southern United States stands to be especially transformed. Extreme heat, storms and coastal flooding will weigh heavily on the bottom third of this country, making the environment less comfortable and life within it more expensive and less prosperous.

The young, mobile and middle class will be more likely to leave to chase opportunity and physical and economic safety. That means government — from local to federal — must now recognize its responsibility to support the communities in climate migration’s wake. Even as an aging population left behind will require greater services, medical attention and physical accommodation, the residents that remain will reside in states that may also face diminished representation in Congress, because their communities are shrinking. Local governments could be left to fend alone, but with an evaporating tax base to work with.

In December, the First Street Foundation created one of the first clear pictures of how this demographic change is unfolding. It looked at flood risk and migration patterns down to the census tract, across the country, and identified hundreds of thousands of so-called abandonment zones where the out-migration of residents in response to rising risk had already passed a tipping point, and people were making small, local moves to higher ground.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,0.9105,['United States'],"['Staten Island', 'Miami', 'Texas', 'Galveston']"

The blue-green blooms, also called cyanobacteria, can kill wildlife. For humans, long-term exposure — through skin contact, drinking water, eating contaminated food, or breathing airborne particles — can cause liver damage and neurological disease.

As of Tuesday morning, the water level in Lake Okeechobee was just over 15 feet above sea level, about a foot below where it could endanger the surrounding dike.

The tropical storm had sustained wind speeds of 40 miles per hour.

All times on the map are Mexico Central Time. By The New York Times

What does the storm look like from above?

Satellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.

By The New York Times

Storms that form in the Atlantic or the Pacific generally move west, meaning Atlantic storms pose a greater threat to North America. If a storm forms in the Pacific close to land, it can bring damaging winds and rain before pushing out to sea.

However, an air mass can sometimes block a storm, driving it north or northeast toward the Baja California peninsula and the west coast of Mexico. Occasionally, a storm can move farther north, as Hurricane Hilary did last year, bringing damaging winds and intense rain to Southern California.

Hurricane season in the Eastern Pacific began on May 15, two weeks before the Atlantic season started. Both seasons run through Nov. 30.

Another factor for storm-watchers this year is the likely development of La Niña, the intermittent, large-scale atmospheric pattern that can affect weather worldwide.

In the Pacific Ocean, La Niña increases wind shear, which is a change in wind speed and/or direction with height. Those changes make it more difficult for storms to form. (In the Atlantic, La Niña has the opposite effect, reducing wind shear and increasing the chances for storm formation.)",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.7425,['Mexico'],['New York']

1088,2022-10-13,Hurricane Ian Proved Why Ron DeSantis’s Version of Climate Resilience Is a Disaster,"Hurricane Ian has revealed in brutal detail the inadequacy of his approach.

The sea walls, sewage pump stations, wastewater treatment plants and “living shorelines” that taxpayers funded did little to help inland towns like Arcadia. Hundreds of Central Florida homes remain flooded two weeks on, as rivers flush out the heavy rain. One study found that climate change may have added 10 percent to Ian’s rainfall.

Protecting Florida from the effects of future storms like Ian calls for more than just resilience. It calls for carefully retreating from the rising water and rebuilding where it’s safe. But retreat has never been in Governor DeSantis’s plan. There has been little to no attempt by his administration to stop further development in vulnerable coastal areas. As recently as August, Mr. DeSantis and his cabinet approved a high-rise resort development in Fort Myers Beach, where evacuation times already exceeded state regulations.

Expensive resilience projects like the ones the governor has supported can only ever be a temporary fix. As the sea level rises, they will have to be replaced, made higher, built larger. A bridge that’s been raised by a foot will have to be raised another foot and then another. The same goes for the sea walls and other infrastructure. They don’t address the cause of climate change, only the symptoms, and only for a little while.

If Governor DeSantis ever gets serious about a changing climate, the place to start is with the emissions that are also driving Florida’s other dangerous impacts: the intensifying heat waves that put outdoor workers at risk of dehydration and death, the warmer ocean waters causing rapid intensification of storms like Ian and the toxic algae blooms, which are also exacerbated by pollution.

The governor has gone in the other direction. Rather than encouraging homes and businesses to switch to renewable energy or requiring any retreat from the growing risks of climate-fueled devastation, he has taken steps to protect the oil and gas industry spewing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Last year he signed off on a bill that prevents local governments from trying to force the state’s powerful utilities to switch to cleaner energy sources. And he recently prohibited the state’s nearly $180 billion pension fund from taking environmental, social and governance metrics into account when making investment decisions.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,1,0,0,0.9374,[],"['Arcadia', 'Florida', 'Fort Myers']"

What does the storm look like from above?

Satellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.

By The New York Times

Kirk is the 11th named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.9844,['United States'],"['Leer', 'New York']"

Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses were without power for days. Ida damaged or destroyed 31,000 poles that carry lower-voltage distribution lines in neighborhoods, nearly twice as many as Hurricane Katrina, according to Entergy.

Lawmakers and regulators require utilities to ensure safe, reliable service at an affordable cost. The grid failure after Ida is the latest display of how power companies are struggling to fulfill those obligations as climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather. In California, electricity providers have been forced to shut off power to tens of thousands of customers in recent years to prevent their equipment from setting off wildfires and to reduce energy demand during heat waves. In February, the grid in most of Texas failed during a winter storm, leaving millions of people without power and heat for days.

While Entergy has been upgrading its transmission network to bear wind speeds in excess of 140 miles per hour, a lot of its transmission equipment in and around New Orleans was built to withstand wind gusts of around 110 miles per hour, or a Category 2 storm, according to an analysis of regulatory filing and other company records by McCullough Research, a consulting firm based in Portland, Ore., that advises power companies and government agencies.

Entergy said that analysis was inaccurate but wouldn’t say how many of its transmission structures were built to withstand 150 mile-per-hour winds. The company has said that its towers met the safety standards in place at the time of installation but older standards often assumed wind speeds well below 150 m.p.h.

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a professional group whose guidelines are widely followed by utilities and other industries, recommends that power companies that operate in areas vulnerable to hurricanes install equipment that can withstand major storms and return service quickly when systems fail. In coastal areas of Louisiana, for example, it says large transmission equipment should be designed to withstand winds of 150 m.p.h.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.5834,[],"['Portland', 'Texas', 'New Orleans']"

The system had sustained wind speeds of 35 miles per hour.

All times on the map are Eastern. By The New York Times

What does the storm look like from above?

Satellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.

By The New York Times

Joyce is the 10th named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.9845,['United States'],['New York']
1120,2021-06-11,"With Start of Hurricane Season, It’s Time to Consider Flood Insurance","This year’s hurricane season began early, with a named storm forming before the official start on June 1, and it is expected to be active. If you lack flood insurance, especially if you live near the coast, this is the time to consider it.

Standard homeowner insurance policies don’t cover damage from flooding, so you’ll need to buy a separate policy to protect your property. Most flood policies in the United States are issued through the National Flood Insurance Program, managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency — although options are increasingly available from private insurers in some areas.

FEMA is scheduled to change the way it prices policies beginning this fall, as part of an overhaul of the flood insurance program to better reflect climate risks. Some members of Congress, however, have signaled opposition to the changes, citing concerns about affordability. The aim is to more accurately reflect the risks that homeowners face, but some people may end up paying much higher rates.

After North Carolina’s Peeks Creek landslide in 2004, Brad Johnson, an environmental science professor at Davidson College, and a group of scientists found that five inches of rain was likely the tipping point for landslides in the region.

Mr. Hembree, who is retired from a job cleaning oil tankers and uses a wheelchair, was staying at a shelter at Erwin Technical College that had been designated for people with special needs.

“I live two blocks from the Hillsborough River,” he said as he took a drag of a cigarillo outside the building. “We’re not going through this again.”

Instead of bringing storm surge to Tampa Bay — one of forecasters’ biggest fears when it comes to storms hitting Florida — Hurricane Ian pushed the water out, leaving it less than a foot deep in some areas. The phenomenon, which also occurred during Hurricane Irma, is sometimes referred to as a reverse, or negative, storm surge. Winds to the north of the storm blew in from the east, pushing water away from the shoreline, said Christopher Slocum, a physical scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Florida has one of the most rigorous building codes in the country, a result of construction rules adopted after Hurricane Andrew destroyed tens of thousands of homes in South Florida in 1992. In more recent storms, such as Hurricane Irma, structures built under modern codes have performed better than older buildings. By contrast, in states without mandatory and up-to-date building codes, such as Tennessee and Kentucky, the damage from extreme weather events tends to be far worse.

1133,2024-09-26,Helene’s Intensification Was ‘Aggressive.’ Here’s Why.,"This month, the Gulf of Mexico is obliterating records for Ocean heat content, according to records by Dr. McNoldy. Ocean heat content is a sort of fuel for hurricanes — the higher the amount, the greater the influence it can have on storms like Helene.

The water Helene was traversing Thursday is roughly the ideal temperature for a warm bath. The storm is moving directly over the Loop Current — a steady, strong current of warmer water that moves from the Caribbean and loops like a horseshoe in the eastern Gulf before moving through the straights of Florida. Storms traversing the Loop Current, like Hurricane Michael in October 2018, often get enough energy from the warm water to rapidly intensify.

In addition to the warm ocean temperature, storms tend to intensify “when winds don’t change a lot with height,” Mr. McNoldy said. Wind shear can separate the top of the center of the storm from the bottom, which keeps the eye from strengthening. With little shear forecast over the Gulf Thursday, the storm will likely intensify quickly.

At a storm briefing on Tuesday morning, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida expressed concern over the speed of the storm’s development.

“They’ve never in their history forecasted a major hurricane at this stage of development,” he said. “When it’s over the Gulf, especially the more north it goes rather than east, it has a chance to have a rapid intensification.”",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,0,0,0,0.9812,['Mexico'],['Florida']

The pecan crop is particularly vulnerable. Georgia produces 88 million pounds of pecans a year, more than any other state, according to the University of Georgia. The $400 million crop is mostly in the southern part of the state, which places it in the direct path of the storm.

Farmers who are just starting to harvest nuts in anticipation of the holiday baking season are worried. The big concern is wind, which can both blow nuts off branches before they are harvested and knock down trees. The earliest varieties were already being harvested, but most of the crop is usually gathered in October. Unlike an almond tree, which can start bearing nuts in three to five years, some varieties of pecan trees can take up to 25 years to mature.

1135,2023-08-20,Hurricane Franklin Weakens in the North Atlantic,"Wait, one storm can absorb another?

It can! Here’s how that works.

Jose was weak compared with Franklin, which was the Atlantic’s first major hurricane of the year and stayed at that level for days. As Franklin weakens, it will transition into a more typical storm system with warm fronts and cold fronts, instead of a solid warm cored tropical cyclone.

By Friday night, after doing a little dance called the Fujiwhara effect, Jose was absorbed by Franklin. Think of it less like Pac-Man eating a ghost and more like a sponge absorbing water.

The Fujiwhara effect happens when two storms orbit around a shared center point. The effect was named for a Japanese meteorologist, Sakuhei Fujiwhara, who first described the interaction between whirling masses of fluid or air in 1921.

The effect is much more common with cyclones in the west Pacific, but it does happen in the Atlantic.

What does the storm look like from above?

Satellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.

By The New York Times

Where will it rain?

Flash flooding can occur well inland and away from the storm’s center. Even weaker storms can produce excessive rainfall that can flood low-lying areas.

Source: NOAA By The New York Times

Isaac is the ninth named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.9844,['United States'],"['Leer', 'New York']"

More than 150,000 homes flooded and over 80 Texans lost their lives.

In Friendswood, a middle-class Houston suburb of about 40,000 where we interviewed residents immediately after the storm and followed them for the next two years, more than 3,000 homes, one-third of the city’s total, flooded. A majority of these homes were not in officially designated floodplains when the storm hit, so few owners had flood insurance.

After striking Canada as a Category 1 hurricane and causing widespread power outages in Newfoundland, Larry moved north toward Greenland, where the storm stayed out to sea but brought a hurricane season oddity to some parts of the island: snow caused by the remnants of a tropical storm.

Meteorologists from the Danish Meteorological Institute, which provides forecasts for Greenland, said the storm was expected to remain southeast of the Danish territory’s southern tip on Sunday as it continued on a path through the Denmark Strait.

In the southern parts of Greenland, where most residents live, there was some snow but not as much as expected, said Lars Demant-Poort, an assistant professor of natural geography at the University of Greenland.

Many public schools in the area canceled classes for Monday, officials said. Officials encouraged residents to remain in their homes, if safe, on Sunday afternoon as repairs continued.

Port aux Basques, a community of about 3,600 people on the southwestern tip of Newfoundland, was inundated by more than three feet of storm surge, with large pounding waves, according to a government update on Sunday.

The facility features backup fuel supplies and on-site sewage treatment, and its critical mechanical and electrical equipment are at least 20 feet above the 100-year floodplain, or the area that would be inundated by a severe flood.

Researchers emphasized, though, that hospital preparedness should not stop at making individual hospitals more resilient. Even if hospital buildings themselves are not flooded, the roads leading to them may still be, effectively cutting off a functional hospital from patients who are trying to reach it, Dr. Bernstein said.

In 18 of the metropolitan areas, at least half of the roads within a mile of the hospitals were at risk of flooding from a Category 2 storm, the researchers said. Hospitals cannot be “a resilient island in a fragile ocean,” said Auroop R. Ganguly, a geosciences and civil engineering professor at Northeastern University who was not involved in the study.

Dr. Bernstein also emphasized that health care providers in some major cities, like New York, Boston and Philadelphia, might face much higher risk than expected. Because of where the hospitals are located and the numbers of hospital beds relative to the populations they serve, when a storm does hit, there will be “more people searching for fewer beds,” he said.

The study contributes to a better understanding of how to characterize the damage that a hurricane can inflict on the communities it hits, said Kristie L. Ebi, a professor in the University of Washington’s Center for Health and the Global Environment who wasn’t involved in the study.

BAYOU LA BATRE, Ala. — Hurricane Sally parked itself over the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, churning slowly and lumbering at a sluggish pace toward land, representing a climate change reality that has made many hurricanes wetter, slower and more dangerous.

Sally’s outer bands unleashed a relentless rain that began in the morning and continued unabated all day and into the night, threatening to deluge coastal communities in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi. Meteorologists worried — and almost marveled — as the storm pushed forward at a speed of just 2 miles per hour, shifting erratically in its path and intensity.

It Was the Heat.,"Only in recent days, as the last lights flickered back on in New Orleans, have officials here discovered the true toll of Hurricane Ida. Unlike in the Northeast, where many who perished were taken by floodwaters and tornadoes, heat has emerged as the greatest killer in New Orleans.

Of 14 deaths caused by the storm in the city, Mr. Joseph’s and nine others are believed to be tied to the heat. Experts say there are probably more.

In New Orleans, officials set up air-conditioned cooling centers across the city and distributed food, water and ice around town. But for residents like Mr. Joseph who could not leave their buildings, the aid might as well have been worlds away.

Helene’s center was identified late on Tuesday morning, and that can have a significant influence on the forecast track of the storm. It gives forecasters and computer models a more accurate place to start from. And so the puzzle pieces began to fit together enough for forecasters to have some confidence in saying that Helene will likely turn into a major hurricane before making landfall along Florida’s Big Bend.

The storm’s center can wobble and move before it strengthens into a hurricane, said John Cangialosi, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Weather Service, on Tuesday. The track guidance from weather models is very tightly clustered, which typically means forecasters would have strong confidence in where the storm will go. Until now, it has not been easy to locate a center, and those models might be off slightly. So forecasters warned in an update on Tuesday to prepare for the possibility that the entire guidance could shift east or west.

Some models show the storm growing weaker and tracking west, and others much stronger and east. At the same time, most show something in between and point at the Big Bend. All of these solutions are on the table, and a high-altitude hurricane hunter flight took off from Florida early on Tuesday afternoon to investigate the steering currents and hopefully provide data that will help the later computer models.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,0,0,0,0.9594,[],['Florida']

By The New York Times

John is the 10th named storm to form in the Eastern Pacific in 2024.

Storms that form in the Atlantic or the Pacific generally move west, meaning Atlantic storms pose a greater threat to North America. If a storm forms in the Pacific close to land, it can bring damaging winds and rain before pushing out to sea.

However, an air mass can sometimes block a storm, driving it north or northeast toward the Baja California peninsula and the west coast of Mexico. Occasionally, a storm can move farther north, as Hurricane Hilary did last year, bringing damaging winds and intense rain to Southern California.

Hurricane season in the Eastern Pacific began on May 15, two weeks before the Atlantic season started. Both seasons run through Nov. 30.

Another factor for storm-watchers this year is the likely development of La Niña, the intermittent, large-scale atmospheric pattern that can affect weather worldwide.

In the Pacific Ocean, La Niña increases wind shear, which is a change in wind speed and/or direction with height. Those changes make it more difficult for storms to form. (In the Atlantic, La Niña has the opposite effect, reducing wind shear and increasing the chances for storm formation.)",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,0,-0.723,['Mexico'],['New York']
1168,2020-09-16,Hurricane Sally’s Fierce Rain Shows How Climate Change Raises Storm Risks,"As hurricanes go, Sally was not especially powerful. Rated a Category 2 storm when it struck the Gulf Coast on Wednesday, it was soon downgraded. But climate change likely made it more dangerous by slowing it down and feeding it more moisture, setting it up to pummel the region with wind and catastrophic rainfall.

Sally was crawling at about 3 miles per hour when its eye made landfall early Wednesday near Gulf Shores, Ala., and was “inching its way inland” later in the day, the National Hurricane Center said. The slow movement, or stalling, of the storm led to staggering rain totals, with more than two feet in some areas by midmorning Wednesday and widespread flooding.

“When a storm moves slower, it lingers longer over the same location,” said Kimberly Wood, a geoscientist at Mississippi State University. “A rain rate of, say, an inch an hour — that’s not so bad if the rain only lasts 30 minutes. But if it lasts for half a day, that adds up quickly.”

At least three people died and two were injured this week in accidents related to the power outage. A candle fire burned down a house in San Juan, killing two and injuring one. Another person died and another was sent to the hospital after being intoxicated with fumes from a generator. (On Saturday, the Puerto Rican government said up to 16 people overall may have died as a direct or indirect result of the storm, though at least a dozen of those cases were still being investigated.)

Restoring power after a hurricane can take time anywhere. But Puerto Rico, with its aged and fragile grid, is especially vulnerable to both outages and extensive recovery time. Having lived through months without electricity after Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that ripped through the island five years ago, weary Puerto Ricans — who pay some of the highest electricity rates in the United States — say they have little patience to accept another prolonged blackout after Hurricane Fiona.

“Do you think it’s fair that you pay so much to not have electricity?” said Dennis Rodríguez, 59, one of Ms. Rivera’s neighbors, who said monthly bills have jumped from $80 to more than $200 over the past year. “I can bet you that the power bill will arrive on time.”

She wouldn’t be paid until the end of the month and didn’t have the money to buy last-minute storm supplies, including extra water.

And anyway, she said, she had to keep working — selling insurance over the phone from her house — until the power had cut off. They were almost out of food and had run out of water completely. “We’ve just been driving around to see who can help us,” she said. “And I’m down below half a tank.”

By The New York Times

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce.

Francine is the sixth named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.9794,['United States'],"['New York', 'Leer', 'Nederland', 'Texas']"

By The New York Times

Storms that form in the Atlantic or the Pacific generally move west, meaning Atlantic storms pose a greater threat to North America. If a storm forms in the Pacific close to land, it can bring damaging winds and rain before pushing out to sea.

However, an air mass can sometimes block a storm, driving it north or northeast toward the Baja California peninsula and the west coast of Mexico. Occasionally, a storm can move farther north, as Hurricane Hilary did last year, bringing damaging winds and intense rain to Southern California.

Hurricane season in the Eastern Pacific began on May 15, two weeks before the Atlantic season started. Both seasons run through Nov. 30.

Another factor for storm-watchers this year is the likely development of La Niña, the intermittent, large-scale atmospheric pattern that can affect weather worldwide.

In the Pacific Ocean, La Niña increases wind shear, which is a change in wind speed and/or direction with height. Those changes make it more difficult for storms to form. (In the Atlantic, La Niña has the opposite effect, reducing wind shear and increasing the chances for storm formation.)",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.5984,['Mexico'],['New York']

Typically, storms in the North Central Pacific that have wandered in from near North America keep their original names, as determined by the World Meteorological Association. Storms are given a traditional Hawaiian name when they form in the Central Pacific.

Storms often come close to Hawaii and affect the weather, but a direct landfall of a named storm on a Hawaiian island is rare since the land area is relatively small. Even a brush from one of these storms can cause problems. In 2020, Hurricane Douglas didn’t make a direct hit on the islands, but it produced damaging winds.

Warm water is pushed east during years with El Niño, a large-scale weather pattern in the equatorial Pacific. That brings warmer water closer to Hawaii and provides a breeding ground for storms to form in the Central Pacific.

El Niño also increases the number of named storms in the Eastern Pacific by reducing the amount of wind shear in the region. Wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — tears apart storms and can keep them from intensifying or even developing.

The accumulating wear and tear on the components that hold the grid together, combined with weather that has often been hotter and stormier in some regions, means the wildfires and sustained blackouts may be a preview of how an aging grid could falter spectacularly as weather becomes more extreme and demand for electricity continues to rise.

The National Academy of Engineering calls the power grid the most important innovation of the 20th century, and with the greater electrification of society it will become even more critical. The sprawling system of transmission lines, power plants and transformers connects communities across the United States. Many of the components that tie the system together — utility poles, transmission towers and power lines — haven’t been modernized or upgraded since they were built, often decades ago. The consequences of this neglect, as we have seen, can be catastrophic.

This past spring, a decayed utility pole broke in high winds in the Texas Panhandle, causing power wires to fall on dry grass and igniting the largest fire in the state’s history. Two people died and more than one million acres burned. The Maui wildfire that killed more than 100 people and destroyed the historic town of Lahaina last year began after winds knocked down power lines, also igniting dry grass.

The forecast calls for widespread rainfall of 10 to 20 inches and, in some areas, upward of 25 inches.

The areas most likely to be hit hardest by the rain will be determined by the precise track of the storm’s center, which was still uncertain early Tuesday. Even small changes in the steering currents could result in Debby shifting and changing where the rain falls.

Because of this, an expansive and rare warning of a high risk for excessive rain has been issued in the region for today and tomorrow by the Weather Prediction Center forecasters who specialize in heavy rainfall events. Over the years, when this group has issued this type of high-risk forecast, the storms within the area the forecasters outlined have typically created damaging and often deadly flooding, said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the prediction center.",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,1,0,0,-0.7964,['Georgia'],['Florence']

Satellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.

Storms that form in the Atlantic or the Pacific generally move west, meaning Atlantic storms pose a greater threat to North America. If a storm forms in the Pacific close to land, it can bring damaging winds and rain before pushing out to sea.

However, an air mass can sometimes block a storm, driving it north or northeast toward the Baja California peninsula and the west coast of Mexico. Occasionally, a storm can move farther north, as Hurricane Hilary did last year, bringing damaging winds and intense rain to Southern California.

Hurricane season in the Eastern Pacific began on May 15, two weeks before the Atlantic season started. Both seasons run through Nov. 30.

Another factor for storm-watchers this year is the likely development of La Niña, the intermittent, large-scale atmospheric pattern that can affect weather worldwide.

A major, 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck in the South Pacific Ocean on Monday, according to the United States Geological Survey. The quake prompted a brief “Tsunami Threat” for Tonga.

Preliminary reports from the U.S. Tsunami Warning System said tsunami waves were possible for coastlines within about 190 miles of the earthquake’s epicenter, including those on Tonga. The system issued an all-clear notice about an hour later, after a tsunami would have struck had one materialized.

Tsunamis are a series of long waves caused by a large and sudden displacement of water in the ocean, usually from a large earthquake on or below the ocean floor. Tsunamis radiate in all directions from the epicenter and can cause dangerous coastal flooding and powerful currents that can last for hours or days.

The temblor happened at 1:18 a.m. Tonga time about 49 miles southeast of Pangai, Tonga, data from the U.S.G.S shows.

U.S.G.S. data earlier reported that the magnitude was 7.1.

As seismologists review available data, they may revise the earthquake’s reported magnitude. Additional information collected about the earthquake may also prompt U.S.G.S. scientists to update the shake-severity map.

Aftershocks in the region

An aftershock is usually a smaller earthquake that follows a larger one in the same general area. Aftershocks are typically minor adjustments along the portion of a fault that slipped at the time of the initial earthquake.

Quakes and aftershocks within 100 miles

Aftershocks can occur days, weeks or even years after the first earthquake. These events can be of equal or larger magnitude to the initial earthquake, and they can continue to affect already damaged locations.

It was the deadliest tsunami in recorded history.

No one was immune to the giant wave, which was triggered by a 9.1 magnitude earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Among the dead were fishermen, vacationers, sports stars and a prince.

The brunt of the tsunami was felt in the Indonesian province of Aceh, where 170,000 people perished. Sri Lanka, India and Thailand were devastated, too. More than a thousand miles apart, across the Indian Ocean, hundreds of coastal communities were united in their grief, and in facing years of rebuilding and regrouping.

Some 6,000 aftershocks followed.

The tsunami that rose from this great shifting of tectonic plates reached over 115 feet in some places and ultimately killed about 230,000 people in Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, the Maldives and East Africa. If there had been a natural hazards misery index, it would have registered off the scale.

About one in 28,000 people on Earth perished that day because governments were ill equipped to warn residents and visitors about the coming wave and guide them to safe evacuation routes. India failed to warn people on its eastern coast even after the tsunami wreaked havoc in the Andaman Islands, hours before striking the mainland. In Phuket, Thailand, tourists who were mesmerized by the sudden withdrawal of water roamed the exposed seafloor and then were caught unaware by the rushing water.

1220,2024-12-05,What to Do When There’s a Tsunami Warning,"A tsunami is in the news. Here are answers to some common questions about the phenomenon.

What causes a tsunami?

Most tsunamis are caused by earthquakes. When a tectonic plate shifts abruptly, it can displace a “tremendous amount of water,” causing waves to sweep out in all directions “like a ripple in a pond,” said Dave Snider, a tsunami warning coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Not every earthquake in a coastal area will bring about a tsunami, but these waves can have devastating impacts when they strike nearby shores. In rare cases, tsunamis can travel hundreds of miles across oceans at the speed of a jet, causing destruction far away from their points of origin. Tsunamis can occasionally occur in bodies of water other than the ocean, such as a lake.

A tsunami can be imperceptible to someone aboard a boat in the deep ocean. However, tsunami waves grow taller in shallower waters, making them more dangerous as they approach the shore.

Less frequently, tsunamis can be caused by landslides, volcanic activity or other phenomena that displace enough water to create a disturbance. In rare cases, a type of tsunami known as a meteotsunami can be generated by a change in air pressure associated with a weather system. Several people died when a meteotsunami struck Lake Michigan in 1954.","Most tsunamis are caused by earthquakes. Tsunamis can occasionally occur in bodies of water other than the ocean, such as a lake.

The interaction of the plates causes a large number of earthquakes, according to Lucy Jones, the former head of natural hazards research at the U.S. Geological Survey.

An earthquake with similar force would have been devastating on the faults that run under highly populated areas of California, such as the Hayward fault that runs through Berkeley, Oakland and many other cities just east of San Francisco, Dr. Jones said.

The tectonic rupture that caused Thursday’s earthquake was almost purely horizontal, meaning that two faults had slid past each other. Scientists call this kind of earthquake a “strike slip,” and it is unlikely to cause major tsunamis. That raised questions about why warnings were sent telling residents they were “in danger” and should move to high ground.

1231,2020-05-14,‘It Could Happen Anytime’: Scientists Warn of Alaska Tsunami Threat,"Climate change has increased the risk of a huge landslide in an Alaskan fjord that could cause a catastrophic tsunami, scientists said Thursday.

Warming temperatures have caused the retreat of a glacier that helps support a steep, mile-long slope along one flank of a fjord in Prince William Sound, about 60 miles east of Anchorage. With only a third of the slope now supported by ice, the scientists said, a landslide could be triggered by an earthquake, prolonged heavy rain or even a heat wave that could cause extensive melting of surface snow.

While the slope has been moving for decades, the researchers estimated that a sudden, huge collapse was possible within a year and likely within two decades. “It could happen anytime, but the risk just goes way up as this glacier recedes,” said Anna Liljedahl, an Alaska-based hydrologist with the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts, who was part of the team.

At about three times the size of Rhode Island, Puerto Rico is squeezed between the border of the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates.

The Puerto Rico Trench, north of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, is an undersea fault zone. The North American plate is sliding under the Caribbean plate there, creating the potential for earthquakes and undersea landslides that can set off tsunamis.

“We’re just as likely to have earthquakes as a place like California, Japan, New Zealand, Alaska,” said Elizabeth Vanacore, a seismologist with the Puerto Rico Seismic Network.

1247,2022-04-14,‘It’s Super Spectacular.’ See How the Tonga Volcano Unleashed a Once-in-a-Century Shockwave.,"‘It’s Super Spectacular.’ See How the Tonga Volcano Unleashed a Once-in-a-Century Shockwave. When an underwater volcano in the Pacific island nation of Tonga erupted violently in mid-January, it spawned a tsunami that devastated many of its islands and struck far-off shores across the ocean. But the huge volcanic explosion also generated something that scientists hadn’t seen in more than half a century: a planetary-scale pressure wave, or shockwave, in the atmosphere. The wave circled Earth for days. Scientists will be studying this event for years. Source: Geophysical Research Letters

As shown in this visualization, based on a simulation created by Ángel Amores, a physical oceanographer at the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies in Majorca, Spain, the shockwave took about 36 hours to circumnavigate the globe, spreading out in concentric rings from the volcano known as Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haʻapai and traveling at the speed of sound. The simulation was published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in March.

Dr. Amores was checking data from local weather stations from home when he first saw the signature of the wave. Local instruments showed sudden pressure changes when the shockwave made its first pass over Majorca, about 15 hours after the eruption.

“Then I was waiting and I said, OK, it should take like 36 hours to come back,” he said. “And then it passed again.” After another 36 hours it passed a third time.

“This is the first time that I see something like that,” he said.

“It’s super spectacular,” Peter W. Brown, a physicist at the University of Western Ontario, said of the shockwave, which traveled around the world several times at the speed of sound. “Everybody who studies atmospheric waves are all quite, I would say, awe-struck.”

In Japan, the company Weathernews maintains a network of thousands of low-cost weather sensors that collect data every minute. Many of their sensors detected nearly simultaneous spikes in air pressure as the shockwave passed:

Weather sensors across Japan recorded spikes in air pressure as the shockwave passed. Jan. 15, 8:00 p.m. Each circle represents a weather sensor Air pressure Lower Normal Higher Source: Weathernews Soratena sensor network The visualization shows minute-to-minute changes in air pressure measurements in Japan. For example, the data visualized for 9:01 p.m. shows the change in air pressure between 9 p.m. and 9:01 p.m. Japan time.

Weather stations across the globe detected similar spikes in pressure as the wave passed, including those across the United States, Britain, Germany, India, China and Australia. As it traveled, the shockwave caused small disturbances in local atmospheric properties such as the temperature of water vapor, creating faint ripples that could be seen in satellite images and in video footage at an observatory in Hawaii.

Shockwaves are generated by rapid movement that compresses the surrounding material, which in this case, was air, said Mark Boslough, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.

“You’ve got a compression wave moving into a material, and it’s moving faster than the material can get out of the way,” Dr. Boslough said. “So everything kind of piles up.”

A sonic boom is a familiar type of shockwave, caused by the buildup of pressurized air molecules when an aircraft reaches and then exceeds the speed of sound (about 650 miles an hour at a jet’s cruising altitude).

But a sonic boom is a localized event, experienced briefly on the ground along a path that is at best 50 miles wide. The Tonga explosion was so big its shockwave encompassed the whole planet.

“This was like a giant global sonic boom,” Dr. Boslough said.

The Jan. 15 eruption killed at least three people in Tonga; destroyed or damaged homes, roads and other infrastructure; and damaged crops and reef fisheries. The damage, which the World Bank estimated at $90 million, was caused by volcanic ash and by the tsunami.

As with earthquakes, volcanic eruptions can sometimes generate tsunamis by rapidly displacing a huge amount of seawater. In the Tonga event, the tsunami traveled across the Pacific, generating waves as high as four feet along the North American coast and higher in South America.

Source: Tide data from NOAA’s Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services To account for tides, these charts show the difference between the water level each minute and a 60-minute rolling average. The times shown are in Greenwich Mean Time.

For some Pacific locations, the tsunami arrived during high tide, resulting in the highest water levels since the 1950s, according to Greg Dusek, a physical oceanographer and chief scientist of the NOAA office that monitors ocean tides.

Volcanologists are still studying the eruption, which occurred underwater at a depth of less than 1,000 feet when superhot magma rose up and out of the volcano. By itself that would be a very explosive event as carbon dioxide and other gases within the magma rapidly expanded. But the magma also reacted with seawater, causing it to flash violently into steam.

A plume of hot gases and ash rose more than 20 miles into the atmosphere. At its peak, the plume rose 36 miles, extending beyond the layer of the upper atmosphere known as the stratosphere. According to a NASA report, this was “likely the highest plume in the satellite record.”

The type of shockwave the eruption generated is called a Lamb wave, after Horace Lamb, a British mathematician who first described them in the early 20th century. “It’s really only present when there’s a really big explosion,” Dr. Brown said, one that “can make the entire atmosphere basically vibrate like a bell.”

Dr. Amores and other scientists studying it had never seen one before because the last time there were explosions this big was decades ago, when the United States, the Soviet Union and other countries tested nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. Aboveground tests were largely banned in the early 1960s, although a few small ones were conducted until 1980.

Dr. Brown said the Lamb wave generated by the eruption was similar in scale to one from the largest atmospheric test ever conducted, of a Soviet weapon known as “Tsar Bomba.” It was detonated over the Soviet Arctic in 1961 and released energy equivalent to about 50 million tons, or 50 megatons, of TNT.

The Tonga explosion certainly released more than that amount of energy, Dr. Brown said. “We can say that comfortably.”

The changes in atmospheric pressure observed as the wave traveled around Earth were relatively small, a deviation of well under 1 percent from standard pressure. But the changes persisted for tens of minutes, Dr. Brown said.

That resulted in another kind of tsunami, called a meteotsunami, in places far removed from the volcano. Meteotsunamis are most commonly caused by fast-moving weather systems, when under the right conditions the change in air pressure above a lake or other body of water can cause potentially damaging waves to develop.

After the eruption, meteotsunamis were seen in Japan, arriving hours before the “classic” tsunami waves caused by seawater displacement reached the country. That’s because the pressure wave in the atmosphere traveled faster than the tsunami in the Pacific.

Meteotsunamis were also observed much farther from the Pacific, in the Caribbean and even in the Mediterranean.

Source: Tide and air pressure data from NOAA’s Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services The air pressure chart shows the change in air pressure over six-minute intervals, and the water level chart shows the difference in water level from a 60-minute rolling average, to account for tides. The times shown are in Greenwich Mean Time.

When Dr. Dusek’s colleagues at NOAA detected the signature of a tsunami in the Caribbean, they were initially surprised. “We were like, well, that doesn't seem likely,” he said. “And what we noticed is that it was immediately following the arrival of this pressure wave or shockwave.”

Dr. Dusek said this was probably the first time since the huge 1883 eruption of Krakatau that a volcanic eruption created a global shockwave, which in turn generated ocean waves in harbors worldwide.

The Krakatau shockwave, which shattered the eardrums of sailors on a ship 40 miles away, was recorded by barometers around the world and circled the globe at least three times. “This is the first time, though, that we've seen it happen in real time,” Dr. Dusek said.

The shockwave eventually degraded, Dr. Boslough said, as all waves do. “As you knock molecules together from the compression wave, a little energy gets sucked out by heating up the air,” he said. “So eventually they just die out, just like sound waves don’t travel forever.”

Dr. Boslough’s primary focus at Los Alamos is on protecting the planet from collisions with objects from space, studying the potential effects of, say, an asteroid explosion in the atmosphere.

The Tonga explosion “is highly related,” he said. “The phenomena are very similar.”

Dr. Boslough is also developing a simulation of the explosion. “This is really an opportunity,” he said. “One of the reasons we are working on this is its relationship to planetary defense, and understanding what a big shockwave in the atmosphere can do to the Earth.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,1,0,1,-0.9893,"['Germany', 'Japan', 'Tonga', 'Mexico', 'Spain', 'Australia', 'United States', 'India', 'China']",[]

1251,2023-08-24,Japan Begins Releasing Treated Radioactive Water at Fukushima,"Why It Matters

In the two years since Japan announced its plan to release the wastewater into the sea, the plan has provoked serious political tensions with nearby China and South Korea, as well as anxiety at home. The Chinese government had previously criticized the plan as unsafe; in South Korea, the administration of President Yoon Suk Yeol supports Japan’s efforts, but opposition lawmakers have castigated the move as a potential threat to humans. Within Japan, fishermen’s unions fear that public anxiety about the safety of the water could affect their livelihoods.

Background

Ever since a huge earthquake and tsunami in 2011 led to a meltdown at the Fukushima plant, Tepco, as the power company is known, has used water to cool the ruined nuclear fuel rods that remain too hot to remove. As the water passes through the reactors, it picks up nuclear materials. The power company runs the cooling water through treatment plants that remove most radioactive nuclides except for tritium, which the International Atomic Energy Agency said in July will not pose a serious health threat to humans if released to the ocean.

The Japanese government has said that with more than 1.34 million tons of wastewater already accumulated on site, the power company will shortly run out of storage room and that it has no choice but to release the water into the ocean.

What’s Next

The first release of 7,800 tons of treated water is expected to last about 17 days. Both Tepco and Japan’s fisheries agency have said they will monitor the ocean water for radioactive levels, and the IAEA has said it will also oversee the process, which is expected to last decades.

To compensate fishermen who lose business due to public anxiety, the Japanese government is allocating 80 billion yen ($552 million).

1261,2024-09-18,Plastic Waste and Toxic Sludge: A Sweep of a Messy Beat,"Your new beat is pollution. Why focus on that?

Climate is very politicized. In a lot of red states, climate change can be a tricky subject. But a lot of red-state voters still care about clean water and air. Also, I sometimes struggle to get readers to my stories; if we say something like, “Our average temperatures will rise by this much in 100 years,” it’s hard to wrap your head around that. But pollution — such as chemicals turning up in our drinking water — feels much more immediate.

What are your greatest reporting challenges?

I do find the climate and environmental beat to be very challenging. You have to dig through a lot of science. I don’t want to say that business reporting was easier, but if retail sales were down, I could write a story about how analysts thought bad weather was a factor. Nobody can necessarily prove them right or wrong. But with climate science you have to be careful, or you can get things completely wrong.

There’s also a lot of policy, which is very dense. I struggle to wrap my mind around that. You have to be accurate, find the issues and write about them in a compelling way. Getting those elements into one story can be very challenging.

What’s the best part of your job?

My favorite moments as a journalist are when I’m talking to people, like a family in the Navajo Nation or a cattle farmer in Texas. I feel very thrilled when I meet someone I would have never crossed paths with if I weren’t a journalist.

You write about a lot of heavy subjects. How do you decompress?

I’m terrible at that. It helps that my husband is not a journalist. If I come home and say, “Oh my God, this terrible thing happened,” he will say, “That sounds really bad, but what should we have for dinner?” He’s only interested up until a certain point, which is nice.

1264,2023-08-22,"Just Like That, Tons of Radioactive Waste Is Heading for the Ocean","But perhaps even more worrying, Japan is setting a precedent for other governments that might be even less transparent. This is dangerous, particularly in Asia, where more than 140 nuclear power reactors are already in operation and, led by growth in China and India, dozens more are either being built, are in the planning stages or have been proposed. If Japan, a globally respected cultural and economic force, can get away with dumping radioactive water, what’s to stop other countries?

There’s no denying that Japan and Tepco are in a bind over what to do with the byproducts of the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. Melted nuclear fuel debris inside the damaged reactors is being cooled by pumped-in water, which comes into contact with a toxic cocktail of radioactive substances known as radionuclides. To this is added approximately 100 tons of groundwater and rainwater, which leak into the reactor buildings each day and also become contaminated. All of the water is sent through a powerful filtration system to remove much of the radioactivity and is stored on-site in more than 1,000 giant steel tanks. But the amount of water is constantly growing, and Tepco has repeatedly warned that it is running out of storage space at Fukushima.

I have researched or written about Fukushima and affected communities ever since the disaster and have closely followed the official response. As early as 2013, the I.A.E.A. began advising Tepco to consider discharging the water into the sea. The government also looked at other options, such as releasing the water into the air as vapor or injecting it deep underground. But numerous experts and environmental groups have complained that there has been a consistent lack of sufficient public input and that some viable alternatives, such as long-term storage in more robust tanks, were not seriously evaluated. Despite opposition from many Japanese citizens, the country’s fisheries association, and neighbors like South Korea and China, the government announced in April 2021 that it had decided on releasing the water into the ocean.

Public hearings, some of which I attended, were held before and after the final decision, but these seemed more about selling the ocean release option than about giving the public a say. It was only months after the decision was announced that a radiological environmental impact assessment — conducted by Tepco — was finally released. When Tepco called for public comments for the study, some experts pointed out troubling information gaps, such as the lack of a full inventory of what radioactive elements remained in the tanks. There is no evidence that serious efforts were made to address some of these issues.

Involving local residents, civil society groups, technical experts and — when necessary — neighboring nations in decision-making can lead to notable successes. In choosing the site of a long-term repository for low-level radioactive waste, Belgian regulators in 1998 gave decision-making power to a broad cross section of public and private stakeholders. In the end, two neighboring towns actually competed to be the site, and in 2006 a proposal by the municipality of Dessel was approved. After years of study and environmental approvals, a final permit was issued this year.

The extra warming would likely continue for longer than the cooling after Pinatubo, he added.

Susan Solomon, an atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who described the temperature impacts of changes in stratospheric water vapor in a 2010 study, said the Tonga eruption “could add something on the order of 0.05 degrees of warming to global average temperatures,” probably for three to five years.

“That’s less than what we expect from carbon dioxide, which is closer to 0.1 to 0.2 degrees per decade,” she said. Dr. Solomon was not involved in the Tonga research.

All that water vapor will very likely also alter the atmospheric chemistry that destroys ozone, the oxygen molecule that protects life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.

For the last decade, that’s where the water has stayed. But with more than 1.3 million tons in the tanks, Japan is running out of room. So next year in spring, it plans to begin releasing the water into the Pacific after treatment for most radioactive particles, as has been done elsewhere.

Eruptions emit sulfur dioxide gas, and if enough of it is shot high enough into the atmosphere, it can have a cooling effect on the Earth.

But eruptions that are big enough to do that are rare. The last one was at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, which pumped about 20 million tons of the gas into the air when it erupted in 1991. That led to global cooling of about 1 degree Fahrenheit, or half a degree Celsius, for nearly two years.

If the eruption of the Hunga volcano was anything like Pinatubo, climate scientists would have a lot to study about natural influences on climate. NASA has even developed a rapid-response program to quickly deploy balloon-laden instruments to gather data after such a large eruption.

From satellite pictures of the Hunga eruption, it seemed like it might be another Pinatubo-like event. But looks turned out to be deceiving.

1282,2023-02-06,"Hours after the first quake, the region was hit by an unusually large aftershock.","Like all large earthquakes, the powerful 7.8 magnitude temblor that struck Turkey and Syria on Monday was followed by dozens of aftershocks, secondary quakes that occur when the movement of the first causes changes in stresses underground.

One of those aftershocks, which struck about nine hours after the initial quake, was nearly as strong as the first and measured at magnitude 7.5. Powerful aftershocks like that can add to the destruction, shaking buildings and infrastructure that have already been badly weakened by the initial quake.

The 7.5 aftershock was well above average, and was about one-third as powerful as the 7.8 quake. From statistical analyses of quakes worldwide, the most powerful aftershock Monday would have been expected to be about magnitude 6.8, or only about one-thirtieth as powerful as the first quake.

“There’s nothing magic about aftershock magnitude,” said Susan Hough, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey. Sometimes an aftershock is even larger than the initial quake, Dr. Hough said, in which case the aftershock is considered the main quake and the first one is referred to as a foreshock.

Aftershocks can occur on the same fault as the main earthquake, or on nearby faults that are affected by the stress changes. This aftershock was centered about 60 miles north of the initial quake.

Aftershocks also can continue to occur for weeks or months following a strong quake, with their frequency and strength gradually declining.

The earthquakes on Monday occurred on the East Anatolian Fault Zone, part of a complex system of faults in Turkey that make the region one of the most seismically active in the world. Another fault zone, the North Anatolian, has caused many large earthquakes, including a 1999 quake centered about 60 miles from Istanbul that killed more than 15,000 people.

All of these are strike-slip faults, meaning the blocks of crust move horizontally relative to one another when strains between them reach a breaking point. Dr. Hough said that given the magnitude of the first quake on Monday, it’s likely that the movement occurred along 120 miles or so of the fault.

After the initial break, near Gaziantep in south central Turkey, the rupture would have propagated along the fault at about 2 miles a second, Dr. Hough said. This would help account for the lengthy shaking, which some witnesses said lasted for 90 seconds or longer.

Large strike-slip fault zones on land are not common , Dr. Hough said; the San Andreas Fault in California is another example. But those on land can be extremely destructive, because they tend to be close to population centers, and they can be fairly shallow, increasing the shaking felt at the surface.

Some quakes are centered more than a hundred miles below the surface, but the initial shock on Monday occurred at a depth of about 11 miles.

In some cases the destruction from strike-slip earthquakes is more widespread than from larger quakes that occur in so-called subduction zones, where one large crustal plate is sliding beneath another. Subduction zones, like those that exist around the rim of the Pacific Ocean, are usually offshore and tremors occur at greater depth. Most of the destruction in those cases often comes from a tsunami, as occurred in the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan.",,5,Earthquake_Tsunami_MajorEvents,scientific report,1,0,1,-0.9787,"['United States', 'Türkiye', 'Japan', 'Syrian Arab Republic']",['Gaziantep']

Surveys that track audience interest suggested that “The Way of Water” could arrive to as much as $175 million in opening-weekend ticket sales in the United States and Canada.

It was not to be.

The ultraexpensive event movie collected about $134 million at North American theaters over its first three days, according to Comscore, which compiles ticketing data. Directed by James Cameron and revisiting the fantasy world of Pandora, “The Way of Water” cost Disney an estimated $600 million to make and market. Three more sequels are planned.

But there may still be a way for “The Way of Water” to become a big, blue juggernaut — possibly even surpassing the $2 billion in global sales that Cameron publicly set as the benchmark for financial success, given the film’s stratospheric production and marketing costs. Consider what happened with the first “Avatar” in 2009. It arrived to a soft $77 million and went on to gross $2.9 billion worldwide.

The announcement came after the countries reached an agreement to expand monitoring of the treated water, which Japan began discharging in August of last year. The Japanese government and Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operated the Fukushima plant and is overseeing its cleanup, have assured the public that the water is safe for human consumption.

China was the most outspoken of several Asia-Pacific countries that objected to the release of the water, citing fears that it could contaminate seafood, though most scientists have dismissed such concerns. The water had been used to cool the nuclear fuel rods destroyed in 2011 when the Fukushima plant, on Japan’s east coast, melted down after a devastating earthquake and tsunami.

This is what happened at the Fukushima reactors in Japan in 2011, when an earthquake and tsunami wiped out backup power systems.

But Chernobyl carries some other risks related to the large amount of nuclear waste on site.

The fuel inside a reactor eventually becomes used up and is replaced. As is common practice in the nuclear power industry, the fuel removed from all four Chernobyl reactors over the years, more than 20,000 assemblies in all, is stored in pools of water that dissipate the heat produced as the fuel decays radioactively. When fuel is newly removed from a reactor and is still highly radioactive, there is a lot of decay and thus a lot of heat, so plants need power to run pumps that circulate the storage water, removing excess heat in the process.

If the water in storage tanks got so hot it boiled off, the fuel would be exposed to the air and could catch fire. That, too, was among the risks in the Fukushima disaster.

The I.A.E.A. has said that the used fuel assemblies at Chernobyl are old enough and have decayed enough that circulating pumps are not needed to keep them safe.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,-0.9804,['Japan'],[]

The West Coast is being battered by those three awful cousins, drought, heat and wildfire. When will the hot weather leave certain unforgettable, vertical hikes, like to the top of Half Dome, out of reach?

Yosemite’s last two glaciers are rapidly retreating. They will most likely disappear in a few decades, threatening the summer and autumn water supply in these mountains. By the time I visited in the first week of July, some of the streams in the high country — relied upon by animals and backpackers alike — were already dry. The river that threads through the valley, the Merced, was low and listless. When I lived alongside it years ago, it was so swollen with melted snow and the rapids so loud, I would have to close my window before making a phone call.

The evidence of our planet’s warming is all around us. But many of us have been able to comfort ourselves, if only slightly, with the knowledge that the more cataclysmic fallout is still a ways off, that it may be preventable. Perhaps the gradual nature of the worsening conditions we see every day has lulled us into a sense of complacency.

These cuts threaten your budget, too. Insurance companies rely heavily on data gathered by NOAA and the U.S. Geological Survey to assess wildfire, flood, wind and other risks. Some firms are warning that any interruption in data availability could drive insurance premiums for customers even higher. Other layoffs at the U.S.G.S. could undermine programs that monitor drought and flood conditions, hazardous spills and sewage overflows and the health of salmon fisheries off the Pacific Coast.

And then there’s air pollution. On March 4, the State Department announced that it would no longer share data gathered by air quality monitors at more than 80 U.S. embassies and consulates around the world. With that decision, another one of the government’s most effective global monitoring efforts went dark.

Since the first air quality monitoring system was installed atop the U.S. Embassy in Beijing in 2008, the initiative has yielded a huge return on a modest investment by simply telling people what they’re breathing. During a particularly severe air pollution episode in November 2010, the Beijing monitor tweeted an automated message that air quality in the city had reached “crazy bad” levels. The programmers had written that message in jest, assuming that it would never be triggered because pollution levels would never get that bad. The tweet prompted news stories around the world, and the intense scrutiny helped compel China’s leaders to act. Fifteen years later, China’s air is much cleaner.

From Lagos to Karachi, U.S. Embassy monitors were among the only reliable sources of information about what residents were inhaling every day. One 2022 study found that the air quality readings triggered local policies that substantially reduced particulate matter concentrations, leading to reductions in premature deaths and saving an average of $127 million per city each year. The State Department cited “budget constraints” as the reason for shuttering the program. But the researchers found that the program saved the State Department money — it more than covered its costs by reducing compensation for embassy workers’ pollution exposure.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,news analysis,2,0,0,-0.797,"['United States', 'China']","['Beijing', 'Karachi', 'Albany']"
1301,2023-09-10,Monday Briefing: Searching Morocco’s Quake Zone,"A race to reach survivors of the Morocco quake

Rescuers in Morocco struggled to reach remote areas in the mountains outside Marrakesh yesterday after the worst earthquake to hit the area in a century flattened homes across central and southern parts of the country on Friday. At least 2,122 people were killed and more than 2,421 were injured in the disaster, Moroccan state television reported.

The extent of the damage and the number of casualties from the magnitude-6.8 earthquake were unclear because the hardest-hit communities were in the High Atlas Mountains, where debris blocked access to the few roads, and where phone service and electricity were knocked out. The U.S. Geological Survey said that a 3.9-magnitude earthquake, almost certainly an aftershock, struck the area just before 9 a.m. yesterday.

In Marrakesh, residents tried to locate survivors under piles of rubble from the buildings that had crumbled around them. In the rural areas outside the city, people climbed through the canyons formed by collapsed homes to retrieve bodies. And in some remote areas, residents sifted through mountains of debris with their bare hands in search of survivors. People in isolated villages and the city set up camps outside, either because their homes were uninhabitable or because they feared aftershocks.

The next few days will be critical: After four or five days, the possibility of survival dwindles. Damaged buildings present an “extremely dangerous environment” for those trying to help, said Caroline Holt, a senior official at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.",,5,Earthquake_Tsunami_MajorEvents,natural disaster,2,0,1,-0.9879,"['United States', 'Morocco']",['Marrakesh']
1302,2021-08-30,The Point Is That People in the South Are Suffering,"This is the flip side of that confounding Southern insistence on “freedom” that you keep hearing about. It’s the thing that rural people do best: They tend to their own. If they have two of something, they give one to somebody else. If they have one of something, they break it into two and give half away.

And that’s why the hatred that inevitably erupts on social media, or in the comment sections of news reports, is so galling. It’s a constant refrain whenever something terrible happens in the South: a clamor of voices telling us we deserve to suffer because we don’t believe in climate change, because we are too stupid to vote for leaders who do. Such vitriol is never directed at the victims of climate disasters in other regions of the country.

The point is that people are suffering. And if their leaders and pundits insist that climate change is a hoax? If their own lives have never given them any reason to question that pronouncement? If even now they are skeptical of outsiders coming in to tell them that this kind of tragedy will keep happening, and happen more often? The answer is not to tell them that they deserve the terrible things that happened to them.

Instead of engaging in what a progressive, small-town friend of mine calls “misplaced schadenfreude,” we need to learn to talk about climate change in a new way, one that isn’t so politically charged. And we can start, as climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe notes, by making it personal.

That means starting with shared values. “The most important thing to do,” Dr. Hayhoe says in her TED Talk, is “to start from the heart.” We can’t start with data, she says, and we sure can’t start with accusations. We can start with what we share: “Are we both parents? Do we live in the same community? Do we enjoy the same outdoor activities: hiking, biking, fishing, even hunting? Do we care about the economy or national security?”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,-0.9305,['United States'],[]
1303,2023-03-31,"When Every Win Means Water, Water Everywhere","When Every Win Means Water Everywhere

Picture yourself at work. You’re chatting by the water cooler. A colleague swings by to say she got that big promotion she’d been after. You and your co-workers are so happy for her that you all take your cups of water and dump them on her head.

In most workplaces, this would rightfully be categorized as deranged behavior. Teleport this scene into a sports locker room, though, and suddenly the dousing is perfectly in bounds.

Dropped 50 points at Madison Square Garden? Enjoy a few gallons of water in your face. Just crushed a walk-off home run? Get your umbrella out. Reached a major statistical milestone? Welcome to Splash Mountain.

Athletes love pouring things on each others’ heads. Major League Baseball teams started spraying champagne to celebrate championships sometime around the 1960s. N.F.L. players have been unloading Gatorade coolers on unsuspecting coaches at the Super Bowl since the mid-80s.

But water in recent years has become the go-to beverage for athletes seeking a quick and relatively hygienic way to commemorate achievements large and small. And few segments of the sports calendar are as waterlogged as March Madness, when men’s and women’s college basketball teams navigate six rounds of anxiety-ridden, must-win contests in constant search of catharsis.

“In the moment you’re all excited but don’t really know what to do, so it’s like, let’s just throw water around,” said Jack Nunge, a center for Xavier, whose locker room briefly resembled the inside of a carwash after the team’s second-round win over Pittsburgh. “We’re not trying to ruin anyone’s clothing or anything.”

Brock Cunningham, a Texas forward, on two separate occasions emptied a 10-gallon cooler on Coach Rodney Terry and his teammates during the Longhorns’ soggy run to the regional finals.

“We celebrated in the puddle,” Cunningham said.

Moments after securing a spot in the round of 16, the Villanova women’s players, armed with squeeze bottles, arranged themselves into an impromptu firing line and shot streams of cold water on Coach Denise Dillon as she dashed into the locker room.

“I’ll take the shower anytime,” said Dillon, who sat for a postgame news conference with her hair still soaked.

Splashing a bit of water around in a moment of ecstasy is not entirely new, but postgame celebrations of this sort have become more prominent and essentially routine over the past decade. Teams now regularly post videos of them to social media as part of their marketing efforts.

Grant Hill, a former college and N.B.A. star, said he believed the omnipresence of cellphone and television cameras — and the increasing willingness of players to accept them into locker rooms — had increased these celebrations in recent years.

Hill, 50, an analyst for the tournament, visibly shuddered when asked if he and his Duke teammates in the early 1990s had ever doused Mike Krzyzewski, the team’s famously stoic coach, in similar fashion.

“We never poured water — especially on Coach K — I mean, that wasn’t even thought of,” said Hill, who sensed that the bar for this kind of revelry seemed to be lowering. “Nowadays they celebrate everything.”

And athletes, therefore, are acting more amphibious.

The Sacramento Kings last month danced inside a man-made tsunami after a double-overtime victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. The golfer Lydia Ko was soaked by her fellow competitors after her first ever professional win — and, in keeping with a modern L.P.G.A. tradition, has been drenched many times since. The Auburn football team two years ago transformed its locker room into the Wildwater Kingdom after each of its regular season wins, with the entire squad simultaneously squirting water into the air.

Not everyone has been happy about the rise of postgame spritzing.

When Texas guard Sir’Jabari Rice sees his teammates holding bottles after a game, he waits patiently in the hallway for the deluge to end. If he has a big night or hits a game-winning shot, he will find some way to keep his distance, in case anybody is planning to hurl water his way.

“Honestly, man, I’m not going to lie to you, man, I’m different,” Rice said. “I don’t like oceans. I don’t like swimming pools. I’m scared of sharks and water. I don’t really like water in the first place, in any shape or form. When I was little, and everybody’s going to a water park? I’m not there. I’ll dip my feet in some water. But my whole body getting wet? Nah.”

Unfortunately for Rice, bottled water has seeped into just about every corner of American life, surpassing soda as the most consumed packaged drink by volume in 2016. Americans consumed 4.6 billion gallons of bottled water in 2000, according to Beverage Marketing Corporation. Last year, that number had almost quadrupled, to 16 billion gallons.

Teams always have a lot of water around. And in the heat of competition, a cool splash is not necessarily unwelcome. Games, crucially, also tend to happen in the proximity of hot showers and dry clothes.

Many college students, anyway, don’t have many other options, legally. The Kansas men’s team, for instance, celebrated its national title last year with a water bottle waterfall over Coach Bill Self’s head — a teetotal rendition of the champagne squalls typically seen from championship-winning pro teams.

“We can’t do none of that,” Terrance Arceneaux, a freshman guard for Houston, said about those boozy blowouts. “Hopefully when we get to the league we can.”

Celebratory water fights have reached lower levels of sports, too. In 2020, the girls’ basketball players at NorthWood High School in Nappanee, Ind., doused their coach, Adam Yoder, after each of their five postseason victories.

“There’s a lot of pressure on athletes to perform, and when you prove to yourself that you can accomplish something, it’s a genuine way of showing happiness,” said Norm Sellers, NorthWood’s athletic director at the time, who left cases of bottled water in the locker room as motivation.

Yoder was caught off guard at first. But like many coaches, he eventually accepted his fate, removing his shoes before entering the locker room.

Some coaches, though, find ways to turn the tables.

A few years ago, John Beilein, the former Michigan men’s basketball coach, wielded a Super Soaker water gun in self-defense after a big win in the 2017 N.C.A.A. tournament.

Abe Eagle, a forward for Gonzaga, revealed that the team’s coaching staff this month engineered its own “sneak attack” after the team slipped by Texas Christian in the second round. The athletes were unwinding in the locker room when Coach Mark Few and his assistants charged in and began sousing them with ice-cold water.

“We figured out how to load up early and attack earlier,” Few said, “or else we just get pummeled.”

With wetness all around, at least one team this March has intentionally kept its postgame celebrations bone-dry.

The Miami men, which advanced to the Final Four, said aquatic celebrations, for them, felt premature. They splashed bottles several times last year during a surprise run to the regional finals, but the experience left them wanting more. Isaiah Wong, the team’s star shooting guard, said they would only consider spraying water now if they won the championship.

1304,2021-10-07,6 Aspects of American Life Threatened by Climate Change,"The federal government has attempted this exercise before, during the Obama administration. That work effectively stopped under former President Donald J. Trump, whose disdain for climate science led most agencies to either shelve their planning for climate change or stop talking about it.

Within weeks of taking office, President Biden directed officials to quickly resume the work. Stressing the urgency of the threat, the president gave agencies four months to come up with plans that listed their main vulnerabilities to climate change and strategies to address them.

“Nearly every service that the government provides will be impacted by climate change sooner or later,” said Jesse Keenan, a professor at Tulane University who focuses on climate adaptation and has advised federal agencies.

The plans released Thursday are brief, many of them fewer than 30 pages. They include core themes: ensuring that new facilities meet tougher construction standards, using less energy and water at existing buildings, better protecting workers against extreme heat, educating staff about climate science, and creating supply chains that are less likely to be disrupted by storms or other shocks.

The documents also reflect Mr. Biden’s emphasis on racial equity, looking at the effects of climate change on minority and low-income communities and how agencies can address them.

1305,2021-09-16,"Nicholas, Big and Slow","Since the storm named Nicholas made landfall in Texas on Tuesday, it hasn’t traveled very far.

It first lingered over southeastern Texas, dumping rain along the coast and causing power outages in Houston. Since then, the storm has moved east over Louisiana, sometimes as slow as two miles an hour. Nicholas could cause flooding in Mississippi, Alabama and Florida today and tomorrow.

This kind of storm — big and slow, bringing enormous amounts of rain — is an increasingly common part of life under climate change.

There are two main reasons. One is that hotter air can hold more moisture than cooler air. (For the same reason, your skin stays moister in the summer than in the winter.) Gabriel Vecchi, a Princeton University scientist, compares warmer air to a bigger bucket: It can carry more water from oceans and then dump that water on land.

The second reason is that climate change seems to have caused a slowdown in the speed of storms, allowing them to spend more time in one place.

1306,2023-08-17,Fire Exposes Flaws in Hawaii’s Defenses Against Climate Shocks,"Part of the problem is the sheer diversity of threats. “Hawaii is a leader among states in its approach to adaptation planning, particularly as it relates to sea level rise, extreme storms and infrastructure,” said Mark Rupp, adaptation program director for the Georgetown Climate Center in Washington. “The challenge that Hawaii and all states are facing is the ways in which climate change is upending the assumptions that underlie the best thought-out plans.”

The state lacks building standards that would better protect structures against wildfires, for example, by requiring the use of fire-resistant materials and construction techniques, or by maintaining space around structures that are clear of flammable vegetation.

That puts Hawaii out of step with much of the country: 21 states, including California and most other Western states, have adopted those standards, according to the International Code Council, the Washington-based nonprofit group that compiles them.

Last month, Gov. Josh Green of Hawaii issued an order that stops the state from adopting new or updated building standards. The governor said the move was necessary to address a severe housing shortage.

Attempts to block tougher building codes in the name of affordability are common nationwide, even if it sacrifices safety, said Michele Steinberg, wildfire division director for the National Fire Protection Association.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,0.2732,[],['Washington']

Many residents had been at home, getting ready for work and school, when the quake struck. Others were driving on highways or had already set off on early hikes in Taiwan’s national parks ahead of a four-day holiday. After the main quake stopped, people across the island fled on to the streets to assess damaged buildings and quickly text friends and family members reassurances and pictures of broken belongings.

1308,2021-11-29,Europe Revisits Nuclear Power as Climate Deadlines Loom,"PARIS — European countries desperate for a long-term and reliable source of energy to help reach ambitious climate goals are turning to an answer that caused earlier generations to shudder: nuclear power.

Poland wants a fleet of smaller nuclear power stations to help end its reliance on coal. Britain is betting on Rolls-Royce to produce cheap modular reactors to complement wind and solar energy. And in France, President Emmanuel Macron plans to build on the nation’s huge nuclear program.

As world leaders pledge to avert a climate catastrophe, the nuclear industry sees an opportunity for a revival. Sidelined for years after the disasters at Fukushima and Chernobyl, advocates are wrangling to win recognition of nuclear energy, alongside solar and wind, as an acceptable source of clean power.

More than half a dozen European countries recently announced plans to build a new generation of nuclear reactors. Some are smaller and cheaper than older designs, occupying the space of two football fields and costing a fraction of the price of standard nuclear plants.

1309,2022-08-26,Bills in Britain Will Soar 80% as Energy Crisis Crashes Into Europe,"For months, a tsunami of high energy costs has borne down on Europe. On Friday, the first big waves crashed ashore in Britain, with the news that household gas and electricity bills will nearly double in October.

The announcement, by Britain’s energy regulator, raised the specter of a humanitarian crisis in one of the world’s richest countries: Millions of Britons might not be able to afford to heat or light their homes this winter, unless the government steps in on an enormous scale to cushion them from the vagaries of the market.

It also rattled British politics in the final days of a hard-fought campaign to replace Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The country seems strikingly unprepared for a crisis foretold ever since Russia jolted global energy markets by cutting back the flow of natural gas to Germany and other European countries.

In a country where rising prices have become numbingly familiar at gasoline stations and grocery stores, the sheer magnitude of the increase left many slack-jawed: A typical British household would pay 3,549 pounds (about $4,200) over a year for electricity and natural gas, up from the current £1,971.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,news analysis,0,0,0,0.3818,"['Germany', 'Russian Federation']",[]
1310,2022-09-16,Nuclear Power Still Doesn’t Make Much Sense,"But the argument for significantly ramping up the production of nuclear power — especially in places where overall energy consumption isn’t growing, like in the United States and Europe — falls short. That’s because the nuclear industry has long been hobbled by two problems that its boosters can’t really wish away: Nuclear is far slower to build than most other forms of power, and it’s far more expensive, too. And now there is a third problem on the horizon. As battery technology improves and the price of electricity storage plummets, nuclear may be way too late, too — with much of its value eclipsed by cheaper, faster and more flexible renewable power technologies.

In order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels — the goal set in the Paris Agreement to avert the worst effects of global warming — experts say that we need to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions to a net of zero by 2050. Responding to such a climate emergency with nuclear power is like calling on a sloth to put out a house fire. The 63 nuclear reactors that went into service around the world between 2011 and 2020 took an average of around 10 years to build. By comparison, solar and wind farms can be built in months; in 2020 and 2021 alone, the world added 464 gigawatts of wind and solar power-generation capacity, which is more power than can be generated by all the nuclear plants operating in the world today.

The nuclear industry has been notorious for cost overruns and delays. The only nuclear reactors under construction in the United States — a Westinghouse project at the Plant Vogtle power station in Georgia — were started in 2013 and projected to be finished in 2017. They are still not done — and an initial budget of $14 billion has more than doubled to over $28 billion. In 2017, utilities in South Carolina canceled two reactors midway through construction after cost projections ballooned from $11.5 billion to more than $25 billion.

And after all this build time, you get a very expensive source of energy. In a common energy industry measure known as “levelized cost,” nuclear’s minimum price is about $131 per megawatt-hour, which is at least twice the price of natural gas and coal, and four times the cost of utility-scale solar and onshore wind power installations. And the high price of nuclear power doesn’t include its extraneous costs, such as the staggering price of disasters. Cleanup and other costs for the 2011 Fukushima disaster, caused by an earthquake and a tsunami off the Japanese coast, may approach a trillion dollars.

Nuclear boosters say that these problems can be solved. There was much talk at the conference about streamlining regulations and reducing costs and build times by constructing smaller, more advanced and less disaster-prone reactors. Once we start building more, the industry will start seeing the benefits of scale and efficiency, several industry insiders told me.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.9015,"['United States', 'Georgia']",[]
1311,2020-07-22,Learning From the Kariba Dam,"Listen to This Article

To hear more audio stories from publishers like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android.

The Kariba Dam is failing. Since the late 1950s, it has sat on the Zambezi River, on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, in one of the zigzagging gorges that ripple the land there. It provides 1,830 megawatts of hydroelectric power to both countries and holds back the world’s largest reservoir. For the last decade, scientists and reporters have issued warnings about the dam’s potential to cause ecological disasters — of opposite kinds. On one hand, low rainfall has yielded water levels that barely reach the minimum necessary to generate electricity. On the other hand, heavy rainfall has threatened to flood the surrounding areas. When the floodgates were opened in 2010, 6,000 people had to be evacuated.

Climate change catastrophizes the weather — and when it comes to such extremes, dams are, well, inflexible. They cannot be narrowed enough to eke more force from less water during droughts, and far worse, they cannot be expanded enough to accommodate floods. The only other ways to handle floods are to let the water flow over the top of the dam or to open up a spillway for controlled release. Neither of these measures is foolproof at the Kariba Dam because of how the passage of time has worn it down. The dam was built on gneiss and quartzite and is made of concrete — 80 feet at its thickest point. But over six decades of the waters’ rushing through it, tumbling over it and crashing down on its other side have carved a pit at its base and erosion threatens its foundations. Its plunge pool is now a 266-foot-deep crater.

As the stony facade continues to crumble, the likelihood rises that the Kariba Dam will not just fail but fall. If the dam collapses, the BBC reported in 2014, a tsunami would tear through the Zambezi River Valley, a torrent so powerful that it would knock down another dam a hundred miles away, the Cahora Bassa in Mozambique — twin disasters that would take out 40 percent of the hydroelectric capacity in all of southern Africa. At the same time, longer hot seasons have drained the reservoir to record lows, and drought-induced power cuts have become a daily reality for homes and businesses. The World Bank is supporting efforts to secure the Kariba Dam, but any attempts to fix or expand it risk weakening it further, which would be disastrous in the event of a flood.

Whether the water is too high or too low, the lives of millions of people are at stake, to say nothing of the natural ecosystem. It’s a familiar, seemingly inevitable tale of human folly: One of our most ambitious efforts to harness the power of nature has left us exposed to nature’s vagaries.

Is this just a failure of our power of prophecy? When we talk about climate change, we talk about our inability to predict and control what’s coming, to step into the same river twice. We’re out of time, in more than one sense: We’ve fallen out of rhythm with the circulatory relations between sun and rain and earth. We’ve damned ourselves, foreclosed some of the future’s forking paths — this is the aspect of time we call the subjunctive, the grammatical mood for what is imagined or wished. A river’s branches suggest to us what could, would, should be. But the subjunctive mood — when it comes to rivers, when it comes to time — doesn’t move in only one direction. If we look back, it’s clear: It didn’t have to be this way.

The history of the Kariba Dam is the story of a war over the past and the future of a river. That war was fought in the 1950s between European colonial powers and the local people in a place then called the Central African Federation or the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The federation was a short-lived colonial experiment — or fiasco, depending on your perspective — that merged three adjacent territories with historically disparate relationships to the British Empire. Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) was a self-governing colony founded by the British South Africa Company; Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and Nyasaland (now Malawi) had been demarcated as British protectorates. The decision to conglomerate the three territories into one came from the colonialists, whose motivations were exploitatively economic and crudely economical.

Colonial officers had brought some of the tribal chiefs in line by appointing them to largely nominal positions in the native authorities. But the younger, educated, radical Africans — some of whom fought for the British in World War II — wanted more say in their fate. They resisted federation fiercely. They spoke up from their positions on local councils. They staged protests and boycotts: “Down with federation! To hell with federation!” They were worried by the fact that federation would move the center of power to Southern Rhodesia, whose more deeply entrenched system of segregation, the Jim Crow-like “color bar” — Africans couldn’t go to bars, hotels or movie theaters at the same time as Europeans — seemed destined to seep into the neighboring territories if they were merged.

The choice of where on the Zambezi River to build a dam was dictated by the same gravitational shift. The river’s source was in the northwest of the nascent federation, near the border with Angola and what was then the Belgian Congo. It curled down through Northern Rhodesia before heading east, following — in fact constituting — its border with Southern Rhodesia, then slanting across Mozambique to its mouth in the Indian Ocean. The largest tributary of the Zambezi was the Kafue, which flowed into it from the north at the center of the segment of the river between the two Rhodesias. Just south of that confluence of currents was a gorge known as Kariba.

From the mid-1940s on, there was debate about whether to build a dam on the Kafue or at Kariba. Northern Rhodesia had decided to begin construction on the Kafue, which was closer to the Copperbelt, a valuable mining hub and urban center. The Kafue runs through natural floodplains. A dam there — which was eventually completed in the 1970s — would be smaller and more complicated to build but cause far less trouble for the people and the environment. After the federation was formed in 1953, however, Southern Rhodesia fought for the Kariba Dam to be built first. At that crucial juncture, why did the federation’s government follow the Kariba fork?

It was a question of power. A French engineer, André Coyne, advocated the Kariba site because it would supply more power, at greater value for the cost. The Southern Rhodesians also wanted the dam to be closer to the new seat of political power in the federation’s capital, Salisbury. The larger Kariba Dam would be a technological triumph and a grand imperial project, raising the reputation of the backwater colonies. Newsweek later described it as a monument to “the know-how of Western capital”: “When the Zambezi River was harnessed, the queen mother cheered.”

Coyne’s French company designed the double curvature dam; an Italian company, Impresit, was hired to build it; the World Bank granted a loan to pay for it. The Kariba Lake Development Company — largely made up of British personnel — was established in 1957 to conduct research and piece together some ad hoc environmental and social regulations. There was barely any assessment of the potential ecological impact of the dam, much less the human costs.

So it was only in the middle of construction that the federation’s government began to take seriously the question of what to do with the 57,000 people who lived in the Gwembe Valley that was to be flooded to build the dam — a place where, for centuries, they’d fished in the Zambezi and farmed on soil made rich by seasonal floods, a place they called home.

The word kariba was a corruption of kariva or kaliba, a local term meaning “trap.” It already named a place on the river, a massive stone slab that jutted out of the water at the opening of the gorge. One legend among the local Tonga people claimed that this rock was one of three that had once formed a kind of bridge across the river — a lintel that resembled the animal traps they used — until a flood washed the other two away. It was the sole remnant of a geological event — and from another point of view, a warning. Other legends said that this was the home of a river god named Nyaminyami, with the head of a fish and the twisting whirlpool-like body of a snake. The British took one look at that big rock and decided it was the best place to build a dam, and the best word — mispronounced because they couldn’t wrap their lips around the soft “b” and “l” common in Bantu languages — to explain to the Tonga exactly what a dam was.

Trap a river? The notion was so outlandish that the Tonga began to ignore the district commissioners, who despaired of convincing the villagers — only a few of whom had ever even witnessed electricity — that the dam was really going to be built, that their ancestral homes would soon be underwater. As David Howarth puts it in his blinkered but engaging 1961 history of the Kariba, “The Shadow of the Dam,” “the whole idea of stopping the river was absurd” for the Tonga: “Most of them admitted that the Europeans would probably try, but the Europeans did not know the river as the Tonga knew it; and the old men argued that if anyone thought he could stop the river by building a wall across it, it only showed he had no idea how strong the river was. Let them try … the river will push the wall over, or run round the ends of it.”

This is exactly what happened. Seasonal rains can swell the Zambezi up to 20 times its dry-season size. In late 1956, news came from upriver that an “exceptional flood” — so exceptional it would come to be called the Hundred Years’ Flood — was on its way. The water rose 66 feet and drowned the cofferdam that was in place for construction. When the waters finally subsided, only a crane had been lost, but the engineers were shaken by the unexpected and awesome sight of the torrential deluge.

They built a second cofferdam higher — but not high enough. The very next rainy season, the tributaries joined forces once more. This time the chances were deemed one in a thousand. The Thousand Years’ Flood of 1958 swept away a suspension bridge, which “writhed like a snake when the water touched it.” The river rose 116 feet to the top of the second cofferdam and poured over it, creating a waterfall 28 feet high. The Tonga had been roundly mocked for superstitious predictions that the “huge serpent” living in the Zambezi would “be angry with the white man’s wall and knock it down.” Now, the journalist Frank Clements declared: “Nyaminyami had made good his threat. He had recaptured the gorge.”

The dam seemed cursed. Late in the construction, some scaffolding gave way. Seventeen workers fell into a hole and were buried in wet concrete. Some say their remains were picked out, others that they remain entombed in the dam. When the floods receded, the engineers rushed to make sure the dam was complete before the following rainy season.

This meant that the wildlife now urgently needed to be rescued before the Gwembe Valley became the largest man-made lake in the world. “Operation Noah,” as it was messianically named by white conservationists, managed to capture and remove 6,000 animals, though thousands more died in the floods. (This focus on the wildlife as the principal victims has persisted as the central story of Kariba; a recent BBC article about the dam revolves around a lone baboon “marooned” on an island in the Zambezi.)

The people proved to be more intransigent than the animals when it came to forced resettlement. The government determined that the Tonga were to move to Lusitu, an area to the north, and began resettling 193 villages one at a time, carting the people and their property there in trucks. These new lands had poor, stony soil. There was an almost immediate outbreak of dysentery. The Tonga way of farming, which relied on seasonal floods and leaving land fallow, wasn’t possible here. The ratio of population to land was radically unbalanced. Traditional laws regarding the distribution of property were upended.

Those who had not yet left the Gwembe Valley, already concerned about the disruption of ancestral shrines and the lack of adequate compensation for the loss of their homeland, now had even less reason to leave. Some had been radicalized by the African National Congress — a nascent, nonviolent political party whose members agitated for the breakup of the federation and later led the movements that decolonized its three nations. The congress encouraged civil disobedience in the face of the relocation.

As is often the colonial way, over time the federation’s persuasion campaign gave way to insistence, then violence. The laws of Northern Rhodesia in fact prohibited forced removal, so the Tonga Native Authority was persuaded to approve a legal order, which was translated and broadcast to the people: “The Government is quite satisfied that the Lusitu plan is in your best interests and now intends to carry out this move without delay. Those who resist will be moved by force, using the police you see here today…. Anybody who obstructs the move will be prosecuted. When people have moved from a village, the huts will be destroyed.”

The people rebelled. The villagers of Chisamu, who were governed by a chief named Chipepo, made a series of charges at the police, shouting and gesturing with their spears, playing drums and singing war songs. The standoff lasted for days, the police conducting drills, Chipepo’s people imitating them. “They marched and countermarched in single file,” Howarth writes, “carrying their spears like rifles on their shoulders, and instructors marched at the sides of the columns like sergeants or platoon commanders. Sometimes it looked like a parody, but perhaps they did it to convince themselves.” The governor of Northern Rhodesia was brought in for an indaba with the leaders, but to no avail. When the constables moved in on the villagers, violence broke out. Eight Tonga were shot and killed. The people relented.

The dam was completed. The valley was flooded. Nowadays, fishing boats and “sunset cruises” slip up and down the dwindling lake above the dam. The eeriest, most beautiful thing about Lake Kariba — its main attraction for tourists — is that the submerged trees of the Gwembe Valley still stand. You can see them reaching up from the depths, branching up out of the water, forking against the sky

“The whole might of modern technology was nearly caught by the primeval, savage forces of Africa,” Clements wrote of the Kariba in 1959. With this Manichaean hyperbole, he tidily conflates the power of nature, the myth of Nyaminyami and the resistance of the Tonga, even as he diminishes all three. In the end, the might of modern technology won, escaped the trap — or perhaps became one. Many historians cast the story of the Kariba Dam as a paternalistic tale about how a zealous belief in “progress” overwhelmed a hapless tribe of what David Livingstone once called a “degraded” people. Another way to see it is that the building of the Kariba Dam redirected enormous wealth to colonial parties at the expense of the rightful dwellers of the Gwembe Valley, who are now considered “development refugees” and lack adequate access to water and electricity. As late as 2000, three of the nearby districts where the Tonga now live were still not connected to the national grid lines.

This dam business now directs wealth to neocolonial parties. The China National Complete Engineering Corporation is building another $449 million megadam on a tributary of the Zambezi. Within its own borders, the Chinese government is turning away from hydroelectricity and toward solar and wind energy. They know that, in the midst of a global climate-change crisis, finding alternatives to dams is better than trying to fix them.

Africans know it, too. In 2014, Partson Mbiriri, then the chairman of the Zambezi River Authority, told the BBC, “It’s equally important to think about solar — on the assumption, of course, that we’ll continue to have sunshine.” While various figures of authority — colonial, governmental, environmentalist, journalistic; then and now, well-meaning and mercenary — have all been deeply concerned to explain to Africans what will happen to us if we do not move out of the path of progress, they have never really bothered to listen to us.

The Africans of the federation did in fact articulate a set of prescient questions and demands — subjunctive possibilities. In 1955, the Northern Rhodesian African National Congress leader, Harry Nkumbula, wrote to the queen of England, asking her to appoint a commission including Africans “to determine whether it is just that the people should be dispossessed of their land”; whether the power generated by the dam “could not be better generated by nuclear energy”; whether the compensation the people received was sufficient and whether “the lands to which the people are being moved are equal in value” and fertility to those that would be flooded. Perhaps human folly is culturally relative.

When they were first informed about the dam, the Gwembe Native Authority made a set of 24 demands respecting their rights — to land, property, reparations, protection, information. The 11th was: “That in moving people, their choices shall be seriously considered before they shall be ignored.” And when Chipepo’s people staged their ultimately futile uprising, they wrote messages in English, which they sent to the district officers and the native authorities or nailed to trees on the battlefield: “We shall die in our land…. We don’t want to be removed to Lusitu or to any place. We will not go home until you dismiss your army of policemen. We will not fight with weapons but with words.” What would paying attention and respect to their words have made possible?

The Tonga knew the Zambezi. They knew that a river keeps time, not like a clock but like a chronicle. They knew its sediments and grooves, the patterns of the beings dwelling within it and nearby, its might and its tendencies. Kariva rock itself was testament to a river that had knocked away its stony triplets, a river so powerful that it seemed that a god must live inside it.

A river can channel water into an immense power. A river can also flood, spread into the spaces open to it. A river is both a singular, driving force and a distributive, branching one. The Tonga had long lived peacefully on both sides of the Zambezi, crossing back and forth to court brides, borrow food, visit relatives. They knew that you don’t stop a river; you move over, through and with it. You follow its paths. You may step into it as often as you wish, but you do not stay.

ILULISSAT, Greenland — On a clear day in August, a helicopter set me and a few companions down on the northern end of the Jakobshavn Glacier in Western Greenland, about 150 miles north of the Arctic Circle. The ground under our feet seemed almost lunar: gray silt and dust, loose rocks and boulders, and, at the edge of the glacier’s face, mud so deep it nearly ate my boots. To the south, the calving front of the glacier known in Greenlandic as Sermeq Kujalleq periodically deposited enormous slabs of ice, some more than 100 feet high, into the open water. I asked the pilot to give me a sense of how much the glacier had retreated since he had been flying the route. He pointed to a distant rocky island in the middle of the fjord. “That’s where the glacier was in 2007,” he said. Over the course of the 20th century, the Jakobshavn Glacier retreated about 10 to 15 kilometers. Over just the next eight years, it retreated about the same amount, according to the oceanographer Josh Willis of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Later the front advanced a little — a function of complex dynamics partly involving ocean currents — before resuming its retreat. For anyone who has entertained doubts about the warming of the planet, a trip to Greenland serves as a bracing corrective. Flying low over the vast ice sheet that covers most of the island, I immediately noticed large ponds of cerulean meltwater and dozens of fast-flowing streams rushing through gullies of white ice and sometimes disappearing into vertical ice caverns thousands of feet deep. Such lakes, scientists report, have become far more common over the last two decades, occurring earlier in the year at higher elevations. Last year, it even rained at the highest point of the ice sheet, some 500 miles north of the Arctic Circle. That’s a first since record keeping began in the 1980s. Closer to the coast, at the point where the sheet approaches the darkly colored mountains that ring the island, lies a distinctive, beige trimline of barren earth, ranging in width from hundreds to thousands of meters. Like the bathtub rings in the depleted lakes and reservoirs of the American West, it shows where the ice once reached, and how far it has receded. History also records that Greenland’s great 19th-century explorers — men like Fridtjof Nansen of Norway and Robert Peary of America — had to climb steep glacial walls merely to get onto the sheet itself. Now it is easy to spot places where the ice meets the dry land on flat ground. And then there’s the testimony of the market. In the coastal town of Ilulissat, I had dinner with Bo Møller Stensgaard, a geologist and the C.E.O. of Bluejay Mining, which plans to mine for copper, nickel, cobalt, zinc and ilmenite. The receding of the ice sheet has opened additional land for exploration, Stensgaard said, and warmer weather has lengthened the season when ships can travel to the island without the risk of being frozen in. “I can put people in the field longer,” he said. Having spent long months in tents doing geological fieldwork, he sees the transformation not just as an entrepreneur. “I’ve seen glaciers disappear completely,” he said. “I’ve seen starving polar bears because of disappearing sea ice. These are personally disturbing changes.” But, since the minerals he hopes to mine are critical for any future green-energy transition, climate change is creating opportunities in Greenland to address the reason it is melting. For years, I saw myself not as a global-warming denier (a loaded term with its tendentious echo of Holocaust denial) but rather as an agnostic on the causes of climate change and a scoffer at the idea that it was a catastrophic threat to the future of humanity. It’s not that I was unalterably opposed to the idea that, by pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, modern civilization was contributing to the warming by 1 degree Celsius and the inches of sea-level rise the planet had experienced since the dawn of the industrial age. It’s that the severity of the threat seemed to me wildly exaggerated and that the proposed cures all smacked of old-fashioned statism mixed with new-age religion. Hadn’t we repeatedly lived through previous alarms about other, allegedly imminent, environmental catastrophes that didn’t come to pass, like the belief, widespread in the 1970s, that overpopulation would inevitably lead to mass starvation? And if the Green Revolution had spared us from that Malthusian nightmare, why should we not have confidence that human ingenuity wouldn’t also prevent the parade of horribles that climate change was supposed to bring about? I had other doubts, too. It seemed hubristic, or worse, to make multitrillion-dollar policy bets based on computer models trying to forecast climate patterns decades into the future. Climate activists kept promoting policies based on technologies that were either far from mature (solar energy) or sometimes actively harmful (biofuels). Expensive efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and North America seemed particularly fruitless when China, India and other developing countries weren’t about to curb their own appetite for fossil fuels. There was also a millenarian fervor that bothered me about climate activism, with its apocalyptic imagery (the Statue of Liberty underwater) and threats of doom unless we were willing to live far more frugally. That was my frame of mind when, in April 2017, I wrote my first column for The Times, “Climate of Complete Certainty.” The blowback was intense. Climate scientists denounced me in open letters; petitions were circulated demanding that I be fired. The response mainly hardened my conviction that climate activists were guilty of precisely what I charged them with: intellectual self-certainty that is often a prescription for disaster. Among the signatories of one petition was an oceanographer, John Englander, who runs an educational and advocacy group, the Rising Seas Institute. Two years later, on a visit to New York, he wrote me out of the blue and asked to meet. Unlike most of my detractors, his note was so cordial that it seemed churlish to say no. We met the next day. Englander is a trim, affable and eloquent man of 72 who once ran the Cousteau Society and reminds me of a bearded Patrick Stewart, albeit with an American accent. His pitch was simple: The coastline we have taken for granted for thousands of years of human history changed rapidly in the past on account of natural forces — and would soon be changing rapidly and disastrously by man-made ones. A trip to Greenland, which holds one-eighth of the world’s ice on land (most of the rest is in Antarctica) would show me just how drastic those changes have been. Would I join him? Again, it seemed churlish to say no (though the pandemic would delay my trip by two years). More to the point, if my main objection to the climate activists was my impression of their overweening certitude, didn’t it behoove me to check my own? Where — except in the risk of changing my mind — was the harm in testing my views?

But we need to recognize

clean energy’s limitations. But we need to

From a jetliner , the most striking features of Greenland seem to be its vastness and its blankness, which put me in mind of a line from Robert Frost’s poem “Desert Places”: “A blanker whiteness of benighted snow/With no expression, nothing to express.” It was only when I got to the sheet itself that I realized the line could not be less apt. Trapped in the whiteness was a story about the world’s distant past and potential future. Greenland is about the size of Alaska and California combined and, except at its coasts, is covered by ice that in places is nearly two miles thick. Even that’s only a fraction of the ice in Antarctica, which is more than six times as large. But the Arctic is warming at nearly four times the global average, meaning Greenland’s ice also poses a nearer-term risk because it is melting faster. If all its ice were to melt, global sea levels would rise by some 24 feet. That would be more than enough to inundate hundreds of coastal cities in scores of nations, from Jakarta and Bangkok to Copenhagen and Amsterdam to Miami and New Orleans. But just how fast is Greenland’s ice melting right now? Is this an emergency for our time, or is it a problem for the future? Measuring ice loss on scales so vast is no easy task, since Greenland, like a spendthrift billionaire, is both constantly accumulating and shedding almost unfathomable quantities of ice over long spans of time. But scientists have been drilling ice-core samples from Greenland for decades, giving them a very good idea of climatic changes stretching back thousands of years. Better yet, a pair of satellites that detect anomalies in Earth’s gravity fields has been taking measurements of the sheet regularly for nearly 20 years, giving scientists a much more precise idea of what is happening. The data shows unmistakably that Greenland’s ice is not in balance. It is losing far more than it is gaining. From April 2002 to July 2022, Greenland has lost more than 5,000 gigatons of ice to the ocean 250 miles Greenland Jakobshavn Glacier Ice mass change relative to 2002 +0.5 no change –1 –2 –3 –4 –5 meters of ice 250 miles Greenland Jakobshavn Glacier Ice mass change relative to 2002 +0.5 no change –1 –2 –3 –4 –5 meters of ice Source: NASA In Copenhagen before my departure for Greenland, I chatted with Liam Colgan, a Canadian research climatologist with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. “We haven’t had a good positive mass balance year since the late 1990s,” he told me in a follow-on email when I asked him to explain the data for me. The losses can vary sharply by year. The annualized average over the past 30 years, he added, is 170 gigatons per year. That’s the equivalent of about 5,400 tons of ice loss per second. That “suggests that Greenland ice loss has been tracking the I.P.C.C. worse-case, highest-carbon-emission scenario.” (The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the U.N. body that assesses climate change.) Still, it’s hard to forecast with any precision what that means. “Anyone who says they know what the sea level is going to be in 2100 is giving you an educated guess,” said NASA’s Willis. “The fact is, we’re seeing these big ice sheets melt for the first time in history, and we don’t really know how fast they can go.” His own educated guess: “By 2100, we are probably looking at more than a foot or two and hopefully less than seven or eight feet. But we are struggling to figure out just how fast the ice sheets can melt. So the upper end of range is still not well known.” On the face of it, that sounds manageable. Even if sea levels rise by eight feet, won’t the world have nearly 80 years to come to grips with the problem, during which technologies that help us mitigate the effects of climate change while adapting to its consequences are likely to make dramatic advances? Won’t the world — including countries that today are poor — become far richer and thus more capable of weathering the floods, surges and superstorms?

But we’ve gotten better at

mitigating climate disasters. But we’ve gotten

climate disasters.

Englander isn’t at all sanguine. The average rate at which sea level is rising around the world, he estimates, has more than tripled over the past three decades, to five millimeters a year from 1.5 millimeters. That may still seem minute, yet as the world learned during the pandemic, exponential increases have a way of hitting hard. “When something is on a straight line or a smooth curve, you can plot its trajectory,” Englander said. “But sea level, like earthquakes and mudslides, is something that happens irregularly and can change rather quickly and surprise us. The point is, you can no longer predict the future by the recent past.” Another major wild card is Antarctica, where the average rate of ice mass loss is more than 150 gigatons a year. Shortly after I returned from Greenland, a glacier in West Antarctica called Thwaites, roughly the size of Florida, caught the world’s attention when a study suggested it was, according to a co-author, Robert Larter of the British Antarctic Survey, “holding on today by its fingernails.” Or was that alarmist? In The Wall Street Journal’s editorial pages, where I used to work, the theoretical physicist Steven Koonin, a former under secretary for science in the Obama administration’s Energy Department, cast doubt on the threat from Thwaites in a voice that could have once been mine. He also thinks the risks associated with Greenland’s melting are less a product of human-induced global warming than of natural cycles in North Atlantic currents and temperatures, which over time have a way of regressing to the mean. “Much climate reporting today highlights short-term changes when they fit the narrative of a broken climate but then ignores or plays down changes when they don’t, often dismissing them as ‘just weather,’” he wrote in February. Another climate nonalarmist is Roger Pielke Jr., a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. I call Pielke a nonalarmist rather than a skeptic because he readily acknowledges that the challenges associated with climate change, including sea-level rise, are real, serious and probably unstoppable, at least for many decades. But that is also the source of his (relative) optimism. “If we have to have a problem,” he told me when I reached him by phone, “we probably want one with a slow onset that we can see coming. It’s not like an asteroid coming from space.” Among Pielke’s areas of expertise is the analysis of long-term trends in weather and climate-related disasters. Even as the nominal cost of hurricanes, floods, fires and droughts has grown, the economic impact of these disasters relative to the overall size of the economy continues to fall, a function of better forecasting, infrastructure, planning and responsiveness when disaster strikes — all of which, in turn, are the result of the massive increase in wealth the world has enjoyed in the past century. “Since the 1940s, the impact of floods as a proportion of U.S. gross domestic product has dropped by 70 percent-plus,” Pielke said. “We see this around the world, across phenomena. The story is that fewer people are dying and we are having less damage proportional to G.D.P.” A considerable amount of data bears Pielke out. In the 1920s, the estimated average annual death toll from natural catastrophes around the globe averaged more than 500,000 a year. The 1931 China floods alone killed as many as four million people not only through drowning but also by exposure, disease and famine. A more recent example, the 1970 Bhola cyclone, killed as many as half a million people in what is now Bangladesh. In the 2010s, the annual average death toll was below 50,000 — a tenth of what it was a century ago. Hurricane Ian, among the strongest storms ever to hit Florida, had a death toll of at least 119, a small fraction of the 8,000 believed killed by the Great Galveston hurricane of 1900 Even the poorest countries, while still unacceptably vulnerable, are suffering far fewer human and economic losses to climate-related disasters. Global warming is real and getting worse, Pielke said, yet still it’s possible that humanity will be able to adapt to, and compensate for, its effects. The death rate from natural disasters has fallen globally Average number of deaths per 100,000 people, by decade 25 deaths per 100k 20 15 10 5 1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 25 deaths per 100k 20 15 10 5 1910 1930 1950 1970 1990 2010 Source: EM-DAT Note: Natural disasters include all geophysical, meteorological and climate events like earthquakes, volcanic activity, landslides, drought, wildfires, storms and flooding. Or maybe not. A few years ago, I would have found voices like Koonin’s and Pielke’s persuasive. Now I’m less sure. What intervened was a pandemic. Just as I had once scoffed at the idea of climate doom, I had also, for almost identical reasons, dismissed predictions of another catastrophic pandemic on a par with the 1918-20 influenza outbreak. After all, hadn’t we pushed through previous alarms involving Ebola, SARS, MERS and vCJD (mad cow disease) without immense loss of life? Hadn’t virology, epidemiology, public hygiene, drug development and medicine all come a long way since the end of World War I, rendering comparisons with past pandemics mostly moot? That’s what I thought until the spring of 2020, when, along with everyone else, I experienced how swiftly and implacably nature can overwhelm even the richest and most technologically advanced societies. It was a lesson in the sort of intellectual humility I recommended for others and began to realize I could use more of myself. It was also a lesson in thinking about risk, especially those in the category known as high-impact, low-probability events that seem to be hitting us with such regularity in this century: the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001; the tsunamis of 2004 and 2011, the mass upheavals in the Arab world that began with a Tunisian street vendor’s self-immolation. Here were some questions that gnawed at me: What if the past does nothing to predict the future? What if climate risks do not evolve gradually and relatively predictably but instead suddenly soar uncontrollably? How much lead time is required to deal with something like sea-level rise? How do we weigh the risks of underreacting to climate change against the risks of overreacting to it? I called Seth Klarman, one of the world’s most successful hedge-fund managers, to think through questions of risk. While he’s not an expert on climate change, he has spent decades thinking deeply about every manner of risk. He’s also one of the rare people with a capacity to change his mind — including, he readily acknowledges, about climate risk. “I’ve talked to so many experts and seen so much evidence,” he told me over Zoom, “I’m convinced the climate is changing, and addressing climate change has become a philanthropic priority of mine.” “If you face something that is potentially existential,” he explained, “existential for nations, even for life as we know it, even if you thought the risk is, say, 5 percent, you’d want to hedge against it.” How? “One thing we try to do,” he said, “is we buy protection when it’s really inexpensive, even when we think we may well not need it.” The forces contributing to climate change, he noted, echoing Englander, “might be irreversible sooner than the damage from climate change has become fully apparent. You can’t say it’s far off and wait when, if you had acted sooner, you might have dealt with it better and at less cost. We have to act now.” In other words, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. That’s particularly true if climate change is akin to cancer — manageable or curable in its earlier stages, disastrous in its later ones. For Klarman, the simplest and most obvious climate hedge is a carbon tax. By “raising the price of oil, gas and coal to make alternative energy more economically attractive,” he said, “capitalists will be incentivized to act.” Klarman recognizes that such a tax is easier said than done because, if it’s enacted by only a few nations, it becomes more of a form of virtue signaling than a serious climate change policy. Carbon taxes also tend to impose their burdens inequitably, favoring city dwellers over exurban and rural ones, knowledge businesses over manufacturers. There’s a reason Barack Obama rejected a carbon tax, knowing it could be deeply unpopular among voters, and why France’s carbon tax sparked the “yellow vest” public revolt that has energized the far right. As I’ve always believed, knowing there is grave risk to future generations — and expecting current ones to make immediate sacrifices for it — defies most of what we know about human nature. So I began to think more deeply about that challenge, and others.

When I had dinner with Stensgaard, the mining executive, he mentioned a statistic that stunned me. For the world to achieve the net-zero goal for carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency, we will have to mine, by 2040, six times the current amounts of critical minerals — nickel, cobalt, copper, lithium, manganese, graphite, chromium, rare earths and other minerals and elements — needed for electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels. And we will almost certainly have to do it from sources other than Russia, China, the Democratic Republic of Congo and other places that pose unacceptable strategic, environmental or humanitarian risks. To bring carbon emissions to net zero, the world needs significantly more minerals Global demand for minerals like copper, nickel, lithium and graphite, by type of clean energy What we used in 2020 What we’ll need in 2040 Electric vehicles and batteries 54x as many 0.4 million tons of minerals 21.5 Electricity networks 3x as many 5.0 13.9 5x Solar The I.E.A. estimates that the world will need three times as many minerals for its electricity networks in 2040 to meet net zero. 0.7 3.3 5x Wind 2.9 0.6 What we used in 2020 What we’ll need in 2040 Electric vehicles and batteries 54x as many 0.4 million tons of minerals 21.5 Electricity networks 3x as many 5.0 13.9 Solar The I.E.A. estimates that the world will need three times as many minerals for its electricity networks in 2040 to meet net zero. 5x 0.7 3.3 Wind 5x 0.6 2.9 Source: International Energy Agency That should be great news for people like Stensgaard — provided Greenlanders are willing to go along. Across the iceberg-strewn bay from where we dined lies Disko Island, twice the size of Long Island and home to around 1,000 people. According to Stensgaard, it is believed to contain 12 million to 16 million tons of nickel. To put that figure in perspective, Stensgaard told me that according to one estimate, the Norilsk nickel mine in Russia, one of the largest in the world, has produced about 8.3 million tons since the 1940s. A world committed to net zero will need many more Disko Islands to supply its “clean” energy needs. I put the word “clean” in quotation marks because the term is a misnomer. As in everything else in life, so too with the environment: There is no such thing as a free lunch. Whether it’s nuclear, biofuels, natural gas, hydroelectric or, yes, wind and solar, there will always be serious environmental downsides to any form of energy when used on a massive scale. A single industrial-size wind turbine, for instance, typically requires about a ton of rare earth metals as well as three metric tons of copper, which is notoriously destructive and dirty to mine. Just as significantly, as I’ve long believed, no “clean energy” solution will easily liberate us from our overwhelming and, for now, inescapable dependence on fossil fuels.

But we need solutions that

align with human nature. But we need

solutions that align with

human nature.

Nobody brings the point home better than Vaclav Smil, the Canadian polymath whose most recent book, “How the World Really Works,” should be required reading for policymakers and anyone else interested in a serious discussion about potential climate solutions. Many people tend to think of fossil fuels mostly in terms of transportation, electrical generation and heating. But how often do we consider the necessity of fossil fuels in the production of nitrogen fertilizer, without which, Smil noted, “it would be impossible to feed at least 40 percent and up to 50 percent of today’s nearly eight billion people”? It’s difficult to imagine modern life without plastics, made mainly from the hydrocarbons ethylene and propylene, or steel, made with coking coal and natural gas, or cement or asphalt. Some critics respond to Smil’s arguments with a type of heroic optimism that borders on magical thinking. Why, they ask, can’t we do more to grow our food organically and distribute and consume it locally? The only way we could do that and make a meaningful difference for the climate is if millions of us returned to farming, while accepting a world that can feed far fewer people. Or they cheer investments in wind and solar power without adequately considering that merely increasing the supply of renewable energy does very little to diminish a continued overall demand for fossil fuels, because we have yet to solve the intermittence problem: The sun doesn’t always shine, the wind doesn’t always blow, and we haven’t figured out how to store extra energy at the necessary scale. The poster child for this kind of magical thinking is Germany, which undertook a historic Energiewende — “energy revolution” — only to come up short. At the turn of the century, Germany got about 85 percent of its primary energy from fossil fuels. Now it gets about 78 percent, a puny reduction, considering that the country has spent massive sums on renewables to increase the share of electricity it generates from them. What went wrong? Many things, not least Angela Merkel’s abrupt decision to shut down all of Germany’s nuclear power plants right after the Fukushima disaster of 2011. That forced Germany to lean more heavily on coal, foreign oil and gas. Now Germany faces a winter with the prospect of uncertain energy supplies from its former partners in Moscow. Things could turn a corner once scientists finally figure out a technical solution to the energy storage problem. Or when governments and local actors get over their NIMBYism when it comes to permitting and building a large energy grid to move electricity from Germany’s windy north to its energy-hungry south. Or when thoughtful environmental activists finally come to grips with the necessity of nuclear energy — one of the few energy sources, along with hydroelectric power, that combine reliability, energy density and no direct carbon emissions. Till then, even as I’ve come to accept the danger we face, I think it’s worth extending the cancer metaphor a little further: Just as cancer treatments, when they work at all, can have terrible side effects, much the same can be said of climate treatments: The gap between an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment remains dismayingly wide. The problem has become clearer to me; the solution hasn’t.

But we need to avoid

alarmist activism. But we need to avoid

alarmist activism.

Maybe, I realized, in assessing my newfound concerns about climate change, my long-held beliefs might provide a solution — look to the market. The way we’ve dealt with other vast and persistent problems provides some lessons. For many decades, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, U.S. Agency for International Development and other agencies, foreign and domestic, pumped trillions of dollars into some of the world’s poorest countries, with ingenious development schemes that fell apart on contact with local realities. The developing world got stuck in debt traps, aid-fueled corruption and debilitating cycles of dependency. Only when countries like Vietnam and China turned to a different model, of largely bottom-up, market-driven development, did hundreds of millions of people get lifted out of destitution. Or consider another remarkable fact noted by Smil: In the United States, the difference between total water consumption in 1965 and 2015 is less than 4 percent. In the same span of time, population grew by more than 60 percent. Laws, regulations and growing environmental awareness played important roles. So did increasing urbanization: More people living in apartments means fewer lawns that need to be watered. But the most important transformation has come in agriculture, which uses about 70 percent of the world’s freshwater supply. Farmers gradually adopted sprinkler and drip irrigation systems, rather than more wasteful flood irrigation, not to conserve water but because the technology provided higher crop yields and larger profit margins.

1313,2025-03-13,The Salmon Are Thriving. So Are Many of the People. Why Would Anyone Shut This Down?,"But none of these depredations produced as much environmental damage as the undermining of the upper basin’s hydrology carried out by farmers, ranchers and their allies in the federal government. Early in the 20th century, they drained two of the Klamath’s three largest lakes and most of its wetlands to create agricultural fields. The loss of those two lakes and about 80 percent⁠ of the basin’s wetlands is the blow from which the upper basin can’t recover⁠.

It’s perhaps unjust to label the lake-drainers as villains, as they were merely mimicking what had already happened throughout much of the United States in the 19th century⁠, and they were oblivious to drainage’s long-term consequences. But over time it eliminated the upper basin water systems’ resilience.

Before Euro-Americans’ arrival, the upper basin was a unique watery landscape miraculously perched on top of sagebrush-dry terrain, in the 4,000-foot-altitude high desert of south-central Oregon and far northeastern California. Upper Klamath Lake, the lake that survives, was smaller than Tule Lake and Lower Klamath Lake, the two drained lakes. The three lakes, nestled close to one another at slightly different altitudes and interspersed with large tracts of wetlands, each had their own rhythm and composition: Tule Lake’s water level, for example, rose and fell over a 20-year cycle⁠, while Lower Klamath Lake fluctuated on a seasonal and yearly basis⁠.

The variations from lake to lake and from lake to wetlands fostered biodiversity. Two species of suckers are sacred to the Klamath Tribes of Oregon, the predominant upper basin tribe that is an agglomeration of three separate tribes required by the federal government in 1864; a juvenile sucker could grow up in relatively protected wetland waters, then circulate as an adult in more treacherous Upper Klamath Lake. But without the wetlands and two of the three lakes, the sucker population was vulnerable. By the 1990s, populations of the two sucker species had plummeted, and they are now on the verge of extinction.

To the farmers and ranchers of the early 20th century, the wetlands were useless quagmires, riddled with insects and inhospitable to humans — the word “wetlands” didn’t even come into common usage until the 1950s, when their invaluable ecosystem benefits began to be understood.",U.S. drained two of the Klamath's three largest lakes and most of its wetlands to create agricultural fields.

1314,2025-03-10,The Otherworldly California Waterway That Keeps Exploding Into Politics,"The sprawling estuary about 70 miles inland from San Francisco feels distinctly out of place — more like the swampy Florida Everglades than arid California. But from that confluence of two great rivers, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin, 1,100 miles of webbed waterways and levees send upward of six million acre-feet of freshwater a year to thirstier parts of the state, from farms in the San Joaquin Valley to the Southern California megalopolis. Known as the California Delta, the estuary is among the state’s most important sources of water — and most consistent flashpoints over environmental protection.

Donald Trump first saw the political utility of the estuary in 2016 on the campaign trail, when he denied the existence of a drought in California, claiming that the state had wasted its precious freshwater by sending it into the ocean. He was referring to a fight over diverting water from the Delta to protect a native fish species called the delta smelt, and he was implicitly siding with farmers who argued they were more deserving of the water than the federally threatened species. He revisited this battle in his first term as president, but environmentalists stopped him in the courts from redirecting more water to farmers.","The California Delta is among the state’s most important sources of water. 1,100 miles of webbed waterways and levees send upward of six million acre-feet of freshwater a year.",1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,-0.7589,[],"['Delta', 'Sacramento', 'San Francisco']"

But in recent years, many have been unable to afford basic necessities — much less the cost of a sheep to slaughter for one of Islam’s holiest festivals.

So when King Mohammed VI, citing “climate and economic challenges,” urged people last week not to buy sheep to slaughter for this year’s feast in June, it brought much-needed relief to the many Moroccans feeling torn between their faith, their traditions and their drained finances.

“Performing it under these difficult circumstances would cause certain harm to large segments of our people — especially those with limited incomes,” the king, who is also Morocco’s religious leader, said in a letter read by Ahmed Toufiq, the Islamic affairs minister, on state-owned television. “I will perform the Eid sacrifice rite, God willing, on behalf of my people,” the king added.

The country’s deep economic woes have worsened over seven years of drought, exacerbated by periods of extreme heat that scientists have linked to climate change. Recent rainfall has been 53 percent lower than the average of the last 30 years, according to the agriculture ministry.

As Los Angeles burned for days on end, horrifying the nation, scientists made an announcement on Friday that could help explain the deadly conflagration: 2024 was the hottest year in recorded history.

With temperatures rising around the globe and the oceans unusually warm, scientists are warning that the world has entered a dangerous new era of chaotic floods, storms and fires made worse by human-caused climate change.

The firestorms ravaging the country’s second-largest city are just the latest spasm of extreme weather that is growing more furious as well as more unpredictable. Wildfires are highly unusual in Southern California in January, which is supposed to be the rainy season. The same is true for cyclones in Appalachia, where Hurricanes Helene and Milton shocked the country when they tore through mountain communities in October.

1318,2025-01-01,"The Panama Canal Has a Big Problem, but It’s Not China or Trump","Here’s why. Sending a single ship through the canal’s locks can use around 50 million gallons of water, mainly freshwater collected from Lake Gatún. Though the canal is, for the moment, operating at full capacity, a drier climate and greater demand for drinking water have in recent years reduced the volume of available water. That has forced the state-run Panama Canal Authority at times to limit the number of daily passages through the canal, at one point by as much as 40 percent.

With less rain, the reservoirs fill up more slowly, which means less water available to operate the locks, which means fewer ships can pass. Hence, the 2023-24 drought, among the worst on record, slowed transits and drove up transit prices, causing long delays, more expensive consumer goods and greater instability in shipping routes. These were probably the increases Mr. Trump referred to as a “rip-off.”

The limited number of passages has led to auctions for passage rights that further inflated the growing cost of shipping goods through the canal. (The canal authority increased tolls just before the 2023 drought began.) In the short term, reduced access causes goods to take longer to reach their destinations, and they cost more when they arrive. Over the medium term, companies have begun to seek alternate routes and different methods of moving goods. Some projects, like a railway corridor across southern Mexico, have emerged to directly compete with the Panama Canal. Over the long term, as trade volume and ship sizes increase while the amount of available water decreases, the canal could well lose market share, declining in both usefulness and strategic importance.

The 2023-24 drought was due in part to a strong El Niño effect, as rising surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean altered weather patterns worldwide. Scientists generally agree that climate change is making El Niño events more frequent and more severe. Higher temperatures have increased the evaporation of water off the reservoir, too, further reducing the water supply.

Mr. Trump’s insinuations about Chinese influence, his demands for lower transit fees and his talk of returning the canal to U.S. control have, of course, not won him admiration in Panama, least of all among civic leaders more concerned with solving the canal’s challenges.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.8235,"['United States', 'Panama', 'China', 'Mexico']",[]

1320,2024-12-28,Why Coffee Prices Are Soaring (Again),"When it comes to coffee, Thaleon Tremain has always tried to ignore what the market is telling him.

As the chief executive and a co-founder of Pachamama Coffee in California, Mr. Tremain sells his specialty beans for more than what the global commodity price might dictate. He wants his customers to think of coffee as a luxury product and pay for it accordingly, so that farmers who grow his beans in countries like Peru, Nicaragua and Ethiopia can cover their costs.

But now, Mr. Tremain is worried that coffee is getting more expensive for the wrong reasons. In recent years, repeated droughts and flooding have strained the global supply of coffee, frequently causing prices to soar, as climate change has done for other staples, like cocoa, olive oil and orange juice. At the same time, global demand for coffee has kept rising, with few signs that java drinkers are cutting back. This month, prices in one market broke a nearly 50-year high.

Even though prices might fall, Mr. Tremain said the volatility threatened the sustainability of businesses like his — and the livelihoods of the farmers who grow his beans. Lattes will probably also eventually get more expensive.

Almost the entire United States faced drought conditions during the last week of October. Only Alaska and Kentucky did not have at least moderate drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a record in the monitor’s history. The past four months were consistently warmer than normal over a wide swath of the country, said Rich Tinker, a drought specialist with the National Weather Service. But in June, while roughly a quarter of the country was dry to some degree, he said, now 87 percent of the nation is. Drought in many parts of the country and the world is becoming more frequent, longer and more severe,” said Erica Fleishman, director of the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute and a professor at Oregon State University.

The article continues to explain the relationship between the drought and weather conditions in October and early November:

Even after Hurricane Helene dropped huge amounts of destructive rain across the Southeast, the region is experiencing drought. Not much rain has fallen since the storm and warmer temperatures mean higher evaporation rates and drier soils. Drought doesn’t just come from a lack of precipitation like rain or snow. Drought conditions are driven by abnormally high temperatures that can quickly suck moisture from the atmosphere and the ground. Even if the total amount of precipitation stays the same or increases a bit, drought can occur. That is especially true as rain events get more episodic, with heavier deluges over a smaller number of events. When all the water comes at once, it’s more difficult for soil to soak it up or for water storage to contain it.

Why are we having such a widespread drought? Benjamin Cook, a climate scientist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, explains:

While scientists don’t yet know the exact role climate change played in the current drought, it is notable for how widespread it is. Oftentimes we get regional droughts concentrated in the Southwest or Texas, but to have nearly the entire country dry or experiencing drought conditions is pretty rare. It’s a tossup whether the coming months will continue to be warm and dry, or if a lot of rain and snow will fall.

What is clear from studying weather patterns is that they are getting more extreme. We will have to adapt our infrastructure, agriculture and water policy to extreme rain, prolonged drought and changing demand for water.

1332,2023-02-16,Scientists Wondered if Warming Caused Argentina’s Drought. The Answer: No.,"In the last three months of 2022, however, the drought became especially severe. Rainfall totals in central Argentina were the lowest in more than half a century, and yields of wheat, soybeans and other crops fell dramatically in prime growing regions there and in Uruguay. Water emergencies were declared in some areas.

Like previous studies by the group, this one used observational data and computer models to compare what occurred late last year with what would have likely occurred in a world that had not warmed by 1.2 degrees Celsius, or 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit, as a result of human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. The work has not yet been peer reviewed, but the techniques the researchers used have been peer reviewed in previous studies.

The analysis looked at rainfall totals for October to December over most of Argentina, all of Uruguay and a small part of southern Brazil. They found that without climate change there was a 5 percent chance that such a period of sharply lower rainfall would occur in any given year.

But climate change did not increase the chances, they found. If anything, climate models show that region of central South America becoming slightly wetter as warming continues, though the researchers said the effect was insignificant and, as appeared to be the case with this drought, could be overwhelmed by natural variability.

The area also experienced record-setting heat waves last November and December. Extreme heat can make droughts worse by increasing the loss of moisture from soil and plants, said Juan Rivera, a researcher at the Argentine Institute for Snow Research, Glaciology and Environmental Sciences, who worked on the study.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.8963,"['Brazil', 'Argentina', 'Uruguay']",[]

The storms inflicted widespread flooding and killed at least 20 people. The onslaught of precipitation also started to refill reservoirs and pile up snowpack in the Sierra Nevada.

Simultaneous flooding and drought are “basically a byproduct of the high variability of California’s climate,” said Jay Lund, co-director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis.

The state typically gets its precipitation during the late fall and winter, much of it from storms fueled by atmospheric rivers, and can go long periods of time in the spring and summer without any rain.

California has built its water infrastructure — reservoirs, wells and irrigation systems — in part to account for the imbalanced timing in precipitation. However, the state’s strategy of capturing water during wet periods and reserving it for dry periods gets “more difficult to implement because of the extremes becoming greater” in a warming climate, Dr. Lund said.

The recent rains resulted in a quick and heavy influx of water into many of the state’s reservoirs. Many have returned to or surpassed average levels, but few are at full capacity.

If reservoir levels continue to creep up above average levels, it could alleviate some deficits that have accumulated over consecutive extreme drought years, said Molly White, an operations manager for the California State Water Project.

“It all helps the overall drought picture,” she added.

California has a naturally variable climate: Periods of drought are punctuated by periods of wetter weather. But research suggests that global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions is making it more likely that any given drought will persist or become more intense, and less likely that any string of wet years will continue.

Climate change will also worsen the wettest extremes. Because warmer air can carry more moisture, atmospheric rivers, which are essentially long plumes of water vapor, will also be able to unleash larger cargoes of precipitation.

The winter is typically the rainy season for California, the time of year when many of the state’s aquifers get recharged with precipitation. But snowmelt that begins in the spring and continues throughout the summer is crucial in refilling aquifers, too, typically providing about 30 percent of the water supply for the state.

The recent storm systems have been the biggest contributor to the snow accumulation in the Sierra Nevada so far this winter. A number of monitoring stations have measured record amounts of snow water equivalent (the amount of liquid water available in snow) for this time of year, reaching seasonal highs usually not seen until late April, when snowpack usually peaks.

On Jan. 17, the recorded snow water equivalent was double what it was last year on the same date, according to data from the California Department of Water Resources.

Storms Build Up California’s Snowpack Average snowpack levels statewide reached seasonal highs usually not seen until April. A chart shows average snow water equivalent levels for each water year from 2003 through Jan. 17, 2023. Levels for Jan. 17 are about double what they were last year on the same date. 45 Previous years since 2003 40 35 This year 30 25 20 15 Last year 10 5 inches Aug. April June Feb. Dec. Oct.

Atmospheric rivers don’t always bring more snow; storms can actually shrink the snowpack if precipitation falls as rain instead of snow at high elevations. That may happen more frequently as the climate continues to warm.

“Snowpack is in pretty good shape right now,” said Rich Tinker, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service and an author on the latest U.S. Drought Monitor report. “But how it melts is going to be important.” Snow melt usually happens in a slow, stable way, but if temperatures rise quickly, that stability can change, he said.

Last year, an unusually wet early winter ultimately gave way to several dry months that led to restrictions on water use in the summer. Research shows that climate warming and unseasonably warm temperatures in the spring and summer have contributed to an earlier thaw season and more rapid melting.

California’s recent spate of storms will not reverse three years that have been the state’s driest on record. It’s taken multiple years to get to the current state of persistent drought, said Gus Goodbody, a hydrologist at the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Water and Climate Center. “It’s going to be hard for a single season to counteract that.”",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,1,0,0,0.963,['United States'],"['San Luis', 'Los Angeles', 'Davis', 'Oroville', 'San Diego', 'Lund', 'San Francisco']"

1339,2023-05-31,"First Drought, Then Flood. Can the West Learn to Live Between Extremes?","Since New Year’s, storm after storm had pummeled the state, dropping epic quantities of water and snow. The water made its way toward the bottom of the valley, as it always had, coursing through waterways held in by earthen levees that, during drought years, grew desiccated and weak, pocked with squirrel burrows. In some parts of the valley bottom, the water wasn’t really contained at all. Deanna Jackson, the executive director of the local agency that manages groundwater in the Tulare Lake Hydrologic Region, described the flooding to me as “vagrant flows, wild flows,” nearly unmanageable water sheeting across the landscape. Houses and farms and dairies flooded, and people were using excavators to hastily build earthen dikes around their properties. Some of these, around houses and small dairies, were a few feet tall; others, around the lands of the largest and richest agriculture companies, were towering and miles-long. Sometimes these fortifications enraged neighbors, whose land the water found instead. In a valley where powerful interests had long jockeyed for access to water, the arguments were now about who would bear the flood.

A few days before, a canal wall along a train track just north of Allensworth, visible from Gonzales’s yard, began to crumble. A froth of brown storm water started to spread toward the houses. Neighbors grabbed shovels and came running; Gonzales and his son brought over the tractors that Gonzales usually uses to muck out paddocks. When they ran out of sandbags, their neighbor Ruben Guerrero, who rushed from work at a nearby elementary school to join the emergency response, had an idea: to fortify the canal wall with the help of a roll of sheet plastic he was planning to use for a house-painting project. The men finally forced the water back with a fix that was part berm, part sand burrito. As the flood pulse receded, they celebrated their victory. But it turned out to be another case of competing interests: The railroad company that owned the land dismantled their work, saying that by protecting their houses, they had threatened the company’s property. So hour by hour, they patrolled the levee, watching the water flow through, quick and deep.

Shortly after, another alert went through town: A different levee, this one along Deer Creek, had given way. Floodwater was again flowing toward Allensworth. First, though, the water surged into a pistachio orchard, where it threatened to uproot trees and drown them in sediment. A video that later went viral captured the farmer’s response: He drove two pickup trucks to the top of the levee, filled their beds with soil to weigh them down and then revved the engines and propelled the trucks straight into the flooded breach where the levee wall used to be. (One, fittingly, was a Chevy.) Heavy equipment and helicopter loads of sandbags from Cal Fire completed the job, but rumors swirled about why the breach had occurred. Jack Mitchell, the head of the local flood-control district, reported that it looked as if a cut had been made with machinery. Had someone intentionally cut the levee, jeopardizing Allensworth, not to mention someone else’s farm, to save his own? “I can’t see how a tree, or a product, a vegetable, is more important than a life,” Guerrero said, shaking his head. “Tomatoes are not the only ones that matter. Our lives matter, too.”

Around town, houses were marked with what looked at first like little streamers but were really bits of caution tape, placed by a swift-water rescue team, as a preparatory measure, to mark which houses were still occupied: red if a house was empty, yellow if it wasn’t. “It’s rare to see red ones,” said Kiara Rendon, an Allensworth resident. Her car was packed with supplies, for herself and the younger siblings she cares for, but she had yet to leave: “A lot of people didn’t evacuate because this is all they have.” A community leader in Allensworth named Denise Kadara told me the same thing. Allensworth was the first town in California to be established by African Americans. It is named for Col. Allen Allensworth, who escaped slavery by fleeing behind Union lines and then joined the Navy before making his way to California. It later became a home for farmworkers and people who couldn’t afford to live elsewhere. Kadara felt certain that if residents had followed the order to evacuate, Allensworth would have been sacrificed to save other places deemed more valuable.

A few days earlier, Rendon came home to find her sister, five months pregnant and alone with a 3-year-old, shoveling mud as water rose in the field behind their house. Rendon took me to see the spot where a crew from Cal Fire helped the family make a small drainage ditch and where water was finally running away from their home. Her gaze kept drifting east, where the other legacy of the storms, a record-setting snowpack, 50 feet in places, glistened white on the distant mountains. All of that water, she knew, would have to find its way to low ground. She didn’t know what would happen then.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,0.0075,[],['Union']

Experts called the drought the worst in decades even before the release of the report, which was conducted by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and released by the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children’s Fund and the Somali government.

The researchers warned that in the first six months of this year, too, between 18,000 and 34,000 people are likely to succumb to the drought.

The new estimates illustrated the grim impact of the drought, which has led to massive displacement, outbreaks of disease and acute malnutrition among children — affecting millions not only in Somalia but also in Kenya and Ethiopia.

“It’s an alarming picture,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies how global warming affects extreme weather events.

Across the region, reservoir levels are near record lows and mountain snowpack, which slowly releases water in the spring and summer, is largely depleted. In California, water restrictions are already in effect, with more widespread cuts expected. Dry soil conditions are already increasing fire risk.

The West is no stranger to drought, but climate change is making it worse. Severe dryness covered California and Nevada just five years ago, from 2012 to 2016, and the Southwest has been in drought for much of the past two decades, punctuated by rare wet years. Experts say this year is unusual because extreme drought conditions are so widespread and have intensified quickly. They are likely to grow even worse this summer.

The situation is especially dire in California and the Southwest.

Winter rain and snowfall usually bring most of California’s moisture for the year, but this winter was drier than usual, with warm temperatures arriving early this spring. The state is now in its dry season and is unlikely to see significant rainfall again until October.

“There’s a 100 percent chance that it gets worse before it gets better,” Dr. Swain said. “We have the whole long, dry summer to get through.”

In the Southwest, a late summer monsoon that usually provides about half of the region’s annual rainfall could bring some respite — if it materializes. Last year, the monsoon was more of a “nonsoon,” bringing only traces of rain.

Low Rains, High Temperatures

Large swaths of the West saw record-low precipitation over the past year, matched by significantly higher-than-usual temperatures.

David Simeral, a climate scientist at the Desert Research Institute and an author for the U.S. Drought Monitor, said conditions over the last 12 months had contributed to the rapid intensification of the current drought. Brutal heat lashed much of the region last summer, the Southwest monsoon failed to deliver substantial rainfall that year, and many western states got less precipitation than usual this winter, too.

While the West has long experienced boom and bust years for precipitation, climate change, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, is increasing volatility: It makes dry years drier and wet years wetter.

Higher temperatures have also directly contributed to the drought conditions and water shortages in recent decades. Warmer winters bring more precipitation in the form of rain rather than snow, decreasing snowpack, and more intense spring heat has caused the snow to melt earlier. Higher-than-usual temperatures also dry out vegetation and soil and can increase evaporation from reservoirs, putting added strain on the crucial Western water supplies.

Natural Resources Conservation Service · For reservoirs in California, recent levels reflect readings on June 8, 2021, compared with average levels for 1966-2015. For all other reservoirs, recent levels are from the end of May 2021 and are relative to the average for the data period of record. For snowpack, available measurements are shown. Recent snowpack levels are compared with the average for the period of record.

Lake Mead, the largest human-made reservoir in the United States, recently hit its lowest level since 1937, following years of decline. The lake, which sits on the border between Nevada and Arizona, is under growing pressure from the prolonged drought, climate change and growing population in the Southwest.

Across the region, reservoirs are struggling this year, especially in California.

Usually, melting mountain snowpack helps to replenish reservoirs, rivers and soils throughout the spring and summer. (You can think of snowpack as a sort of natural reservoir system that releases water over time.)

But in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California and other parts of the lower West, snowpack melted early this year because of higher spring temperatures and other unfavorable conditions. Much of the runoff didn’t make it to reservoirs and streams at all because already-parched soils sucked up the water.

The agricultural sector in California has been particularly affected by water shortages, with federal and state allotments drastically cut. Farmers have had to destroy some water-intensive crops in hopes of saving others. At the California-Oregon border, the drought has pitted farmers against fish once more.

In some parts of the state, local officials have asked residents and businesses to start conserving water. Big cities aren’t likely to see major water shortages this summer, but running out of water is a real possibility for some rural areas, especially those that depend on wells.

Jeanine Jones, the interstate resources manager for the California Department of Water Resources, said the current crisis exposes the need for drought forecasting and planning to consider the effects of climate change.

“We’ve now had two dry years,” she said, but “this is all occurring in the context of a longer period, a couple of decades, of generally dry and much warmer conditions.”

Fire Outlook: ‘As Bad as It Can Be’

Last year, the West Coast saw its worst fire season on record, with megafires burning in Washington, Oregon and California. Dry conditions have set the stage for another bad fire year in 2021.

High temperatures and low precipitation have dried out grasses, shrubs and other greenery, and soils are extremely dry for this time of year.

Already, twice as many acres have burned in California as during the same period last year. The state’s fire season has expanded in recent decades, starting earlier and ending later than it used to.

“Not everything is predictable,” said Dr. Swain of U.C.L.A., referring to events like the dry lightning strikes that ignited many major fires in 2020. “But of the predictable elements — how dry is the soil? And will it get better in the next months? — those are as bad as it can be.”

“Most of the west is at increased risk of large severe fires this year,” he said. “That may sound like a broken record, but maybe that’s the point.”",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,1,-0.9985,['United States'],"['Washington', 'Los Angeles', 'Much', 'Oregon']"

The government has come under pressure from the Biden White House, which is seeking to get all major carbon emitters to commit to ambitious climate change mitigation goals.

Environmentalists in Brazil say the government has weakened its environmental protection agencies in recent years by failing to hire enough personnel, by reducing the number of fines issued for environmental crimes and by supporting industries that are vying for greater access to protected biomes.

Instead of rebuilding the abilities of environmental protection agencies, the Bolsonaro administration outsourced that work to the military, deploying troops to the Amazon in 2019 and 2020. Last week, Vice President Hamilton Mourão announced that the government was starting a new military operation to prevent both illegal deforestation and fires. The initiative is expected to kick off this month and last two months.

The government has promoted the military operations, particularly to international stakeholders, as evidence of its commitment to fight illegal deforestation. But experts say those operations have failed to get to the roots of the problem and have done little to upend the impunity with which miners and loggers operate in protected areas.

In terms of water, “conditions are particularly dire north of Sacramento to the Oregon border, which is driving the crisis on the Klamath River,” Mount said. On the other hand, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and other major cities are in pretty good shape, he added.

Yet California is essentially in the same place the state was in during the third year of the last drought — and this is only Year 2.

When the state’s water reservoirs are drawn down, farmers are forced to turn to groundwater, Mount told my colleague Jill Cowan last month. Until recently, though, the state’s groundwater supplies were not regulated, so they have not had a chance to recharge. The use of groundwater is also unsustainable, bringing with it a cascade of unintended consequences, such as wells drying up.

“It was one of those declarations that the president makes in the morning that is totally off base, but that generates real damage to the economy,” he said, referring to Mr. López Obrador’s vow to end brewing in the north.

It is not certain how the current administration could follow through on the pledge. While the federal water authority is able to revoke the current contracts with the brewers, the move would most likely be met with legal challenges. Instead, industry analysts predicted the comments could mean that the government would refuse to issue future contracts to brewers in the north.

A spokeswoman for the National Water Commission did not respond to a request for comment.

There are signs, however, that the administration is working to soften its stance toward industrial water access.

Panama Canal Drought Slows Cargo Traffic

The lake that allows the Panama Canal to function recorded the lowest water level ever for the start of a dry season this year, which means that vastly fewer ships can pass through the canal. The extreme drought, exacerbated by an ongoing El Niño that is affecting Gatún Lake and the whole region appears likely to last into May.

The Panama Canal Authority has reduced daily traffic through the narrow corridor by nearly 40 percent compared with last year. Many ships have already diverted to longer ocean routes, which increases both costs and carbon emissions, while the global shipping company Maersk recently announced they will shift some of their cargo to rail.

Panama typically sees a dry season from January to May, but climate change has made rainfall patterns much less predictable. The result is that the increasingly severe droughts and extreme deluges can push canal infrastructure past its operational limits. Rising temperatures also evaporate a significant amount of moisture from the reservoir and its watershed.

In previous droughts, weight restrictions were imposed because heavier boats risk running aground in the shallower water. The canal typically handles an estimated 5 percent of seaborne trade, including 46 percent of the container traffic between the East Coast of the United States and Northeast Asia. But last summer, the Panama Canal Authority began taking the drastic measure of reducing traffic. Toll revenues have dropped by $100 million per month since October.

Each maneuver takes around 50 million gallons from its reservoirs to raise and lower vessels through the locks before spilling into the sea.

“The fact that the Panama Canal operates on freshwater is a major disadvantage compared to other water routes,” said Ricaurte Vásquez Morales, the administrator of the Panama Canal Authority, in a video address last month.

“This is certainly a low input year — one of the lowest, one of the driest on record,” said Joshua Tewksbury, the director of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute based in Panama.

But there are two variables when it comes to lake levels: what goes in and what goes out. And demands on water have grown significantly.

Panama’s population has quadrupled since the 1950s, and more than half the country relies on the canal’s reservoirs — Gatún Lake and the smaller Alajuela — for clean drinking water.

“Before it was a very small percentage of total water use, and now it's the equivalent of four or five lockages per day,” said Gloria Arrocha Paz, a meteorologist at the Panama Canal Authority.

Demand for global shipping has risen steadily since the canal first opened in 1914. Cutting through the narrow isthmus saves thousands of miles on trips that might otherwise need to route around the tip of South America or through the Red Sea, where Houthi attacks have thwarted traffic in recent months.

An expansion completed in 2016 added two new locks to accommodate significantly larger “neo-Panamax” ships, which are bigger, heavier and require deeper water to move through the corridor when fully laden. A previous Times investigation found that canal officials ignored warnings that they would need new sources of water in order for the expansion to succeed.

“All of the demands on that water have increased over the last hundred years and none of the inputs have,” said Dr. Tewksbury.

The Panama Canal Authority is also exploring longer term fixes.

The most prominent candidate may be a new reservoir on the Indio River, west of Gatún Lake. But any meaningful next steps will first need to contend with a standing law that prohibits the Panama Canal Authority from constructing reservoirs in watersheds beyond the one that feeds its existing lakes.

The Authority has also looked to Bayano Lake to the east, but tapping it would involve piping the water miles and miles away from a reservoir that also supplies Panama City with hydroelectricity.

Decades of deforestation have degraded the landscape’s potential for absorbing flood waters. The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute has been working with the Panama Canal Authority on forest restoration projects and research into which planting strategies best support the forest’s “sponge effect” to mitigate wet and dry spells, as well as to deliver other climate and ecological benefits.

But it may not be enough to meet the pressing demand for cargo traffic through the Panama Canal. What’s happened this year has emphasized the urgency of obtaining more water sources, said Ms. Arrocha Paz. “Whatever can be done inside the watershed is not going to be enough for the next 50 years.”",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.9473,"['United States', 'Panama']","['Morales', 'Tewksbury', 'Alajuela', 'Panama City']"

The scientists stressed that years of conflict and political instability combined with the challenges of rapid urbanization in the region have limited the ability of local communities to respond to the drought, transforming it into a humanitarian crisis.

In the last three years, the drought, the second worst on record, has shriveled wheat crops and led to tensions between neighboring countries and communities over access to dwindling water supplies. It has also displaced tens of thousands of people, and helped push millions into hunger.

Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe have all declared national emergencies.

It is a bitter foretaste of what a warming climate is projected to bring to a region that’s likely to be acutely affected by climate change, though scientists said on Thursday that the current drought is more driven by the natural weather cycle known as El Niño than by global warming.

Its effects are all the more punishing because in the past few years the region had been hit by cyclones, unusually heavy rains and a widening outbreak of cholera.

It has been well established that both droughts and heat waves have been occurring more frequently in recent decades. And while those conditions can cause damage singly, “their concurrence can be even more devastating,” the authors wrote.

What used to be a rare weather double whammy has been occurring more frequently in recent decades because of climate change, said Mojtaba Sadegh, an assistant professor of civil engineering at Boise State University and an author of the new study, published Wednesday in Science Advances. “These events, dry-hot events, are intensifying,” he said. “This is rising at an alarming rate.”

Here’s What Worries Me Most About Drought.,"Outside my lab near Donner Pass in the Sierra Nevada of California, new animal tracks are on the snow after a winter of hibernation, bird songs are lofting through the air, and the creek is flowing strongly with water from the melting snow. Spring has come worryingly early to the Sierra Nevada.

This past week, I joined teams of other scientists gathering the most important measurements of the Sierra Nevada snowpack from over 265 sites throughout the state. Typically, this measurement marks the transition from snow accumulation season to the melt season and contains the most snow of any measurement throughout the year. The 2022 results, however, confirmed what those of us monitoring the state’s drought had feared: California’s snowpack is now at 39 percent of its average, or 23 percent lower than at the same point last year. This signals a deepening of the drought — already the worst in the western United States in 1,200 years — and another potentially catastrophic fire season for much of the West.

Many people have a rather simplistic view of drought as a lack of rain and snow. That’s accurate — to an extent. What it doesn’t account for is human activity and climate change that are now dramatically affecting the available water and its management. As more frequent and large wildfires and extended dry periods batter the land, our most important tools for managing water are becoming less and less accurate. At the same time, our reliance on these models to try to make the most of the little water we have is becoming more and more problematic.

Droughts may last for several years or even over a decade, with varying degrees of severity. During these types of extended droughts, soil can become so dry that it soaks up all new water, which reduces runoff to streams and reservoirs. Soil can also become so dry that the surface becomes hard and repels water, which can cause rainwater to pour off the land quickly and cause flooding. This means we no longer can rely on relatively short periods of rain or snow to completely relieve drought conditions the way we did with past droughts.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.9114,['United States'],['Spring']

The “genius of the system,” he said, is that it slows down the water flow from the mountains to the plains in order to better retain and distribute it.

Without acequias, snowmelt from mountain peaks would flow directly into rivers and lakes that dry up during the summer. With them, the melt is diverted to multiple acequias winding through the hills. The water soaks into the ground in a “sponge effect,” and then circulates slowly through aquifers and shows up months later, downslope, in springs that irrigate crops during the dry season.

Severe deluges have occurred frequently in Britain in the past decade and a half, with particularly dramatic floods in 2000, 2007 and 2012.

“What we saw in 2012, after a severe drought, was a lot of flooding and quicker runoff into rivers,” said Ms. Coxon. “If we see significant amounts of rainfall in the autumn, falling on very dry and compacted soils, that will certainly lead to an increased risk of flooding.”

The study was published in the journal Nature Climate Change.

Chris Boulton, a researcher at the University of Exeter and the study’s lead author, said that the Amazon was like a giant water recycling network, as moisture from evaporation and transpiration from trees is blown by winds. So the loss of some of the forest, and some of the moisture, leads to more drying elsewhere.

“You can imagine that as the Amazon dries you start to see that resilience being lost even faster and faster,” Dr. Boulton said. Forests might then decline and die off relatively quickly and become more like a savanna, with grasses and far fewer trees.

Not only would the loss of forest trees add the carbon stored in their tissues back into the atmosphere, savannas would also take up far less carbon than the large, broad-leafed trees they replaced. Savanna habitat would also support far fewer species.

Dr. Nobre said the research shows that the Amazon “is on the edge of this cliff, this switch to a different ecosystem.” And if it were to happen, he added, “that would be the new ecosystem for hundreds of years, perhaps thousands of years.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,0.4792,[],['Exeter']

Some people think of rainforests as faraway places that have little to do with their day-to-day existence. But millions of people live in cities and settlements throughout the Amazon. Many endure precarious conditions and become sources of cheap labor. The forest is sometimes destroyed in their name, with the justification that it develops and improves the economy. In Brazil, deforestation rates are breaking records. And if we continue to destroy the forest, we can expect dire consequences — not just for the region, but for the planet.

Over the past 50 years, human intervention has been increasingly disrupting the ecological balance of the Amazon. Climate change has led to an increase in temperatures of 1.5 degrees Celsius across the basin, and to more frequent severe droughts. The droughts of 2005, 2010 and 2015-16 were among the worst in more than 100 years. Since 1980, there’s been an increase in the duration of dry seasons by three to four weeks in the more degraded areas of the Amazon.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,-0.9301,['Brazil'],[]

And the long-range forecast is for above-average precipitation through October, as weather patterns send remnants of tropical storms toward the Northeast. The Atlantic hurricane season will be “above normal,” with as many as 20 named storms, 10 of which could develop into hurricanes, federal scientists said last week.

But right now, with there is “moderate drought” in parts of the city, as reported by the National Drought Mitigation Center, which tracks climate conditions. The center said last week that 45.5 percent of Manhattan was so dry it was in the “moderate drought” category, the second of five that range as high as “exceptional drought.” The rest of Manhattan was “abnormally dry,” the lowest category.

Brooklyn and Staten Island were listed as “moderate drought,” with nothing classified as “abnormally dry.” Just under 80 percent of Queens fell into the “moderate drought” category, with the rest “abnormally dry.” About three-quarters of the Bronx was abnormally dry; the rest was listed as “moderate drought.”

The city said that drought is less of a concern than it once was because conservation efforts since the 1990s have cut water use by a third, even though the population grew by about 1.5 million people in that time. The city is now using about 1 billion gallons a day, roughly 500 million gallons less than then. Low-flow toilets and shower heads have made a difference. So have timers on the spray showers on playgrounds.

The idea of taking water from one community and giving it to another has some basis in American history. In 1913, Los Angeles opened an aqueduct to carry water from Owens Valley, 230 miles north of the city, to sustain its growth.

But the project, in addition to costing some $23 million at the time, greatly upset Owens Valley residents, who so resented losing their water that they took to dynamiting the aqueduct. Repeatedly.

Today, there are some enormous water projects in the United States, though building a pipeline that spanned a significant stretch of the country would be astronomically more difficult. The distance between Albuquerque, for example, and the Mississippi River — perhaps the closest hypothetical starting point for such a pipeline — is about 1,000 miles, crossing at least three states along the way. Moving that water all the way to Los Angeles would mean piping it at least 1,800 miles across five states.

So the engineering and permitting challenges alone would be daunting. And that’s assuming the local and state governments that would have to give up their water would be willing to do so.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,-0.8719,['United States'],"['Los Angeles', 'Albuquerque', 'Carol']"

Sichuan Province in west-central China, one of China’s most populous and a fast-growing industrial base in recent years, normally generates more than three-quarters of its electricity from huge dams. The summer rainy season usually brings so much water that Sichuan sends much of its hydropower to cities and provinces as far away as Shanghai.

But an almost complete failure of summer rains this year, coupled with daytime highs that have regularly approached or exceeded 100 degrees Fahrenheit, has left rivers and reservoirs with fractions of their former water. The large province’s many dams cannot generate enough electricity even for Sichuan’s own needs, forcing factories there to close for up to a week at a time.

As troubles accumulate in the Chinese economy, the country’s central bank announced on Monday that it was cutting its five-year interest rate by 0.15 percentage points, to 4.3 percent, in a move that might bring a little relief to the country’s huge construction and real estate sector.

Drought emergencies have been declared. Farmers and ranchers are suffering. States are facing water cutbacks. Large wildfires burned earlier than usual with more major fires burning in Arizona, New Mexico and other states.

There appears to be little relief in sight.

What is a drought, exactly?

There are no precise parameters that define a drought, but it is generally understood to mean a period of abnormally dry weather that goes on for long enough to have an impact on water supplies, farming, livestock operations, energy production and other activities.

A drought usually starts with less-than-normal precipitation (and what is normal varies from region to region). If the dryness persists, river flows and reservoir and groundwater levels start to decline. Warm temperatures have an impact, too, causing winter snowpack to melt faster, which can affect the availability of water throughout the year. Excessive heat also causes more evaporation from soils and vegetation, which can lead to crop failures and increases the risk of severe wildfires.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,natural disaster,0,0,0,-0.8942,"['United States', 'Mexico']",['Much']

1392,2024-08-08,Heat Waves and Droughts Are a Bonanza for Junk Food Companies,"It’s easy to understand why poor communities can come to rely on ultraprocessed foods. In the Sundarbans, a large mangrove forest in India and Bangladesh, geographers have documented how rising sea levels, changes in rainfall and more intense cyclones have devastated fishing and traditional agriculture. Parents who are forced to leave to find work then send their children pocket money to buy food, which they often use to buy packaged snacks and drinks, one of the few sources of comfort or pleasure they can afford.

Thanks to climate change, fresh foods are often hard to find, and even when you can find them, without water, it’s difficult to cook them, making packaged and fast foods more enticing. Higher temperatures also make fresh food spoil faster.

Powdered drink mixes, canned soups or granola bars may seem like the ideal solution: They contain preservatives to prevent spoilage, and unlike locally produced food, they’re made by large, multinational companies that can source ingredients from around the world. In Southeast Asia, people have told me they think packaged foods are healthy precisely because they are less likely to go bad. This can create a strong affinity that is tough to break.

The food industry has rushed to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by climate change. During heat waves, companies often unleash a relentless barrage of advertisements on television, billboards and online, many of them for sugary drinks and junk food. In the Netherlands, McDonald’s created a heat-sensitive billboard that dispensed free McFlurry vouchers when the heat broke 101.48 degrees Fahrenheit, or 38.6 Celsius. In India, during the extreme heat wave earlier this year, ice cream companies created new flavors and started selling them online to boost sales. In Bangladesh, ads showed people surrounded by orange blazes, sweating. “No matter how hot it is,” one tagline read, “just stay cool with Sprite!” In other countries such as Australia and Mexico, research has found a link between heat and soft drink and alcohol intake.

When a natural disaster strikes, many of these food companies are on hand to deliver emergency food aid.

As the state’s residents are discovering, the two opposite meteorological conditions can combine to make for severe mudslides.

In a prolonged drought, soils dry out, harden and become less permeable to water, said Dan Shugar, a geoscientist at the University of Calgary in Canada. When heavy rain falls on soil like that, less of the water soaks in.

“Any gardener who has forgotten to water their flower patch during a heat wave has firsthand experience of this,” Dr. Shugar said.

Water can pond quickly on the hardened soil, and, depending on the terrain, will eventually run off. On steep slopes, the water rushing downhill can accelerate, eroding soil in its path, picking up rocks and debris and joining with other rivulets of water to make a growing and potentially destructive mudslide.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,natural disaster,0,0,0,-0.6124,['Canada'],['Calgary']

The recent onslaught of precipitation has flooded highways, broken levees and knocked out power for tens of thousands of utility customers, inflicting widespread destruction on Californians still weary from the back-to-back atmospheric river storms that pummeled the state in January.

The deluges have also had another effect: replenishing reservoirs and building up snowpack, which has improved drought conditions across much of the state. This week, the U.S. Drought Monitor noted “broad reductions in drought coverage and intensity” across California and neighboring areas.

But long-term concerns remain in a state where years of aridity, rising temperatures and unsustainable water use have left their mark, experts say.

“The water issues haven’t gone away,” said Jay Lund, vice director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis, “they’re just taking more of a backseat.”

Cycles of deluge and drought are common in California, in both the long and short term. The state typically gets the bulk of its precipitation during the late fall and winter, much of it from storms fueled by atmospheric rivers, and can go long periods in the spring and summer without any rain.

California has built up its water infrastructure — reservoirs, wells and irrigation systems — in part to account for the imbalanced timing in precipitation. But the strategy of capturing water during wet periods and reserving it for dry periods gets more difficult to implement in a warming climate, Dr. Lund said, because weather extremes are becoming greater.

The recent storms have quickly refilled many of California’s reservoirs. A number of them have returned to or even surpassed average levels for this time of year, compared with previous years where reservoir levels remained below the historical average. (Reservoirs are usually maintained below their full capacity, sometimes with controlled releases to mitigate flood risk.)

A Sharp Turn for California’s Reservoirs Some reservoir levels have neared or surpassed their historical averages. Charts show levels for California’s Shasta, Oroville and Pine Flat reservoirs (and the Pyramid reservoir if viewed on desktop) from the beginning of 2022 through March 12, 2023. Previously low, water levels have spiked this winter, nearing or surpassing historical averages, though they remain below full capacity.

A warmer climate has intensified California’s “weather whiplash,” the rapid swings between dry and wet spells, leading to both longer, more intense droughts and stronger storms.

Because warmer air can carry more moisture, atmospheric rivers — essentially long plumes of water vapor — will be able to deliver larger cargoes of precipitation. That precipitation can come in the form of rain, or, when temperatures are below freezing, snow.

This winter, record amounts of snow have blanketed California’s Sierra Nevada, leaving some local residents stranded on the roads and in their homes. According to data from the California Department of Water Resources, average snowpack levels statewide were more than three times as high this week as they were at the same time in each of the last three years.

Record Snowpack Across California Average snowpack levels statewide are the highest in decades. A line chart shows average snow water equivalent levels for each water year from 2004 through March 12, 2023, with levels for this year and the water years 2020 through 2022 highlighted.

Snowpack is a crucial piece of the state’s water system. Rains recharge the state’s reservoirs in winter, but snow melt helps preserve their levels in the spring and summer, typically providing about 30 percent of the water supply for the state.

That process is most effective if snow melt happens in a slow, stable way, said Rich Tinker, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service and an author on the U.S. Drought Monitor reports. But, quickly-warming temperatures can disrupt that rhythm, he said.

Research shows that unusually warm temperatures in the spring and summer have already contributed to an earlier thaw season and more rapid melting. California’s historic snowpack this year, coupled with increased soil moisture, “is heightening the potential for spring floods,” said Ed Clark, director of N.O.A.A.’s National Water Center, in a press release.

Some experts say that California missed an opportunity after January’s heavy rains to capture floodwaters and replenish underground aquifers. Last week, the state’s water regulators approved a plan to divert more than 600,000 acre-feet of floodwaters from the San Joaquin River and reroute much of it to areas where it could spread out and percolate down, recharging groundwater.

California’s aquifers can hold vastly more water than all of the state’s major reservoirs combined, but they have been depleted by decades of heavy pumping, especially in agricultural regions like the Central Valley.

Groundwater stock is harder to measure in real time than snowpack and reservoir levels. But data suggests that, over the past two decades, groundwater supplies in the Central Valley have decreased precipitously during dry periods and recovered only modestly during wet ones.

“It’s sort of like if you are deep in debt,” said Alex Hall, the director of the Center for Climate Science at U.C.L.A.

Do you live in a state that is experiencing drought? If so, how is it affecting you, your family and your community? What would you like others to know? What’s missing from the news coverage you have read, heard or seen?

If your state is not in the middle of a drought, have you experienced extreme weather such as wildfires, heat waves, hurricanes, floods or anything else where you live? If so, what was it like? How has it affected your life and the lives of those in your community?

How do you feel about the increase in frequency of extreme weather around the world and the intensifying effects of climate change? Is this something you discuss with your classmates, friends or parents? Why or why not?

What questions do you still have about climate change and its impact on your community and the world?

If you are interested in joining a conversation with other teenagers about extreme weather conditions and climate change, please share your thoughts in the comments section of our related Student Opinion question. You can also read what other students have posted and respond to them. Did you learn anything from others’ responses that you didn’t already know?

Option 2: Learn more about the human impact of the megadrought.

The intense drought is affecting people and communities across America. For example, in New Mexico, farmers along the Rio Grande have been urged not to plant this year; the level of Lake Mead, the huge reservoir on the Colorado River, is so low that Arizona, Nevada and other states will most likely face cutbacks in supplies; and in North Dakota, ranchers are trucking water and supplemental feed for their livestock because the rangelands are so dry and the vegetation is stunted.

Choose one of the recent articles from The Times below to learn more about the human impact of the extreme drought. Then, respond to the following prompts in writing or through discussion with a partner or small group: What new information did you learn about the drought and how it is affecting people and communities? What was most interesting, surprising or memorable? What questions do you still have?

Option 3: Inform others.

Using the information you learned in the warm-up activity and the featured article, create something to help educate others about the drought in the American West. Here are some options:",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,1,0.9493,['Mexico'],"['Rio Grande', 'Santa Barbara']"

And it is exposing the enormous challenges involved in hosting the island’s semiconductor industry, which is an increasingly indispensable node in the global supply chains for smartphones, cars and other keystones of modern life.

Chip makers use lots of water to clean their factories and wafers, the thin slices of silicon that make up the basis of the chips, Raymond Zhong and Amy Chang Chien report for The New York Times.

1400,2023-01-20,What Will ‘Weather Whiplash’ Mean for California?,"California is built upon the great gamble of irrigation. Left alone, much of the land in the Western United States would be inhospitable to teeming cities. But we’re Americans — we couldn’t let the desert stand in our way.

More than a century ago, the United States Bureau of Land Reclamation began taming the water in the West. It’s been a remarkably successful project. In California, where I live, irrigation has turned largely barren regions into some the country’s most fertile farmland and most prosperous metropolises. We’ve built “the most ambitious desert civilization the world has seen,” Marc Reisner put it in “Cadillac Desert,” his 1986 history of Western irrigation.

I’ve been thinking a lot about “Cadillac Desert” in the past few weeks, as the rain fell and fell and kept falling over California, much of which, despite the pouring heavens, seems likely to remain in the grip of a severe drought. Reisner anticipated this moment. He worried that the West’s success with irrigation could be a mirage — that it took water for granted and didn’t appreciate the precariousness of our capacity to control it.

“Everything depends on the manipulation of water — on capturing it behind dams, storing it, and rerouting it in concrete rivers over distances of hundreds of miles,” he wrote. “Were it not for a century and a half of messianic effort toward that end, the West as we know it would not exist.”",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,0.9712,['United States'],[]
1401,2023-03-14,How Can We Measure Droughts and Deluges? Weigh the Planet.,"Scientists have long cautioned that warming temperatures would lead to wetter and drier global extremes — increasingly severe rainfall, more intense droughts. A new study shows where that may already be happening.

Note: Multi-year events are assigned to the year with peak intensity.

The study provides an emerging picture of distortions in the total amount of water both above ground and also in aquifers deep beneath the Earth’s surface, where most of the freshwater that humans depend upon comes from.

It relies on data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment mission, known as Grace, which uses satellites that can detect changes in gravity to measure fluctuations in water where other satellites can’t see. That way, it can provide information about locations where there are otherwise no gauges or wells.

“For most of the world, we just don’t have data on how groundwater storage is changing,” Matthew Rodell, the deputy director of earth sciences at NASA Goddard, said. “Grace sort of breaks those boundaries and provides information everywhere.”

In a paper published Monday in the journal Nature Water, Dr. Rodell and Bailing Li, an assistant research scientist at the University of Maryland, analyzed the satellite data to measure water-cycle extremes. They uncovered 505 wet and 551 dry episodes between 2002 and 2021, then assigned each one an “intensity,” in order to rank them. The intensity rankings took into account the severity of an episode as well as its duration and the amount of land area affected.

Dr. Rodell and Dr. Li initially set out to rank the worst droughts and periods of increased rainfall over the past 20 years of available satellite observations. When reviewing the results, however, they soon realized both types of events were more common — and were growing more severe — toward the end of the study period.

To see if global warming could be behind the changes, the researchers compared the correlation of monthly wet and dry intensities with global average temperatures and other known climate factors.

They found that global average temperatures had a more significant correlation than the other indicators, including El Niño, the occasional shift in Pacific Ocean water temperatures that can have significant effects on heat and precipitation. The finding strengthens the possibility that, as the world warms, we’ll see more frequent and stronger extremes.

A few regions stood out. The tropics are experiencing more intense wet spells, and continental regions are seeing a trend toward drought.

However, 20 years of observations is short in terms of climate time scales. Simply looking for correlations like this “is going to be limited in its ability to tease these things apart. It’s not trivial to do,” said John Fasullo, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who wasn’t involved in the study.

There are other limitations to the Grace data. Global measurements are monthly and are published with a delay, making it impractical for tracking events as they unfold. The data also has an effective resolution about the size of the state of Illinois, which isn’t ideal for seeing changes on a more local level.

The analysis also excludes regions known to be undergoing long-term human impacts or persistent ice melt that were identified in a previous study led by Dr. Rodell. They include California’s Central Valley, where agricultural use has depleted aquifers, and Greenland, where the ice sheet has melted.

Groundwater changes, particularly at the extremes, remains a topic in need of further study, especially to analyze the influence of global warming. But for precipitation over shorter time periods, the relationship is more clear. “One of the robustly detected aspects of water cycle extremes is the increase of intense precipitation with climate change,” said Dr. Fasullo.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,1,2,0.9928,"['Canada', 'Russian Federation', 'Greenland', 'Brazil', 'Australia']","['Maryland', 'Much']"

The crisis is striking for a country that was seemingly blessed with bountiful fresh water, and that appeared to be ahead of the climate change curve, as The Times Magazine reported last year. But the three-year drought brought the country to its knees.

Water stress is a major concern all over the globe. A similar crisis is happening now in parts of Iran, and you may remember the 2018 drought in Cape Town, and another one in São Paulo, Brazil, in 2015.

Climate change didn’t directly cause the drought in Uruguay and neighboring Argentina, as we reported last year.

1404,2023-01-07,California Could Capture Its Destructive Floodwaters to Fight Drought,"Graham Fogg, a professor emeritus of hydrogeology at the University of California, Davis, who has studied California’s water systems for 40 years, has a long-held dream: to find a dozen or more paleo valleys and use them to replenish groundwater depleted by over-pumping and controlling rivers with levees and dams. For decades, few people were listening. But lately, that’s beginning to change. He and his colleague Rosemary Knight of Stanford University have convinced the state’s Department of Water Resources to undertake a three-year survey to find more of them.

The big hope is that an array of paleo valleys could be turned into giant storm drains to quickly absorb heavy rain. Storm water spread over the valleys would sink underground and then move into the surrounding clays and silts, for more than 12 miles on either side of the valley and for hundreds of feet in depth, according to one study. It would raise the diminished water table, which is important because a healthier underground water system can feed rivers from below and allow people to continue to pump water from wells. It can also make more water available to plants and soil, help to sustain the rain cycle and reduce fire risk.

There is enough unmanaged surface water from rain and snow statewide to resupply Central Valley aquifers, making more water available to farmers, urban dwellers and the environment. Even with climate change, the state will most likely have enough water for recharge in the future in part because of more extreme weather, according to a 2021 study.

To use paleo valleys to store these big rains, the land above them must be conserved for groundwater recharge. And that’s already a challenge: One paleo valley found outside of Sacramento has been slated for housing developments, which would cover it with impermeable concrete and asphalt. Such decisions are typically governed by city and county governments, but the state could incentivize areas with paleo valleys to protect the land above them.

Land use isn’t the only issue. The state’s major aqueducts that move water from north to south can also play a big role in helping floodwater reach the paleo valleys. The aqueducts are underused in winter when fewer growers need to irrigate their crops and could transport excess storm water to depleted aquifers. Pipes could be added to them to move the water to the paleo valleys.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,scientific report,0,0,0,0.969,[],"['Sacramento', 'Davis']"

1407,2021-09-16,Climate Scientists Forecast High Temperatures Into the Fall,"After a summer of blistering heat across much of the country, the hotter-than-normal conditions that have contributed to severe drought across the West are forecast to continue into the fall, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday.

Five states had their warmest June through August in 127 years of record-keeping. Not coincidentally, two of those states — California and Oregon — experienced some of the largest fires in their history, as the high temperatures contributed to extra-dry soils and vegetation that helped fires spread quickly.

Scott Handel, a meteorologist with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said during a news conference that the forecast for October called for above-normal temperatures across much of the country, with only the Pacific Northwest and the Gulf States likely to have near-average temperatures.

If that holds, the withering drought that currently ranges from the West Coast through the Southwest, the Rockies, the Northern Plains and into Central Minnesota will likely expand eastward.

1408,2020-04-13,China Limited the Mekong’s Flow. Other Countries Suffered a Drought.,"“There was just a huge volume of water that was being held back in China,” Mr. Basist added.

The Mekong is one of the most fertile rivers on earth, nurturing tens of millions of people with its nutrient rich waters and fisheries. But a series of dams, mostly in China, have robbed the river’s riches.

Those who depend on its inland fisheries say their catches have declined precipitously. Persistent droughts and sudden floods have buffeted farmers.

Beijing’s control of the upstream Mekong, which provides as much as 70 percent of the downstream water in the dry season, has raised hackles, even though the Southeast Asian nations depend on trade with China. While the Chinese government has introduced a global development program that it says will benefit poorer trading partners, a backlash is growing among countries that feel they are losing out.

“The problem is that the Chinese elite see water as something for their use, not as a shared commodity,” said Brian Eyler, director of the Stimson Center’s Southeast Asia program and author of “Last Days of the Mighty Mekong.”",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,0.4303,['China'],['Beijing']

Water authorities in Marin County, Calif., which is contending with the lowest rainfall in 140 years, are considering whether to stop allowing new water hookups to homes.

Developers in a dry stretch of desert sprawl between Phoenix and Tucson must prove they have access to 100 years’ of water to get approvals to build new homes. But extensive groundwater pumping — mostly for agriculture — has left the area with little water for future development.

Many developers see a need to find new sources of water. “Water will be and should be — as it relates to our arid Southwest — the limiting factor on growth,” said Spencer Kamps, the vice president of legislative affairs for the Home Builders Association of Central Arizona. “If you can’t secure water supply, obviously development shouldn’t happen.”

Late last month, the state water department announced that it would not approve any applications for developers seeking to use groundwater within the area. The decision has raised concerns from local developers, who said the restrictions would make it harder to meet the needs of Arizona’s voracious housing market.

In Utah, Oakley and the nearby farming town of Henefer are vowing not to grow until they can secure new, reliable sources of water through drilling or pumping — an expensive and uncertain prospect.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,-0.2263,[],"['Oakley', 'Tucson', 'Phoenix']"

Fewer passages could deprive Panama’s government of tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue, push up the cost of shipping and increase greenhouse gas emissions when ships travel longer routes.

Though Panama has an equatorial climate that makes it one of the wettest countries, rainfall there has been 30 percent below average this year, causing water levels to plunge in the lakes that feed the canal and its mighty locks. The immediate cause is the El Niño climate phenomenon, which initially causes hotter and drier weather in Panama, but scientists believe that climate change may be prolonging dry spells and raising temperatures in the region.

Before the water problems, as many as 38 ships a day moved through the canal, which was built by the United States and remained under its control until 2000. The canal authority in July cut the average to 32 vessels, and this week announced new limits that are likely to lead to fewer than 30 passages a day.

The latest find as water levels fall: dinosaur tracks in Texas.

Severe drought conditions at Dinosaur Valley State Park, about 60 miles southwest of Fort Worth, exposed dinosaur tracks from around 113 million years ago that were previously hidden underneath the Paluxy River, according to Stephanie Garcia, a spokeswoman for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The tracks, which were discovered this month, belong to Acrocanthosaurus, which are theropods, or bipedal dinosaurs with three toes and claws on each limb.

The dinosaur would have stood 15 feet tall and weighed close to seven tons as an adult. They would have left their tracks in sediment that hardened into what is now limestone, researchers say.

“Due to the excessive drought conditions this past summer, the river dried up completely in most locations, allowing for more tracks to be uncovered here in the park,” Ms. Garcia said in a statement. “Under normal river conditions, these newer tracks are under water and are commonly filled in with sediment, making them buried and not as visible.”",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,natural disaster,0,0,0,-0.891,['Spain'],"['Fort Worth', 'Texas', 'Las Vegas']"

The Mississippi typically nears its lowest levels in the fall, but the drop has been more intense this year after a particularly dry summer in the Midwest, which failed to replenish the tributaries feeding into the river. Its withered state has also allowed saltwater to push in from the Gulf of Mexico, threatening the drinking water supply for Louisiana communities that draw from the river.

Last month, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers installed a barrier made of sediment that stretches across the riverbed and serves as a speed bump of sorts, stalling the intrusion of saltwater that, under normal conditions, would be impeded by the river’s downstream flow. The corps is also dredging to prevent more barges from becoming stuck. In addition, the authority that manages the Tennessee River system announced that it would open two dams, although experts said it would provide only a modest influx into the Mississippi.

Not a drop of rain fell in downtown San Francisco this February. Or in Big Sur State Park. Or in Paso Robles. February in California was so dry that it is raising concerns that the state, which, according to the National Drought Mitigation Center, only fully emerged from drought last March, may be headed for another one.

“It was the driest February on record,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Ordinarily, 90 percent of California’s rain falls during the seven-month period between Oct. 1 and April 30, with half of the state’s total precipitation falling during December, January and February. The rains that come in February are part of a seasonal pattern that nourishes plants, replenishes reservoirs and, in the Sierra Nevada mountains, restores the snowpack that provides up to 30 percent of the state’s drinking water.

But this February “was not just merely a below average month,” Dr. Swain said. “It was, in a lot of places, a completely dry month, which is truly extraordinary.”

The lack of snow and rain in February comes after a January that was also drier than average, and a record dry autumn for much of Northern California. A series of storms dumped a considerable amount of snow in late December, raising hopes that this winter might proceed normally. But that now seems less likely.

“There’s sort of this myth of the miracle March in California, which refers to a couple of specific years in which the winter was extremely dry and then March came along and there was just this unceasing deluge for a few weeks in a row,” Dr. Swain said.

In those years, the rainfall erased a large part of the water deficit. But this year has been so dry that the state would need record breaking rain and snow in the next few months to make up for the shortfall.

The United States Drought Monitor, a joint project by federal agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Agriculture, releases drought maps weekly. They currently show much of the state as either abnormally dry or in moderate drought.

As of March 1, according to the California Department of Water Resources, the state’s snowpack was 44 percent of normal. In the Southern Sierras, the percentage was only 40 percent.

The state had a very dry winter and a dry autumn, too.

The lack of moisture is coming at a time when the state needs more water, not less. January and February weren’t just unusually dry, they were also unusually warm. On Feb. 27, for example, the temperature at the Los Angeles International Airport hit 85 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 29 Celsius, breaking a record of 83 degrees Fahrenheit that was set in 1992.

“In recent weeks there have actually been a number of days with spring or even summer-like temperatures in the 70s and 80s throughout a lot of California, which were daily record high temperatures for a portion of February,” Dr. Swain said.

The hotter temperatures, which are associated with climate change, dry out soil, making moisture less available to plants and increasing wildfire risk. The state has already seen an uptick in reported fires, according to The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CalFire, which responds to reports of wildfires.

Between Jan. 1 and March 1, the agency has “responded to 381 of those calls already,” Scott McLean, Cal Fire’s deputy chief of communications, said. Last year over the same time period, it responded to 105 reports. Over the past five years, the average number of wildfire reports during the first two months of the year was 279 calls, putting this year at roughly 35 percent above average.

It is too soon to tell what this will mean once summer hits, “but this is a group effort by everybody in the state of California to be prepared,” Mr. McLean said. The department is educating residents on fire risk, including maintaining space around their properties that firefighters can use to defend against fire, and sending out firefighters to reduce dead brush or overgrown plants that could easily ignite, as well as preparing firefighting equipment.

But increasingly, those preparations may need to take the long view. There’s growing evidence that, in a warming world, the state’s overall levels of precipitation won’t decline but the distribution of precipitation will change. That is: the drier years will be drier, and the wetter years will be wetter and the state will need to find ways to cope.

“Portions of California have experienced both their driest years on record and their wettest years on record in the past 10 years,” Dr. Swain said.

And California is not the only state in the region facing these sorts of issues. The United States Drought Monitor is also showing that much of Oregon, Washington State and Nevada are also currently experiencing abnormally dry conditions.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,1,0,0,-0.011,['United States'],"['Paso Robles', 'Los Angeles', 'Santa Barbara', 'San Diego', 'McLean', 'San Francisco', 'Oregon']"

Re “Wildfire Risk Only Growing for Northeast” (front page, Nov. 21):

This article leaves the impression that the drought in the Northeast this fall, which drove record wildfires, was caused by human-driven climate change due to a general increase in extreme events. This, however, does not appear to be the case for this drought.

The cause was a lack of precipitation for two months related to a persistent high pressure center over the Central or Eastern U.S. the whole time. I have studied droughts for decades, and to me this appears to be coming about from random atmospheric circulation variability — basically an unfortunate run of weather.

The Northeast has actually been getting wetter for decades now and especially in the fall. This dry period appears as a shocking drop in precipitation amid a trend to wetter conditions. Climate models also predict that the Northeast should be getting more precipitation, not less, as a consequence of rising greenhouse gases.

It is true that climate warming will dry the leaves, soils and vegetation, and that has likely played a role in this fall’s fires. However, there is no evidence based on observations or models that dry falls like this are becoming more common because of climate change.

We might also be changing the climate in an even bigger way.

For the past two decades, scientists have been raising alarms about great systems in the natural world that warming, caused by carbon emissions, might be pushing toward collapse. These systems are so vast that they can stay somewhat in balance even as temperatures rise. But only to a point.

Once we warm the planet beyond certain levels, this balance might be lost, scientists say. The effects would be sweeping and hard to reverse. Not like the turning of a dial, but the flipping of a switch. One that wouldn’t be easily flipped back.

SWITCH TO °C

When corals go ghostly white, they aren’t necessarily dead, and their reefs aren’t necessarily gone forever. Too much heat in the water causes the corals to expel the symbiotic algae living inside their tissues. If conditions improve, they can survive this bleaching. In time, the reefs can bounce back. As the world gets warmer, though, occasional bleaching is becoming regular bleaching. Mild bleaching is becoming severe bleaching.

Scientists’ latest predictions are grim. Even if humanity moves swiftly to rein in global warming, 70 percent to 90 percent of today’s reef-building corals could die in the coming decades. If we don’t, the toll could be 99 percent or more. A reef can look healthy right up until its corals start bleaching and dying. Eventually, it is a graveyard.

This doesn’t necessarily mean reef-building corals will go extinct. Hardier ones might endure in pockets. But the vibrant ecosystems these creatures support will be unrecognizable. There is no bouncing back anytime soon, not in the places corals live today, not at any scale.

When it might happen: It could already be underway.

In the ground beneath the world’s cold places, the accumulated remains of long-dead plants and animals contain a lot of carbon, roughly twice the amount that’s currently in the atmosphere. As heat, wildfires and rains thaw and destabilize the frozen ground, microbes get to work, converting this carbon into carbon dioxide and methane. These greenhouse gasses worsen the heat and the fire and the rain, which intensifies the thawing.

Like many of these vast, self-propelling shifts in our climate, permafrost thaw is complicated to predict. Large areas have already come unfrozen, in Western Canada, in Alaska, in Siberia. But how quickly the rest of it might defrost, how much that would add to global warming, how much of the carbon might stay trapped down there because the thawing causes new vegetation to sprout up on top of it — all of that is tricky to pin down.

“Because these things are very uncertain, there’s a bias toward not talking about it or dismissing the possibility, even,” said Tapio Schneider, a climate scientist at the California Institute of Technology. “That, I think, is a mistake,” he said. “It’s still important to explore the risks, even if the probability of occurrence in the near future is relatively small.”

The colossal ice sheets that blanket Earth’s poles aren’t melting the way an ice cube melts. Because of their sheer bigness and geometric complexity, a host of factors shapes how quickly the ice sheds its bulk and adds to the rising oceans. Among these factors, scientists are particularly concerned about ones that could start feeding on themselves, causing the melting to accelerate in a way that would be very hard to stop.

In Greenland, the issue is elevation. As the surface of the ice loses height, more of it sits at a balmier altitude, exposed to warmer air. That makes it melt even faster.

Scientists know, from geological evidence, that large parts of Greenland have been ice-free before. They also know that the consequences of another great melt could reverberate worldwide, affecting ocean currents and rainfall down into the tropics and beyond.

When it might happen: Irreversible melting could begin this century and unfold over hundreds, even thousands, of years.

Breakup of West Antarctic Ice

At the other end of the world from Greenland, the ice of western Antarctica is threatened less by warm air than by warm water.

Many West Antarctic glaciers flow out to sea, which means their undersides are exposed to constant bathing by ocean currents. As the water warms, these floating ice shelves melt and weaken from below, particularly where they sit on the seafloor. Like a dancer holding a difficult pose, the shelf starts to lose its footing. With less floating ice to hold it back, more ice from the continent’s interior would slide into the ocean. Eventually, the ice at the water’s edge might fail to support its own weight and crack into pieces.

The West Antarctic ice sheet has probably collapsed before, in Earth’s deep past. How close today’s ice is to suffering the same fate is something scientists are still trying to figure out.

“If you think about the future of the world’s coastlines, 50 percent of the story is going to be the melt of Antarctica,” said David Holland, a New York University scientist who studies polar regions. And yet, he said, when it comes to understanding how the continent’s ice might break apart, “we are at Day Zero.”

When it might happen: As in Greenland, the ice sheet could begin to recede irreversibly in this century.

Sudden Shift in the West African Monsoon

Around 15,000 years ago, the Sahara started turning green. It began when small shifts in Earth’s orbit caused North Africa to be sunnier each summer. This warmed the land, causing the winds to shift and draw in more moist air from over the Atlantic. The moisture fell as monsoon rain, which fed grasses and filled lakes, some as large as the Caspian Sea. Animals flourished: elephants, giraffes, ancestral cattle. So did humans, as engravings and rock paintings from the era attest. Only about 5,000 years ago did the region transform back into the harsh desert we know today.

Scientists now understand that the Sahara has flipped several times over the ages between arid and humid, between barren and temperate. They are less sure about how, and whether, the West African monsoon might shift or intensify in response to today’s warming. (Despite its name, the region’s monsoon unleashes rain over parts of East Africa as well.)

Whatever happens will matter hugely to an area of the world where many people’s nutrition and livelihoods depend on the skies.

When it might happen: Hard to predict.

Loss of Amazon Rainforest

Besides being home to hundreds of Indigenous communities, millions of animal and plant species and 400 billion trees; besides containing untold numbers of other living things that have yet to be discovered, named and described; and besides storing an abundance of carbon that might otherwise be warming the planet, the Amazon rainforest plays another big role. It is a living, churning, breathing engine of weather.

The combined exhalations of all those trees give rise to clouds fat with moisture. When this moisture falls, it helps keep the region lush and forested.

Now, though, ranchers and farmers are clearing the trees, and global warming is worsening wildfires and droughts. Scientists worry that once too much more of the forest is gone, this rain machine could break down, causing the rest of the forest to wither and degrade into grassy savanna.

By 2050, as much as half of today’s Amazon forest could be at risk of undergoing this kind of degradation, researchers recently estimated.

When it might happen: Will depend on how rapidly people clear, or protect, the remaining forest.

Sweeping across the Atlantic Ocean, from the western coasts of Africa, round through the Caribbean and up toward Europe before heading down again, a colossal loop of seawater sets temperatures and rainfall for a big part of the globe. Saltier, denser water sinks to the ocean depths while fresher, lighter water rises, keeping this conveyor belt turning.

Now, though, Greenland’s melting ice is upsetting this balance by infusing the North Atlantic with immense new flows of freshwater. Scientists fear that if the motor slows too much, it could stall, upending weather patterns for billions of people in Europe and the tropics.

Scientists have already seen signs of a slowdown in these currents, which go by an unwieldy name: the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC. The hard part is predicting when a slowdown might become a shutdown. At the moment, our data and records are just too limited, said Niklas Boers, a climate scientist at the Technical University of Munich and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

Already, though, we know enough to be sure about one thing, Dr. Boers said. “With every gram of additional CO2 in the atmosphere, we are increasing the likelihood of tipping events,” he said. “The longer we wait” to slash emissions, he said, “the farther we go into dangerous territory.”

1429,2024-07-30,Fine Dining Can’t Go On Like This,"In the new age of chronic drought, chefs will need to adapt. But the transition to a less water-intensive diet need not spell the end of culinary invention. What is required is a reimagining of the types of foods that make for a nourishing and energetic culinary culture — and this is where California, with its sunny history of agriculture and hospitality, can play a leading role. The Golden State won’t have to do it alone. Australia, uncommonly parched and grappling with similar ecological challenges, has already shown how to create excitement about drought-tolerant foods.

Much of California’s mythos is tied to its status as a land of abundance. Over the past 50 years, a new generation of chefs (including Ms. Waters, Mr. Keller, Wolfgang Puck, Dominique Crenn and Nancy Silverton) pioneered a different approach to cooking and eating. The farm-to-table movement, locavorism and the transition to organic produce all owe a debt, in one way or another, to California chefs. And the culturally omnivorous cooking that today spills from the state’s most acclaimed kitchens — all those zhugs and pastrami-jeweled breakfast burritos — is a celebration of California’s bounty and of culinary borrowings.

California’s agricultural sector explicitly positions itself as the guardian of this maximalism. Californian farms feed not only Californians. They supply a good portion of the rest of the country and world, too. California is America’s top producer of almonds, artichokes, carrots, garlic, onions, lettuce, grapes, pistachios and peppers, among other crops. In total, the state’s farmers and ranchers received $55.9 billion for their activities in 2022.

Agriculture is also the thirstiest sector of the state’s economy, accounting for around 80 percent of water used for businesses and homes. And while a significant portion goes to crops such as alfalfa that are used to feed animals, many of the fruits, vegetable and tree nut crops that California farmers plant also require a lot of water. As you might have heard, almonds and pistachios are among the worst offenders, requiring an average of four feet in depth of water per acre of irrigated land. But they’re not alone; apricots, pears, plums and walnuts require more than three feet, on average.

Policies that regulate groundwater use have a significant role to play, but chefs have a unique cultural power to mold consumption habits, and they can help push farmers to switch to less thirsty crops. Restaurants have driven the postwar expansion of popular taste: The kiwis, kales, radishes and radicchios now commonplace in American supermarkets were once highly exotic and difficult to find, but they became popular in part thanks to chefs who opened the public’s eyes to the possibilities of a more adventurous produce basket. Farmers will always respond to the market, but demand follows fashion — and this is where chefs can exert influence.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,not disaster,0,0,0,0.9849,['Australia'],"['Much', 'Keller']"
1430,2024-07-29,What to Eat on a Burning Planet,"This election season, many Americans are deeply distraught about the cost of food. You hear their frustrations in polls, at rallies and in focus groups — sticker shock is one of the few issues left to unite Americans across the political spectrum. But as painful as foodflation is, it may just be an early ripple of the kind of disruption to the food system that’s coming. The scale of these changes will be breathtaking. Their global consequences will be profound. And for most of us, they will change what’s in our refrigerators and on our kitchen tables.

Already, we can see the early tremors starting to rattle the global food system. As climate change permanently alters weather patterns, farmers are struggling to produce crops in the same huge volumes they once did. In California this month’s heat wave turned lettuce yellow. In Vietnam extreme heat has damaged the coffee crop, sending prices worldwide soaring. Consumers will soon see even higher prices and less of the foods they have come to know and love. Like it or not, our produce aisles are on the brink of transformation.

At the same time, agriculture itself is putting greater and greater pressure on the environment and the climate. Though the organic and plant-based food movements have helped shift production and consumption patterns ever so slightly, we remain dependent on a largely unsustainable food system that’s destroying precious resources as it races to feed the world.

A few countries are sensing that they have to innovate: Brazil has an industrial farm that produces record yields with regenerative farming practices.

1431,2024-07-11,Thinking About a Mississippi River Cruise? There’s One Big ‘If.’,"Tom Trovato and his wife, Trish, paid more than $20,000 and waited two years to experience Viking’s inaugural cruise up the Mississippi River. Leaving in September 2022, it was supposed be a two-week excursion from New Orleans to St. Paul, Minn., a trip of some 1,800 miles.

They never got past Memphis.

Low water levels, caused by drought, narrowed the river’s main shipping channel to allow only one-way traffic, first stalling their boat, the Viking Mississippi, and then ultimately aborting the trip.

Though they got a full refund, the Trovatos, who live in Surprise, Ariz., have no plans to try again.

“If I live to be 125, it might be on my bucket list,” said Mr. Trovato, 79.

The Mississippi River is central to American identity, with all the contradictions that entails. It’s an artery that sustained Indigenous cultures for thousands of years — “Mississippi” derives from the Ojibwe for “great river” — and it marked the frontier from which Lewis and Clark set out to find a route to the Pacific. The river’s alluvial deposits and deep waters formed the basis of prosperity for generations of farmers, and brought perdition to vast numbers of enslaved people who toiled along its banks and feared little more than being “sold down the river.”",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,-0.8519,[],"['Surprise', 'Memphis', 'New Orleans']"
1432,2021-06-24,"Once Again, the Earth Is Being Wrung Dry","The way we manage our water is outdated, inefficient, uncoordinated and, to a lot of people, unfair. There is little national leadership. Even though the federal government pays for maintaining large infrastructure projects like dams, Congress has given states the primary responsibility to manage water supplies, leading to epic legal wars over water between states and a back-seat role for the federal government when droughts strike. At all levels of government, our response tends to be reactive; presidents and governors offer grand proposals to fight droughts while we’re in the thick of them, with little long-term planning for water crises long before they happen. Perhaps most important, as a society, we spend nothing close to the amount of money we need to manage a resource as precious as water. Water in the United States is provided by about 50,000 community water systems, many of them small and privately owned and lacking much capacity to prepare for the coming era of worsening drought.

The good news is that even if we cannot stop drought, we are not powerless before it. Experts foresee technologies that would allow for greater conservation and reuse; among these are smart irrigation systems that can water plants far more efficiently, expanded operations to recycle dirty water for new uses, and even grand breakthroughs like much cheaper desalination. The complexities in mitigating drought are less about innovation and more about determination — a collective will to recognize that the way we manage water now is not working and that we need big fixes.

And we need them urgently. Nobody is shocked that the West is dry again. The climatological record suggests the Western United States has long been prone to long periods of severe aridity. Some droughts in the region have lasted centuries; indeed, the last few hundred years, the period encompassing all of U.S. history, may have been an unusually wet exception to the desiccated norm.

For scientists who study drought, then, the surprise is not that the dry season has returned but that it has come on so soon and has accelerated so quickly. Between 2012 and 2016, California experienced the most severe drought in a millennium. Scientists and policymakers described it as a wake-up call — a stark preview of the aridity to come under a warming climate.

In the era of extreme weather, it’s crucial to know how to ease that pain. That’s what I wanted to better understand. So I reached out to Abdi and Ray.

Somini: Ray, is this drought in Somalia connected to climate change? Scientists tell me that, partly because of the conflict, there’s just not enough rainfall data over a long enough period to make that determination.

Ray: There has been no clear direction of change in the occurrence of drought in the Horn of Africa since the 1950s, according to the latest and best research reviewed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

But scientists expect the frequency, duration and intensity of droughts in the region to increase if global warming reaches higher levels. The warmer atmosphere would mean the land gets drier and stays drier. There would be bigger swings in rainfall. So even if this drought wasn’t made more likely or more intense by global warming, future ones might easily be.

Somini: Lisa Thalheimer, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton who studies the compounding effects of drought and conflict in Somalia, told me that, even when there’s rain, the ability of the soil to absorb moisture has been “eradicated.” In effect, she said, it’s very hard for either the soil or the people to bounce back after long, successive droughts.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,0.9382,['Somalia'],['Princeton']

Dry conditions also shrivel crops, harm livestock and worsen wildfires.

But droughts, even long ones, eventually end, when the natural variability of climate results in a few “good,” meaning wet, years in a row. So after a relatively cool and wet spring last year followed by a decent snowpack in the fall and winter, there was some optimism that 2020 might be remembered as the year the long Southwestern drought started to fade.

But then came April and May, which were warm and dry, leading to rapid melting and runoff.

Normally, Dr. Sexstone said, measurements of stream flow at gauges in the region would slowly climb to a peak and then drop off gradually as the season progressed.

“This year it seemed like it peaked and then plummeted,” he said.

Becky Bolinger, a drought specialist at Colorado State University and the assistant state climatologist, said the lack of new snow in late spring affected the rate of melting. As snow is exposed to the sun it warms and nears the melting point. If new snow falls, that lowers the temperature, stalling the process. But without any new snow, the melting continues unimpeded.

“When you turn the heat on early in spring and shut off the snow altogether, that allows that snowpack to melt at an extremely fast rate,” she said.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,scientific report,0,0,1,0.5647,[],"['Rio Grande', 'Colorado']"

The smaller northern cities like Mendocino, Fort Bragg and Ukiah are in wetter climates and accustomed to relying on a plentiful supply of water from a single source.

The reticence of the I.P.C., which is controlled by United Nations bodies and major relief agencies, is not unusual: It has declared a famine only twice in the past decade, in Somalia in 2011 and South Sudan in 2017. The “F-word,” as aid workers archly call it, retains an emotive resonance, able to galvanize global attention and, crucially, to unlock vast amounts of donations. It should be used in only the most extreme situations, the thinking goes.

But Somalia has already plunged deep into that worst-case scenario, according to aid workers, doctors and diplomats who say they are confounded by the I.P.C.’s latest assessment, or believe its methodology is flawed.

The twin crises of food insecurity and climate change are on the agenda at a summit meeting of American and African leaders that starts in Washington on Tuesday.

By the I.P.C.’s own estimates, the number of acutely malnourished Somalis has more than doubled since January to 5.6 million, of whom 214,000 are already in famine-like conditions. How many have died is unknown, but the number is rising rapidly. The World Health Organization will publish its first estimate of drought-related deaths in the coming weeks, a spokeswoman said.

Others say human influence is having a big effect, but maybe not the way you’d think.

A growing number of researchers see influence from pollution — in large part, the atmospheric sulfur pollution that rose sharply during the postwar industrial boom and declined after environmental legislation like the Clean Air Act. Under this theory, the sulfur pollution inhibited the formation of storms by cooling the region. When the air got cleaner, storm activity went up.

And a recent paper in the journal Science makes the case that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation doesn’t really exist. (Notably, the lead author on the paper, Michael E. Mann of Pennsylvania State University, was the one who originally coined the ungainly term.)

So can you trust science?

Absolutely. Jill Trepanier, an associate professor of geology at Louisiana State University, told me that Dr. Mann’s reversal serves as an excellent example of scientific progress. “That’s the way the science game is played, truly a lot of it is being right for a while and then realizing you’ve been wrong and having to adjust,” she said. “What is true today might not be true tomorrow.”

Dr. Mann, who developed the 1998 “hockey stick” graph, which shows the powerful effects of greenhouse gas emissions on global warming, said that he was happy to be able to correct his own work about the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. “Scientists must always be open to revising past thinking,” he said.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,not disaster,0,0,0,0.9906,[],[]

sabrina tavernise

From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise. And this is “The Daily.” [MUSIC PLAYING] 40 million people in seven states in the Western US depend on water provided by the Colorado River. After 20 years of drought, that river has reached a breaking point. And those seven states were supposed to come up with a deal to cut their use of that water by today. My colleague, Christopher Flavelle, explains why the federal government may now have to step in and make an agonizing choice. It’s Tuesday, January 31. Chris, we know the water situation in the West is pretty bad. But you’ve reported now that the problem and that the effort to solve the problem has come to a crisis point. So tell me about that. What’s going on?

christopher flavelle

So the US has had a drought in the West since 2000. And that’s meant a lot of things, but one of them is that the Colorado River, which provides water to about 40 million people in seven states, is drying up. Those states are Arizona, Nevada, California, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. Its annual flow is decreasing precipitously. But now for years, states and the federal government have tried to cut the use of that water. But it hasn’t worked. They haven’t cut enough. And so last year, as those levels got really low, officials said, we have to do more. So last summer, the federal government said, we want these seven states to find a deal to cut their total water use by 2 to 4 million acre feet. That’s about 20 percent to 40 percent of the total flow of the river. It’s just an astonishing amount of water.

sabrina tavernise

20 percent to 40 percent of the flow of the river?

christopher flavelle

Right. It’s almost inconceivable.

sabrina tavernise

Wow.

christopher flavelle

But the government said, we’ve got no choice. The situation is so dire. You, the states, have to make this cut. Please come to an agreement. They gave them a deadline of two months. The states blew that deadline. There was no deal. So last fall, the government again said, really, states, we need you to come to a deal to make significant cuts. And the deadline for that second round was today, Tuesday.

sabrina tavernise

Oh wow.

christopher flavelle

And I spent the last few weeks talking to negotiators from the states. And they all tell me the same thing. It is extremely unlikely that they’re going to reach a deal to make the magnitude of cuts the government wants.

sabrina tavernise

And what exactly would happen if they don’t reduce their water usage, Chris? I mean, what’s the actual problem that they’re trying to solve?

christopher flavelle

In a word, it’s dead pool. And dead pool is coming up fast.

sabrina tavernise

Dead pool? OK, what’s dead pool?

archived recording 1 Large, man-mad reservoirs, like Lake Mead, could become a dead pool. archived recording 2 Dead pool. archived recording 3 Dead pool is when Mead gets low enough to crash the whole Colorado system. archived recording 4 I am genuinely worried about the possibility of this system hitting dead pool. archived recording 5 You are? archived recording 4 Absolutely, I am.

christopher flavelle

So let’s take a step back and remember at the center of this Colorado River system is two man-made lakes, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, both created by erecting enormous dams. The lakes are for drinking water reservoirs. They also provide hydropower and flood control. They’re crucial to the system. And there’s two sorts of red lines that we’re approaching as the drought gets worse. The first red line is if the water level in these two lakes gets low enough, these dams can’t produce power anymore. That’s a pretty significant hit for this region. It’s not the end of the world. These aren’t the only sources of power. But it’s a big problem. The next red line is way worse. The next red line you get to is dead pool. In dead pool, there’s not enough water in these lakes for any water to pass through the dams. And what that means is these downstream states — California, Arizona, Nevada — they’re losing what are in some cases their main source of drinking water and their main source of irrigation water. So —

sabrina tavernise

Oh wow.

christopher flavelle

— as bad as no power is, no water at all passing through these dams is almost catastrophic for the lower half of this basin. And that’s the one point everyone agrees on, the federal government and the seven states. Everybody wants to avoid dead pool. But the question is, how do they do it? [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

So how close are we to this nightmare scenario you’re describing?

christopher flavelle

Well, when you physically look at the lakes, you can tell right away how incredibly low they are.

archived recording 6 Wow, this lake is so shallow right now.

christopher flavelle

You can see the sides of the basins where there’s this so-called bathtub ring, areas that used to be wet and are now bone dry.

archived recording 7 We were able to see handfuls of previously sunken boats that used to be at the bottom of the lake. And now they’re just sitting completely dry on the shore.

christopher flavelle

You can see exposed parts of the lake bed.

archived recording 8 As the lake level recedes, secrets emerge —

christopher flavelle

You can see in some places things that used to be buried, like old boats. Even in some cases —

archived recording 8 — like a body found in what’s left of a metal barrel.

christopher flavelle

— bodies that have turned up.

archived recording 9 Four bodies have been discovered as the lake dries up.

christopher flavelle

But the scary thing here is that no one really knows with much certainty when dead pool could arrive. And the reason no one really knows is for a long time, there was a fairly predictable relationship between how much snow fell in the mountains and how much of that water reached the river through snow melt. What’s happened recently is that relationship is broken down. So what I heard from sources is that last year, there was almost average snowpack but well below average stream flows. The year before that, also almost average snowpack, but only about a third of average flows. So if you lose that relationship, that connection between how much snow falls and how much water flows to the streams into the river, it becomes really hard to predict how fast the system dries up. So that’s probably the worst place to be, where you lose your ability to predict just how fast these systems could disappear.

sabrina tavernise

So you’re saying that it could happen any time, basically. We don’t really know what the timing of this is?

christopher flavelle

Yeah. And, look, it doesn’t seem like anyone thinks this could happen tomorrow and probably won’t happen this year, but definitely a concern for the year after and the year after that. But really, the point to underline is all the models that used to inform how much water would be in these lakes are breaking down because of climate change, because the pattern of precipitation is changing, the temperature in the air is changing. So we no longer have as solid a grasp about how much time we have. So the government has to not just work on really tight timelines, but also acknowledge we can’t be sure of anything anymore. And so everyone’s trying to move as fast as they can in case we have even less time than we think.

sabrina tavernise

So the states are told they have to come to some agreement, right on reducing their water usage but they can’t seem to do it. Why can’t they come to an agreement?

christopher flavelle

The answer to that question starts 100 years ago. Back in 1922, the states argued over and finally agreed on how to apportion the water from the Colorado River. They knew even then that the Colorado is the key to their survival in terms of human habitation, irrigation, building cities. And that deal from 1922, called the Colorado River Compact, has really held together over the last century. And it remains the foundation of how they interact. But the problem is that deal was really based on a fiction. Even at the time, the amount of water that was assumed to be running through the river every year was rarely as high as it thought it was going to be. And because of population growth and now climate change, there’s more and more pressure. So the actual water flow through that river keeps getting farther and farther below the number that holds up this whole deal.

sabrina tavernise

So, Chris, they just miscalculated from the beginning?

christopher flavelle

You could say they miscalculated. You could say it was wishful thinking. But whatever the cause, the number that underlay this whole deal, 17.5 million acre feet of water every year, was just wrong.

sabrina tavernise

Oh man.

christopher flavelle

Most years over the last century, it’s been below that. And the last 20 years, it’s been dangerously below that. And that number keeps on shrinking almost every year. So really, what’s happening here is a deal that was never really quite based on fact is colliding with the reality of climate change.

sabrina tavernise

Yeah, interesting. Interesting. So basically, all this development in the West — the growth of agriculture in Southern California, the growth of cities like Phoenix — was all based on a flawed assumption that there would be way more water than there ever actually was.

christopher flavelle

That’s right. And the consequences of that flawed assumption just grew over time because based on those assumptions, cities emerged and got bigger. Communities got bigger. Farmers planted more crops. So the demand on that river grew. And at the same time, especially in the last 20 years, the supply of water has shrunk even more dramatically because of the drought and the effect of climate change. So this deal, this foundational agreement is under pressure from both sides, more demands and less water. And last year and this year are really the point where it becomes obvious to everyone, it’s just untenable.

sabrina tavernise

So what exactly are these states arguing? I mean, what does the fight look like?

christopher flavelle

Well, there’s two basic groups, upper basin and lower basin. Let’s start with the upper basin. The upper basin are four states — Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. They’re kind of a group. What makes them a group is that they are all upstream of these two reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead. So the important thing with the upstream states is they don’t rely on giant reservoirs to just pull their water from. They are sort of dependent on whatever the stream flow is. And as the snow melts in the Rocky Mountains has gone down, the amount of water reaching these states has dropped precipitously. I’m told they’re getting about half as much as their actual allotment —

sabrina tavernise

Oh wow.

christopher flavelle

— is the amount of actual water reaching the mostly farmers’ fields in these states.

sabrina tavernise

Amazing.

christopher flavelle

So their argument is, don’t look to us. We’re already at half of our paper rights for water. So how can you ask us to go much lower? We can’t be the solution.

sabrina tavernise

Right. We’re already down by half. So no way, not us.

christopher flavelle

Exactly. And so that just leaves the three lower basin states, which are Nevada, Arizona, and California. And Nevada’s pretty straightforward. They already get almost no water. They have an allotment of 300,000 acre feet. It’s a sliver in the pie. Even if you just cut off Nevada entirely, it wouldn’t get the government that much closer to its goal. And Nevada says, well, hang on. We’re already doing a lot anyway to reduce our water use. The state even passed a law last year outlawing some kinds of grass lawns. So their argument is, don’t look to us.

sabrina tavernise

Right.

christopher flavelle

So that leaves just two states, Arizona and California, which happen to be the two states that actually use the most water. And they’ve got something else in common, which is both states say more cuts should come from the other state.

sabrina tavernise

[LAUGHS]: OK.

christopher flavelle

But what makes those two states really interesting is they have just fundamentally different arguments and different philosophies about how this should be decided. So what looks at first glance like a battle between states is really a battle between two competing ideas. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. OK, Chris, so this big question about how to reduce the water use of the Colorado River is, as you just laid out for us, basically coming down to a dispute between California on the one side and Arizona on the other. And you said they had two really different approaches. So what are these approaches? Tell me about them.

christopher flavelle

So let’s start with California. And we should say it’s the southern part of the state that’s getting this water. It’s Los Angeles and San Diego. And most of all, it’s farmers in the Imperial Valley and other parts of the southern part of the state, this sort of breadbasket of America. And Southern California is making what boils down to a legal argument. The way the laws of the river work is that different users have different priorities based on how long they’ve been using the water. And California, Southern California has really the most senior rights in the system. Before California gets cut, others, in particular Arizona, are supposed to get cut first. So California says, look, our legal basis is strong. We don’t have to take these cuts. They should go to somebody else first. And only once Arizona goes dry do you come to us. Now, it’s not their only argument. California also says that because they produce so much of the vegetables and even hay for cows around the country, if California were to be meaningfully cut, you would have a food crisis. But their main argument is on the law. And everyone I talked to for this story said that on the law itself, California’s mostly right. That’s not the dispute. The dispute is how much will that argument count for against Arizona’s case.

sabrina tavernise

So what’s Arizona’s case?

christopher flavelle

Arizona makes a very different argument. And the negotiators I spoke with conceded that their legal argument isn’t that strong. But, they say, they’ve got different arguments. The main one is what’s practical? And what’s fair? They say that most of the farmers in Arizona who rely on this water have already suffered and lost a lot of that water. It really comes down to this point to cities, Phoenix and Tucson, and also tribes. A significant number of Native American tribes are along these canals in Arizona. And they would be hurt, too. So Arizona says, sure, on the law maybe you can cut us first. But in reality, it makes no sense. You would be causing significant health harms to these cities. And the government would be violating its obligations to tribes that have been promised this water through treaties. So Arizona’s argument boils down to, don’t just look at the law. Look at what makes sense. And if you look at what makes sense, you cannot cut us that deep because people would suffer too much.

sabrina tavernise

I mean, Arizona is basically saying to California, we’re talking about people and drinking water and being able to bathe. I mean, this is more important than some cabbages or some almond farms.

christopher flavelle

Yeah, and it’s a really compelling argument. But at the same time, California has what seems like a compelling argument, which is was it a good idea in the first place for Arizona to build these cities in the desert that rely on a supply of water whose legal foundation was never that solid, right? And I think the intractability of these negotiations really comes down to the fact that both sides have good arguments. But they’re good in different ways. And nobody is quite willing to agree to a deal that imposes really severe harm on their own constituents. And I don’t know how you get around that dynamic.

sabrina tavernise

So what are they going to do? What happens now?

christopher flavelle

So the federal government, having failed last summer to get states to make a deal, tried again. And in November, they said to the states, all right, here’s what’s going to happen. We’re going to start a process to study the effects of significantly cutting water use from the Colorado. And we want you to give us a plan that we can study because if we don’t have a plan from you, we’ll just make a plan of our own. And that will be what happens because there’s a ticking clock here. The government has to have a plan in place that’s been studied by the summer, which is when evaporation is highest. Temperatures are highest.

sabrina tavernise

Right, the threat of dead pool is looming.

christopher flavelle

That’s right. The threat of dead pool is highest because these lakes will shrink even more. So this isn’t some arbitrary timeline. The government has said to states, if you want to be involved in this and have us study your plan, give it to us by the end of January. And that’s the deadline the states now seem unable to meet. So now the federal government has to find a plan of its own because it won’t have a plan from the states. And the federal government is concerned that if there isn’t a plan the states have agreed on, that sets up a very real risk that whatever the government does gets mired in legal fights, which could slow down the whole process and make it harder to act with the urgency that’s required.

sabrina tavernise

Like a delay that they can’t really afford?

christopher flavelle

Yeah. So we don’t know yet how these cuts will actually be distributed. But it’s a pretty safe bet that it’s going to be some combination of the following. Probably some portion of farmers in California won’t have water to irrigate their crops. They’ll have to fallow their fields. Number two, cities in Arizona and, quite possibly, in Southern California will have to be even more aggressive and innovative and rushed about using less water, becoming more efficient, and ripping up more lawns. Tribes in Arizona in particular will see their access to water go down. These are communities that will suffer a lot if they lose access to water. So this pain is going to be spread around. But the question that I think everyone is asking is, will the pain be so great in any one area that it’s just unbearable? And in some cases, the states are going to decide that they can’t bear it and they need to find new sources of water, whether it’s recycling, desalination, maybe even bringing water in from somewhere else through pipelines. So this isn’t the end of the story. This is going to prompt a whole new wave of aggressive, risky, maybe not quite feasible strategies to try and get more water. So really, we’re back to where we were 100 years ago. They’ve got to figure out where to get more water.

sabrina tavernise

Right. Back then, the West looked around and saw a landscape that was mostly desert but decided not to accept that reality and instead decided to do these really dramatic things to change that reality. And you’re saying they might do that again?

christopher flavelle

That’s right. Anyone who’s been to this part of the country knows there is an almost magnetic draw, an almost unearthly beauty that this part of the country has. And people can’t get enough of it. And just like 100 years ago, they’ll do whatever they can to make it livable and to grow there, even as the cost of that growth gets harder and harder to bear. And the only question is, when will they try next?

sabrina tavernise

Chris, thank you.

1455,2023-11-07,Here’s Where Wildfires Are Burning Across the Southern U.S.,"Wildfires caused by drought, warmer-than-normal temperatures and, in a few cases, possibly arson have been ablaze for days in several Southern states. The threat has led officials to enact burn bans and to stop issuing safe-burn permits.

November is the peak month of the fire season across the country, but certain areas, including parts of the Southeast, are expected to be at an “above-normal” risk, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Mississippi, for example, was one of eight states that reported large fires to the National Fire Service on Friday. Drought and below-normal precipitation have been some of the contributing factors, according to the center.

1456,2022-10-10,"They’re ‘World Champions’ of Banishing Water. Now, the Dutch Need to Keep It.","Gertjan Zwolsman, a policy adviser and researcher at Dunea, a drinking-water company that supplies 1.3 million people around The Hague, and his colleagues are exploring methods for pumping up and treating the brackish water beneath the Netherlands’ sandy coastal dunes. The process is energy intensive. But so is transporting river water across great distances to cities, said Franca Kramer, a researcher at Dunea.

“There is nothing natural about the Netherlands,” Dr. Zwolsman said, laughing.

So far, the country’s adaptations to drought haven’t involved anything as grand as its massive storm barriers or other flood-control projects. But if the planet becomes much hotter — in the coming decades, it is projected to be more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) warmer than it was in preindustrial times, even if nations deliver on their climate pledges — then Dutch leaders might need to consider bolder, and potentially riskier, steps.

One concerns the fate of Rotterdam, Europe’s largest port. Today, the city has an open channel to the North Sea so cargo ships can move in and out easily. But the channel also lets seawater in, forcing the Dutch government to send huge amounts of fresh water down the rivers to push it back.

As sea levels rise, “you’re going to need more and more water to keep that sea out,” said Niko Wanders, a water expert at Utrecht University. At some point, he said, the government might want to close off the Port of Rotterdam with locks, as it has done with the Port of Amsterdam. This would hinder shipping traffic but free up water for other purposes. (It wouldn’t solve the problem completely: During this summer’s drought, the Dutch government restricted how often the locks near Amsterdam could be opened each day to limit saltwater intrusion.)

Some have floated an even more drastic solution: a gigantic new sea dike that walls off much of the Dutch coast. It wouldn’t be cheap. But the alternative, which could cost even more, is to keep adapting and re-adapting water infrastructure for progressively tougher conditions, said Stefan Nieuwenhuis, a senior adviser for the Dutch water ministry.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,scientific report,0,0,0,0.9833,['Netherlands'],"['The Hague', 'Amsterdam', 'Rotterdam']"

Heavy downpours caused devastating flash floods in central Tennessee, tearing apart houses and killing more than 20 people. Yet, California and much of the West remained in the most widespread drought in at least two decades, the product of a long-term precipitation shortfall and temperatures that are much hotter than usual.

This divide, a wetter East and a drier West, reflects a broader pattern observed in the United States in recent decades. Similar patterns can be seen worldwide: On average, global land areas have seen more precipitation since 1950. But even as much of the world has become wetter, some regions have become drier.

It’s not yet clear whether these changes are a permanent feature of our warming climate, or whether they reflect long-term weather variability. But they are largely consistent with predictions from climate models, which expect to see more precipitation overall as the world warms, with big regional differences.

1458,2021-08-30,A New Breed of Crisis: War and Warming Collide in Afghanistan,"Parts of Afghanistan have warmed twice as much as the global average. Spring rains have declined, most worryingly in some of the country’s most important farmland. Droughts are more frequent in vast swaths of the country, including a punishing dry spell now in the north and west, the second in three years.

Afghanistan embodies a new breed of international crisis, where the hazards of war collide with the hazards of climate change, creating a nightmarish feedback loop that punishes some of the world’s most vulnerable people and destroys their countries’ ability to cope.

And while it would be facile to attribute the conflict in Afghanistan to climate change, the effects of warming act as what military analysts call threat multipliers, amplifying conflicts over water, putting people out of work in a nation whose people largely live off agriculture, while the conflict itself consumes attention and resources.

“The war has exacerbated climate change impacts. For 10 years, over 50 percent of the national budget goes to the war,” Noor Ahmad Akhundzadah, a professor of hydrology at Kabul University, said by phone on Thursday. “Now there is no government, and the future is unclear.

And the benefits of this once-in-a-lifetime winter are everywhere. Melting snow that continues to fill reservoirs will allow the state to fill 100 percent of water requests for the first time in nearly two decades. That means that 27 million Californians and 750,000 acres of farmland that have been allocated only some or, in some cases, none of their requested water will now have all of it, according to the California Department of Water Resources. It’s the first time since 2006 that this has been possible.

Even with the spring snowmelt, much of the snowpack is expected to last into July or, in some instances, even into August or September, which will help keep Sierra Nevada forests moist and the fire danger lower. Rivers are rising and, while a bit too intense at times, will make for great rafting, kayaking and fishing. For those who don’t want to leave winter behind, several ski resorts are staying open well into the summer. Pockets of flooding have left some stranded and many buildings damaged, but the likelihood of severe events is decreasing as each day passes with normal melt conditions.

Of course, our water woes are not over. The long-term drying of the Southwest continues, and precipitation patterns are shifting in a changing climate. Eventually drought will return — likely sooner than later — and we need to continue developing solutions to low precipitation years.

But this year still feels like a reward. Rather than solely prepare for the upcoming natural disaster season of fire and drought, we get to anticipate a summer when flowing rivers and deep lakes will be full of people enjoying them. If only for one year, abundant, clear and cold waters will come down from the Sierra Nevada.

It’s the latest evidence of how climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels is imperiling food, water and electricity supplies around the world.

The main driver of this year’s droughts was searing heat throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere, the researchers reported in a new study. Such high average temperatures, over such a large area, would have been “virtually impossible” without the influence of greenhouse gas emissions, the scientists said.

Across the Northern Hemisphere north of the tropics, soil conditions as parched as they were this summer now have a roughly 1-in-20 chance of occurring each year, the scientists found. Global warming increased this likelihood, they said, but cautioned that because of the challenges involved in estimating soil moisture at a global scale, the exact size of the increase had a wide possible range.

“In many of these countries and regions, we are clearly, according to the science, already seeing the fingerprints of climate change,” said Maarten van Aalst, the director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center and one of 21 researchers who prepared the new study as part of the World Weather Attribution initiative, a research collaboration that specializes in rapid analysis of extreme weather events.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,0.891,['China'],['Aalst']
1464,2022-07-20,This 500-Year-Old Tree in California Has a Story to Tell,"By Daniel Griffin

Graphics by Nathaniel Lash Daniel Griffin is an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota where he studies climate and ecosystem change — past and present — through data collected from tree rings.

About two hours north of Los Angeles, on the steep slopes of Mount Pinos, stands an ancient grove of big-cone Douglas fir trees. The telltale signs of decades-long droughts from centuries past lie deep within the trunks of its oldest trees. But inscribed just beneath the bark are traces of the worst drought these trees have ever withstood.

Across California, primeval forests are under threat. Pests are decimating the state’s bristlecone pines, the oldest trees on Earth. Two wildfires in September killed thousands of mature sequoias (the world’s largest trees by volume), a fate similar to large areas of coastal redwood forests (the world’s tallest) the year before. Last week, the Washburn Fire scorched the flank of the Mariposa Grove, a group of over 500 giant sequoias whose protection was a driving force for the creation of Yosemite National Park.

The rings inside the Douglas firs in the Mount Pinos grove record a continuous climate history stretching back 500 years, nearly five times as far as rain-gauge records. But even though these trees are well adapted to this rugged landscape, they cannot survive without sufficient rainfall and moisture. For some of the trees, their unbroken story may be coming to an end.

Under high magnification, we can make out the cells that mark the earliest days of this tree’s life. When the rains came in the spring of 1539, the young tree grew rapidly, forming large cells that tree scientists call “earlywood.” As summer came to an end, the tree slowed down. It grew smaller, tightly packed cells called “latewood” that marked the change of season as it prepared to go dormant in the fall and winter. It repeated the process season after season. Wide and light, dark and dense — each cycle indicating a year. Some years, it saw plentiful rain. Those years are marked with thick rings, the tree growing faster and for longer than in other years. Some years were harder. A drought began in 1571. In this core sample, a ring of wood from that year never had a chance to grow. A decade of relatively dry years followed. There was little rain in 1579, and the next year even less. We now know that 1580 was unusually dry across much of North America. This tree formed a ring only a few cells thick. It survived that drought, and many more like it over the next 400 years. Recent years have brought scant precipitation. Its growth between 2013 and 2016 is just a thin sliver of tissue, with as few as three cells forming in as many years. We took this sample in July 2021, after the tree should already have been growing for months. No sign of cells indicating new growth could be seen.

As a dendrochronologist, I examine tree rings to study climate. I hunt for old trees and use a simple hand tool — which does not harm the tree — to bore deep into trunks looking for evidence of ancient drought and deluge. For 20 years, first with my teachers and later with my students, I’ve visited old-growth forests across the American Southwest, watching dry season after dry season pile up.

These withering years are killing trees. We have watched their habitats shrink, as warmer temperatures pull moisture out of the ground at lower elevations and drive woodlands to higher, cooler slopes. I’ve taken samples from healthy younger trees and returned years later to find them dead or dying. The matriarchs, the largest, oldest and most deeply established trees in many groves, seem to be hanging on for now. But no scientist is sure how much more they can endure.

A recent study published in Nature Climate Change analyzed the rings of thousands of living trees and architectural wooden beams from around the Southwest to reconstruct a 12-centuries-long timeline of climate extremes. The authors concluded that there was probably not a drought as severe as today’s in the past 1,200 years.

Our planet produced decades-long megadroughts well before humans had a discernible impact on the climate. Tree rings and weather records make it possible to see how and why today’s megadrought is so different from those that came before: Rising temperatures over the past two decades, clearly attributable to the burning of fossil fuels, have greatly increased the severity of the Southwestern drought.

We have spiked the climate system, releasing heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere faster than at any other time in at least the past 50 million years. Human-fueled megadroughts like this one will be more frequent and severe in the future. In the Southwest, there will be more years with declining snowpack, more years with water shortages and a more dire mismatch between where water is available and where it is needed.

A century of successful wildfire suppression has ensured that when the forests of our dry lands finally catch flame, they will burn much hotter than before. Rare, high-intensity wildfires kill trees that the low-intensity fires of the past did not. Tree rings we are able to collect this season might not be around to sample in the next.

That danger was evident last summer, when our research group pulled off the highway near Mount Pinos to extract core samples from living big-cone Douglas fir trees. Years ago, we wouldn’t have hesitated to bring chainsaws to collect entire discs of tree trunks from fallen trees. But not last year. We would leave the fallen trees where they were. We could not chance an errant spark that could ignite a wildfire.

The forest was a tinderbox.

A U.S. Forest Service warning just yards from the grove. Daniel Griffin

The risk is even more acute at lower elevations, where temperatures are higher. That is the case for the vast oak woodlands that range across the dry foothills of California.

Blue oaks, named for the color their leaves take on deep in the summer season, are revered among dendrochronologists. They can live for more than 550 years, survive on as little as 10 inches of average annual rainfall and are among the most drought-adapted of any tree species in the state. Kelly Redmond, a leading climate scientist and observer of climate change across the American West, referred to blue oaks as natural rain gauges. They grow at low elevation and early in the season, in tight synchronicity with the rainwater of winter and spring. And they lack the growth quirks of some other tree species that can muddy the signals of heat and precipitation. The conventional wisdom for years has been that oaks never miss a ring.

But when we arrived at a site low in the foothills, we found dozens of dying trees with sickly branches barren of leaves. Looking at core samples back at the lab, we found missing rings where 2014 and 2021 should have been.

Blue oaks are drought resistant, but only to a point. As we worked our way up the slope, we found oaks with healthier canopies, surviving despite the intense stress. At higher elevations, the summer California heat is slightly tempered, and the rain falls just marginally more, enough to keep these trees alive.

Oak growth pushed to higher elevations Conditions in this woodland, where blue oak thrived for centuries, has made growth impossible at lower elevations during the driest years. Here, we have digitally separated rings from three blue oak trees ranging in elevation along a slope near Bakersfield, Calif. 3,900 ft. elevation 3,250 ft. elevation 2,500 ft. elevation 2013 No ring 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 No ring 2021 The trees at the highest elevations weathered the three driest years.

Climate change will push the blue oak’s survivable range upslope, like a tidal wave engulfing an island, forcing inhabitants to gather at the highest ground as the dryness rises.

Across the Southwest, forests are now living on a knife’s edge. If wildfires find groves like these amid this intense drought, they may be deadly — to the Douglas firs and blue oaks that we study, to the plants and animals that live among them and to people who have built their homes near these weakened trees. Will a new forest be able to grow out of the ashes?

And Climate Change Isn’t Helping.,"And, the more severe the dry spell, the more severe the reduction in their abundance, said Philip Martin, a researcher at the Basque Center for Climate Change in Leioa, Spain, and one of the lead authors of the study. Under extreme conditions, “you’re losing way more than just that 39 percent figure,” Dr. Martin said.

Earlier research has indicated that the abundance of springtail populations is broadly linked to heat. Each degree of Celsius increase in temperature corresponds with a drop of springtail populations by almost 10 percent, according to a 2023 analysis.

“They really do bad,” Gerard Martínez-De León, a doctoral candidate in terrestrial ecology at the University of Bern in Switzerland, said of springtails during heat waves. “If there are very high temperatures for, let’s say, one week, two weeks, one month, this affects them directly. Probably as much as the lack of moisture does.”

Droughts also change and shrink the populations of fungi living in the soil, according to research published in January, which is what springtails predominantly feed on.

Yet, there are a few factors playing in favor of soil dwellers.

Generally, mites do better in heat than springtails, and studies suggest that some springtail species are better than others at withstanding heat and dryness. When times get tough, some invertebrates will move further down into the soil or travel out to more moist spots in their surroundings, say, under a rock. And, others will pick up new diets and tweak their preferences.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.3071,"['Spain', 'Switzerland']","['Martin', 'Bern', 'Leioa']"

Sound familiar? Six years later, Californians have lived through yet another cycle of lengthy drought followed by record-breaking destructive rains. Dozens of atmospheric rivers over the winter removed all of the state from drought conditions.

The transformation from drought to deluge and back again can feel so complete that it’s easy to forget what conditions were like just a few years before, or how long we’ve been lurching between the two.

1471,2023-02-27,Why It’s Hard for California to Store More Water Underground,"Despite the storms that have deluged California this winter, the state remains dogged by drought. And one of the simplest solutions — collecting and storing rainfall — is far more complicated than it seems.

Much of California’s water infrastructure hinges on storing precipitation during the late fall and winter for use during the dry spring and summer. The state’s groundwater aquifers can hold vast quantities of water — far more than its major reservoirs.

But those aquifers have been significantly depleted in recent decades, especially in the Central Valley, where farmers have increasingly pumped out water for their crops. And as Raymond Zhong, a New York Times climate journalist, recently reported, the state’s strict regulations surrounding water rights limit the diversion of floodwaters for storage as groundwater, even during fierce storms like the atmospheric rivers this winter.

I talked to Raymond to learn more about the potential of California’s groundwater, and its limitations. Here’s our conversation, edited for clarity and length:

How did this story come about?

I did a big story last year on flood risk in California and how climate change was increasing the risk of really strong storms. It was during the drought, and nobody in California was really thinking about the opposite problem, but they are two sides of the same hydrological equation. With climate change, you get both stronger storms and potentially longer and more intense droughts. In December and January, a bunch of strong storms swept through, and a lot of the concerns I was talking with experts about last year were realized.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,news analysis,0,0,0,0.9316,[],"['New York', 'Much']"
1472,2022-09-08,Climate Change Could Worsen Supply Chain Turmoil,"Chinese factories were shuttered again in late August, a frequent occurrence in a country that has imposed intermittent lockdowns to fight the coronavirus. But this time, the culprit was not the pandemic. Instead, a record-setting drought crippled economic activity across southwestern China, freezing international supply chains for automobiles, electronics and other goods that have been routinely disrupted over the past three years.

Such interruptions could soon become more frequent for companies that source parts and products from around the world as climate change, and the extreme weather events that accompany it, continue to disrupt the global delivery system for goods in highly unpredictable ways, economists and trade experts warn.

Much remains unknown about how the world’s rapid warming will affect agriculture, economic activity and trade in the coming decades. But one clear trend is that natural disasters like droughts, hurricanes and wildfires are becoming more frequent and unfolding in more locations. In addition to the toll of human injury and death, these disasters are likely to wreak sporadic havoc on global supply chains, exacerbating the shortages, delayed deliveries and higher prices that have frustrated businesses and consumers.

He supported Senator Bernie Sanders for president, he doesn’t like former President Donald J. Trump and he voted for Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2018.

But lately, he said, high taxes on milk, coronavirus shutdowns that have cut into his sales and state-imposed limitations on water for agriculture have made him so angry at Mr. Newsom that he has paid for seven billboards throughout the state — most of them in the Central Valley, which produces a quarter of the nation’s food — urging people to remove the governor in Tuesday’s recall election.

Mr. Gordon said he has spent about $44,000 for the billboards. “If I had to spend my last dime to get rid of this guy, I would,” he said. School closings during the pandemic have inflicted losses in milk sales of roughly $15,000 a day, he said. Between that financial blow and his taxes, he said, he’ll have to sell his cows and close the business by next year.

Farmers are a key constituency in California, where the $50 billion agricultural sector makes up about 3 percent of the state’s gross domestic product. During this year of exceptional drought, they are feeling the pinch of water restrictions, prompting many to support the recall of Mr. Newsom and choose a successor who they feel supports small businesses and will fight hard for their water needs.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,-0.8724,[],['Los Angeles']

When the Agriculture Department finished its calculations last month, the findings were startling: 2022 was a disaster for upland cotton in Texas, the state where the coarse fiber is primarily grown and then sold around the globe in the form of tampons, cloth diapers, gauze pads and other products.

In the biggest loss on record, Texas farmers abandoned 74 percent of their planted crops — nearly six million acres — because of heat and parched soil, hallmarks of a megadrought made worse by climate change.

That crash has helped to push up the price of tampons in the United States 13 percent over the past year. The price of cloth diapers spiked 21 percent. Cotton balls climbed 9 percent and gauze bandages increased by 8 percent. All of that was well above the country’s overall inflation rate of 6.5 percent in 2022, according to data provided by the market research firms NielsenIQ and The NPD Group.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,news analysis,0,0,0,-0.7506,['United States'],['Texas']

1478,2023-05-05,Climate Change Powered the Mediterranean’s Unusual Heat Wave,"The News

The early-season heat wave that broiled parts of Algeria, Morocco, Portugal and Spain last week almost certainly would not have occurred without human-induced climate change, an international team of scientists said in an analysis issued Friday.

A mass of hot, dry air from the Sahara parked itself above the western Mediterranean for several days in late April, unleashing temperatures that are more typical of July or August in the region. Mainland Spain set an April record of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit, or 38.8 Celsius, in the southern city of Córdoba. In Morocco, the mercury climbed to more than 106 degrees Fahrenheit in Marrakesh, according to provisional data, very likely smashing that nation’s April record as well.

A three-day stretch of such scorching heat in April is already quite rare for the region in the planet’s current climate, with just a 0.25 percent chance of occurring in any given year, according to the new analysis. But it would have been “almost impossible” in a world that hadn’t been warmed by decades of carbon emissions, said Sjoukje Philip, a climate scientist at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and an author of the analysis.

“Due to warmer weather, the growing season of broadleaf trees in the Northeast and out West is being extended,” he said. “Peak leaf-peeping a few decades ago would happen earlier in the fall, and now it typically happens later on.”

According to Dr. Ober, warm temperatures are keeping some trees green later into the season, staving off the glorious crimson and gold colors that leaf-peepers love. In other regions, a lack of rain is turning others prematurely brown.

This year is shaping up to be the fifth-warmest year in recorded history. The summer of 2022 brought record-breaking heat across the globe. As the mercury rose, water levels dipped dangerously — by August, severe to extreme drought affected more than a quarter of the contiguous United States, and as of late September, a quarter of the Northeast continues to experience abnormally low rainfall.

Dr. Nicole Davi, who leads the environmental science department at William Paterson University, studies trees and the effects that events like extreme weather have on them.

1480,2024-09-27,Things Are Looking Up for Africa’s Upside-Down Baobab Trees,"Baobabs are arboreal icons that have punctuated Africa’s landscapes for around 12 million years. With crowns that can grow as large as three tennis courts, they are important for more than their role in ecosystems. The trees are featured in cultural traditions across Africa, and they also support the livelihoods of thousands of people who harvest baobab fruit.

And across mainland Africa, a researcher has argued recently, the trees are flourishing.

This finding offers a contrast with reports several years ago that Adansonia digitata, a baobab species that is widespread, was in serious jeopardy in the face of droughts and rising temperatures linked to climate change, with some of the largest baobabs collapsing in on themselves.

In 2018, researchers took note of the trees’ troubles in the journal Nature Plants.

This alarming news caught the attention of Sarah Venter, a baobab ecologist at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. She had not seen signs in her own field work that the continent’s ancient baobabs were in trouble, so she decided to conduct her own investigation, which was also published, earlier this year, in Nature Plants.

Dr. Venter found that just five of the trees flagged in the 2018 paper had actually died, while the other 10 were healthy or regrowing.

1481,2023-09-24,Saltwater in the Mississippi Threatens Water Supply in New Orleans,"Drought-like conditions in the Midwest over the summer have created a growing water problem in the New Orleans area this fall.

Water levels of the Mississippi River have dropped low enough to make the river less resistant to a mass of saltwater flowing north from the Gulf of Mexico. This circumstance, known as saltwater intrusion, is endangering the drinking water systems in and around the city, as well as smaller municipalities to the south.

Officials in Louisiana and with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers say that a “saltwater wedge” could reach water treatment plants near New Orleans in October and are working to slow the influx while also bringing in more fresh water to the region. Many water treatment facilities cannot handle water with high salinity levels, which corrode pipes and cause metals in the pipes to leach into the water.

“This is a serious situation,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said at a news conference on Friday. He said he was requesting a federal emergency declaration, and Mayor LaToya Cantrell of New Orleans signed an emergency declaration for the city on Friday.

1482,2021-01-14,Where 2020's Record Heat Was Felt the Most,"2020 was effectively tied with 2016 for the hottest year on record, as global warming linked to greenhouse gas emissions showed no signs of letting up.

Loading... Siberia and the Arctic were among the hottest regions. The heat fueled wildfires that pumped even more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Temperatures in the Siberian town of Verkhoyansk reached a record 100 degrees Fahrenheit in June, more than 30 degrees above average. The heat was also felt in Europe, which had its warmest year ever and experienced blistering heat waves as late as September. Surface cooling of the tropical Pacific Ocean, which started during the second half of the year, did little to offset the heat elsewhere. In central South America, warming and drought resulted in wildfires burning a quarter of the vast Pantanal wetland. In the United States, the warming was most significant in the Northeast and Southwest. Drought spread to half of the country.

This analysis of global temperatures, by the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and released Thursday, found that 2020 was slightly warmer than 2016. But the difference was insignificant, the institute’s director, Gavin Schmidt, said in an interview.

“Effectively it’s a statistical tie,” he said.

Other analyses issued Thursday, one by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and another by Berkeley Earth, an independent research group in California, found that 2020 was slightly cooler than 2016, as did one published last week by the Copernicus Climate Change Service in Europe. But the difference was small enough to not be statistically significant.

With the 2020 results, the last seven years have been the warmest since the beginning of modern record-keeping nearly a century and a half ago, Dr. Schmidt said.

“We are now very, very clear about the underlying long-term trends,” he said. “We understand where they come from. It’s because of the greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere.”

The planet has warmed more than 1 degree Celsius (about 2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s, when the spread of industrialization led to rising emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and the pace has accelerated in recent decades. Since 1980, warming has averaged about 0.18 degree Celsius (about 0.32 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade.

But the numbers are only a small part of the story. As climate scientists have predicted, the world is seeing an increase in heat waves, storms and other extreme weather as the planet warms, and in disasters like droughts, floods and wildfires that result. Last year offered no respite, with record fires in Australia and California, and severe drought in central South America and the American Southwest.

Some climate forecasters had thought that the arrival of cooler sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean — part of the recurring global climate phenomenon called La Niña — would tamp down temperatures this year. It is difficult to quantify the influence of La Niña, but it is clear that any effect was eclipsed by the emissions-related rise in temperatures.

La Niña only emerged in September, and is expected to continue at least through winter. The climate impact of La Niña tends to peak several months after the Pacific waters reach their coolest point, so it may have more of a cooling effect in 2021.

When La Niña is factored in, “you’re expecting not a record warm year” in 2021, Dr. Schmidt said. “But another top-five year, and clearly part of the string of very warm years that we’ve been having,” he added.

Dr. Schmidt said his team and others have been studying the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on 2020 temperatures. Lockdown orders and the economic slowdown reduced greenhouse gas emissions by about 10 percent in the United States alone, according to a recent report.

Such a reduction does not have an immediate effect on temperatures, Dr. Schmidt said, and emissions presumably will rise again as the pandemic fades and the world economy returns to normal.

Of greater short-term effect, he said, may be the reduction in some transportation-related pollution, notably tailpipe emissions of nitrogen oxides, as driving has declined during the pandemic.

Nitrogen oxides form aerosols in the atmosphere that reflect some of the sun’s rays, which otherwise would strike the surface and be re-emitted as heat. Even a slight reduction in these aerosols would allow more sunlight to reach the surface, generating more heat to be trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases.

Dr. Schmidt said efforts were underway to quantify the effect over the past year. “The numbers aren’t large,” he said, but they may have played a role in making 2020 a record-tying year.

1483,2023-08-30,"In a Storied River, Fish Are Dying in Droves as Climate Change Scorches Canada","The salmon were once so plentiful in the river that old-timers talk about having been able to cross on the backs of fish so thick they were like steppingstones. Such was the renown of the Cowichan River, flowing east on Canada’s Vancouver Island, that its fly-fishing conditions were posted in fishing clubs in London. John Wayne and Bing Crosby were regulars in Cowichan Bay.

So when hundreds of young salmon and trout were found dead in the river last month, even as record wildfires burned across Canada, the news made the front page of the local newspaper. The die-off, the biggest in living memory, quickly led to an investigation.

It remains a mystery. Government officials found partially treated wastewater in the river a couple of weeks after the fish were found, but they have yet to draw conclusions about its impact. Local scientists suspect the bigger culprit is climate change, which has contributed to the decline of salmon populations in British Columbia by increasing droughts and heat waves.

In a summer of global catastrophes for Canada, climate change has been felt across this vast country — from Cowichan Valley on the Pacific Coast to Halifax on the Atlantic, from the long border with the United States to the remotest towns above the Arctic Circle.

They understand the acrimony among the seven Colorado Basin states, unable to agree on a plan for deep cuts in water use that the federal government has demanded to stave off disaster.

But a decade ago, the water managers of the Yakima Basin tried something different. Tired of spending more time in courtrooms than at conference tables, and faced with studies showing the situation would only get worse, they hashed out a plan to manage the Yakima River and its tributaries for the next 30 years to ensure a stable supply of water.

But larger cuts, affecting far more of the 40 million people in the West who rely on the river for at least part of their water supply, are likely in coming years as a warming climate continues to reduce how much water flows into the Colorado from rain and melting snow.

sabrina tavernise

Today, my colleague, Christopher Flavelle, says that the way California chose to deal with its water in the past has made today’s flooding worse and amounts to a missed opportunity for the future of California’s water crisis.

christopher flavelle

It serves to really illustrate how much of that valley really is a floodplain.

sabrina tavernise

Yeah. It’s Thursday, January 12. So, Chris, I keep catching glimpses in headlines about terrible weather in California — you know, catastrophic flooding, storms, evacuations, and even deaths. So tell me what’s happening in California right now.

christopher flavelle

There’s no single stat that captures what’s happening. So here’s a list of stats. As of now, you’ve got almost 5 million people under flood watches. You’ve got 60,000 households without power, evacuation orders in seven counties. 28 emergency shelters, two nursing homes had to be evacuated, 53 roads closed. The Santa Barbara Airport is closed. Rail lines are closed. And there’s more rain coming. According to FEMA this morning, total rainfall in the past few weeks in California has been 400 percent to 600 percent above average.

sabrina tavernise

Oh, my god.

christopher flavelle

So this is an epic event. So it’s hard to find a way to convey just how bad this is. The examples are heartbreaking. There’s a story about a five-year-old swept away from his mother’s arms, a toddler crushed by trees. “The LA Times” noted, compellingly, that the death toll so far is higher from these floods than the past two wildfire seasons combined.

sabrina tavernise

Oh, wow. That’s incredible.

christopher flavelle

So the human toll is excruciating.

sabrina tavernise

And it’s striking that it’s just, like, all over the state, right? It’s not just in the south, just in the north. It’s really everywhere.

christopher flavelle

Yeah, it’s rainfall event after rainfall event, each a bit different, hitting in different places. But they’re all impacting the same sort of system of dams and rivers and levees, gelling together into one megacatastrophe.

sabrina tavernise

And, Chris, explain this because it seems like this is just, as you say FEMA’s pointing out, far more than normal. What’s going on?

christopher flavelle

So the phrase that everyone has become painfully used to now is “atmospheric rivers.”

sabrina tavernise

Hold on. Remind me, though, what’s an atmospheric river?

christopher flavelle

Sure. “Atmospheric river” refers to a concentration — some call it a plume — of moisture high in the atmosphere. And what that means is as the wind and a storm system blows that over land, you get intense volumes of rainfall. And in California, there’s a pattern. My colleague Raymond Jong pointed this out in a masterful piece last year. Because of weather patterns in the Pacific and because of where California is, you’ve got a pattern of more intense and more severe rainfall moving in from the Pacific and delivering this kind of sustained, severe rainfall that just overwhelms California.

sabrina tavernise

And I assume all of this is made worse by climate change.

christopher flavelle

Yeah, and heavy rainfall and storms, of course, aren’t the only manifestation of climate change for California. These storms and floods are happening at the same time that California is grappling with a severe and ongoing drought, drought so bad that it challenges the notion of drought, right? A long-term decline in moisture levels — and wildfires, right? So you’ve got a landscape that’s really been primed to flood because the drought kills vegetation. So you get less vegetation on the ground to soak in the rain before it runs off. And wildfires leave burn scars across the landscape, which means even more sort of acceleration and velocity as that rain hits the ground and runs off. So it’s the combination of these different kinds of crises that together put California where it is. [MUSIC PLAYING] But those are just the natural factors. That’s just the natural climate and the weather patterns that California is wrestling with. There’s one thing that you can’t leave out of this discussion, which is the physical environment that’s been built by people in California for decades and even centuries, which is actually contributing to this, not just in the sense of greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change, but in the sense of how California has built its system for holding, managing, and flowing water through the state, because that system, as we’re now learning, has actually made California even more vulnerable to the kind of flooding that we’re seeing now and made the problem even worse than it would’ve been otherwise.

sabrina tavernise

So, Chris, explain that. What kind of system are we talking about here?

christopher flavelle

So the story begins in the second half of the 1800s, where California is beginning to realize that it’s got in the Central Valley a fantastic source of agricultural wealth. But there’s one big problem, which is water. The soil is fertile. There’s plenty of sunshine. What they don’t have is water at the right time, which is in the hottest season, in the summer. So the first turning point is in the early 1900s, where farmers get access to better technology to pull water out of the ground through wells and better pumps. And they use that to irrigate a whole new array of high-value crops. And the result is an explosion in farming and in wealth in the Central Valley. But if anything, they leaned into it a little bit too hard because by the 1930s, they could tell that groundwater was being drained far faster than it could be replenished. And so it became clear by the ‘30s something had to change. So California began embarking on what’s been called the largest public works project ever at the time, which was the Central Valley Project, building a series of enormous dams that would capture runoff from the Sierra Nevada, hold it behind dams, and route it as irrigation water through this empire of farms that had sprung up in the Central Valley. At the same time, the federal government built the Hoover Dam, which allowed it to harness the water of the Colorado River, which was another source of irrigation and drinking water for California and the states around it. So you got these two megaprojects that together just transformed the landscape and the potential of California.

sabrina tavernise

So a major feat of engineering.

christopher flavelle

An unbelievable feat of engineering, and it worked. It turned the Central Valley into arguably the most important patch of farmland in the US and maybe in the world. It produces about a quarter of the food that the US consumes, almost half of some fruits and nuts. And it’s really a core pillar of California’s economy, which is the fifth-largest economy in the world.

sabrina tavernise

OK, but so how are those decisions from decades ago which drove California’s success making the situation now in California worse?

christopher flavelle

Well, there’s two problems that arise from the way the system has been built. The first one is when you get severe, intense rain events, there’s just not enough room for that water. You get more flooding because the channels that have been created for those waters by building those levees just become too narrow for the volume of water that you get. You can imagine a world before levees, or with no levees, where, when you get intense rainfall, the water just goes everywhere and fills the land. People will sometimes refer to the Central Valley as the Inland Sea because it had a propensity to flood during parts of the year and even have standing water. That no longer makes sense, because we’ve had almost 200 years of farming and large-scale developments. You can’t just let water go everywhere at this point in the Valley without causing massive destruction to fields and orchards and towns and cities. And so the challenge is finding a way to control the water without being too aggressive so it’s got nowhere to go.

sabrina tavernise

Right. You know, if there were no farms or towns there, a flood wouldn’t be a big deal, right? But because there are levees that allowed for all that development, it is a massively big deal, as we’re seeing right now.

christopher flavelle

That’s right. At some level, you can’t reset the clock, right? You can’t just erase the developments and the agriculture that now defines the Central Valley. The best you can do is try and find a way to really tinker with the system because those farms and people aren’t going away.

sabrina tavernise

Right.

christopher flavelle

But there’s another fundamental problem with California’s approach to water as rainstorms get worse. And that is that the system that the state uses now doesn’t try to take advantage of all this excess water to recharge the state’s all-important aquifers.

sabrina tavernise

OK. So help me understand what an aquifer is.

christopher flavelle

Wherever you are in the world, the ground beneath you isn’t solid. In many cases, there are porous structures. There’s space between the rocks. There’s even caverns. That space often holds water. And that water is accumulated over centuries and millennia from rainfall and from glaciers. It’s a gigantic reserve of water that can be pulled up out of the ground through wells and used to irrigate crops or provide drinking water for people. And that aquifer, that groundwater, is really arguably California’s most important resource. And it’s been heavily drained down, depleted by more than a century of farming and population growth. And flooding could be — could be — a way to help recharge that groundwater so there’s more of it for the future.

sabrina tavernise

OK. So then, what do you mean when you say that the system the state has now doesn’t take advantage of this flood water to replenish the groundwater, the aquifer?

christopher flavelle

Right now, the system is you’ve got these giant reservoirs, dams, and they’re meant to capture this excess floodwater, which is great. You can use it later. But it only does so much. And you’ve got, as we’ve seen, water going where it’s not meant to go, right? So every time a community or a home gets flooded, in addition to the tragedy that is for people who live there, it’s a waste because that is — you just get horrible, disgusting runoff that makes its way to the ocean, right?

sabrina tavernise

That no one can use.

christopher flavelle

Yeah. I’m not somebody who thinks the world must always be how it’s always been. But there is something to the idea that this is the system nature built, right? These rivers take the course they do. And that’s what made this farmland so fertile in the first place, right? They flood regularly. The sediment spreads across fields. And the aquifer is where you need it, right? The aquifer that you want in the Central Valley is in the Central Valley, right? So if the water leaves the valley and heads to the coast, you’ve lost it. Even if it sort of drips into marginal aquifers underneath Santa Barbara, that doesn’t help the almond grower in Bakersfield.

sabrina tavernise

Right.

christopher flavelle

The way advocates put it to me was that if you deliberately and intentionally widen the rivers, you get better groundwater recharge where it’s supposed to happen, reaching the aquifers that you want to use for farming, rather than that water rushing into towns and cities and, sure, reaching into the soil. But a lot of it just runs off, causes mudslides and landslides, destroys homes, and causes all kinds of havoc in the meantime.

sabrina tavernise

So what you’re saying is that because of the way the system was set up, those floodwaters aren’t going back into the ground in the most efficient way.

christopher flavelle

That’s right. And the cost of not grabbing that water to recharge aquifers in the most efficient way, the cost of that decision keeps on going up, right? Because the surface water is drying up. It’s going away — both reduced snowpack off the mountains and reduced flow from the Colorado River. So if anything, this is an especially difficult time just to let that huge surplus of rainwater flow by, because that groundwater is becoming more and more important as sources of surface water dry up.

sabrina tavernise

Got it.

christopher flavelle

And as that surface water dries up, farmers are already turning more heavily toward groundwater. In fact, the number of dry wells reported to the state jumped in 2021. So this isn’t some future problem. Farmers are already trying to cope with reduced groundwater, even as groundwater becomes more important because surface water is slowly going away, too.

sabrina tavernise

I mean, if the surface water goes away and the groundwater goes away, you’ve got nothing, right? That’s it.

christopher flavelle

You’ve got nothing. And I’ve met vineyard growers in California who will truck in water because they lose surface water and groundwater. But that’s not sustainable.

sabrina tavernise

Right.

christopher flavelle

That’s so high-cost. You can’t keep it going for long. So, yeah, you start talking about the end of farming areas when your groundwater and your surface water aren’t available. It’s really terrible. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

So what are they going to do? I mean, is it fixable?

christopher flavelle

It is fixable. And not only that, everyone seems to agree what the fix is. The catch is the obstacles to actually doing that are almost insurmountable.

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. OK, so California’s having this severe flooding problem. And it’s being made a lot worse by systems designed over decades to essentially tame nature. So what would it take today to solve this problem?

christopher flavelle

You know, the short answer is pretty straightforward. You can make more room for the river by pulling back the levees and setting aside more land on either side of these rivers so that when there is really intense rainfall, there’s more room for the water and more chance for that water to sink down and recharge the aquifers. The problem is doing that is really, really, really hard.

sabrina tavernise

Why is it so hard, Chris?

christopher flavelle

Start with the economics, right? If you want to pull a significant chunk of land out of agricultural use, out of residential use, and you’re the state, you’ve got to buy that land.

sabrina tavernise

Right.

christopher flavelle

So you got to find the money to buy that land, and many homeowners and farmers won’t want to sell that land. So at some point, you don’t just buy it. You’ve got to seize it through eminent domain. So that gets into the politics. Politically, there’s nothing quite as painful as when state or local officials try to force people off their land. But maybe even more overwhelming than the economic challenge of buying the land or the political challenge of taking the land, and just the cultural barrier to this, because, culturally, California, like the rest of the West, was built on the philosophy that, as you said, we can tame nature. We can bend nature and make it work for our goals. And the underpinnings of this idea of more room for the rivers is that at some point, you can’t keep taming nature. You’ve got to bend to nature and accept that human plans have limitations. And those limitations are getting more pronounced with climate change. And I don’t know how you get a community or a state or a country to that point where people are willing to accept that we can’t always tame nature.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so very hard politically. But wouldn’t another downside be California as breadbasket? I mean, wouldn’t we lose a significant amount of agricultural land?

christopher flavelle

Doing this, making more room for the rivers, would definitely involve taking some farmland out of production. But from the conversations I had for reporting this story, it didn’t seem like, as a total share of Central Valley farmland, this would mean taking a huge amount out of production. And it could arguably make the whole system more sustainable because the farmland that remains would have more groundwater to draw on in the future. And in general, I couldn’t find anybody who said that this would have serious negative consequences. Everyone seemed to agree this was going to be beneficial in the long run if we could do it.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so it sounds like the hardest thing here is that it’s a political loser, right? It would cost a ton of money, which would probably mean more taxes, which people hate. And it would make some people have to give up their way of life, all in service of some long-term benefit, which you know, Chris, especially as a climate reporter, people really don’t want. They don’t want to do that.

christopher flavelle

Absolutely. And to California’s credit, they’re starting to do some projects along these lines, some pilot projects. But to make it work at scale, as you said, would just be so hard politically, economically, and culturally, that it’s a great example of the big change that you need as these weather patterns and weather extremes get worse. And the question is always, will lawmakers and officials want to take the chance? To be clear, this isn’t a panacea. Even if California can pull this off and give its rivers more room, that wouldn’t solve the problem of flood damage. And it wouldn’t solve the problem of access to water for irrigation, for drinking water, for cities. Those things would remain challenges. But having said all that, there is some good news here, which is that despite all the practical impediments and obstacles to actually making these changes, if California could do it, it would be that rare case in climate adaptation where you’ve got a single change that can check a bunch of different boxes all at the same time, right? You can reduce the severity of flooding. You can increase groundwater recharge. You can even provide new habitat for wildlife in these reclaimed river areas. From my reporting on adapting to climate change, it’s rare to find a solution or a policy change where you get all those different wins at once.

sabrina tavernise

Right. And you talk about rare. I mean, it’s also presumably pretty rare to solve an effect of climate change — the drought in California — by harnessing another effect of climate change, the rains.

christopher flavelle

That’s right. There’s almost a beautiful symmetry to it, taking two challenges from climate change and almost directing them against each other to help with both. So California, in a sense, is lucky, right? If you compare it to other states in the Southwest, like Nevada and Arizona, they don’t have the good luck of having to fight through too much rain and too much flooding. The outlook in those places is a lot less sunny. But California at least has a chance to turn this around. And bear in mind the storm that California is suffering through right now is not the worst it’s going to see. As my colleague Raymond Jong has written, California has to worry about much worse megastorms, the kind of storms that lasts for 30 days without a pause. Those storms are what could make this decision about more room for the river look like it’s not just a luxury, but something that California has to fix, because as these floods get worse, the damage will grow and just becomes catastrophic.

In wetter times, the lake is a recreational paradise and a vital water supply for residents on both sides of the border. But this summer, the National Park Service has closed many of the boat ramps, and the watercraft that do go out have had to dodge exposed rocks.

“The fishing tournaments are moving to other lakes, because they are concerned about hitting something,” said Raul Cordero, a fishing guide of 10 years on the lake. “We are in dire need of water. We need a big hurricane. That’s what fills this lake.”

He might not be the only one rooting for tropical storms. Lake Amistad feeds the Rio Grande, which twists and turns southward more than 250 miles to another artificial oasis at Falcon Lake.

1489,2023-09-03,"Big Farms and Flawless Fries Are Gulping Water in the Land of 10,000 Lakes","UNCHARTED WATERS Big Farms and Flawless Fries Are Gulping Water in the Land of 10,000 Lakes When Minnesota farmers cranked up their wells in a drought, they blew through state limits. Thirsty crops included corn, soybeans and perfect, fry-friendly potatoes.

The drought that gripped Minnesota in the summer of 2021 was one of the worst on record. Day after day a blazing sun shriveled leaves, dried up waterfalls and turned ponds to puddles.

In a state known for its 10,000 lakes, many people could do little except hope for rain.

But big farmers had another option. They cranked up their powerful irrigation wells, drenching their fields with so much water that they collectively pumped at least 6.1 billion gallons more groundwater than allowed under state permits. Nearly a third of the overuse happened on land affiliated with one company, R.D. Offutt Farms.

The water helped R.D. Offutt to achieve its objective of creating long, smooth potatoes that effortlessly sail through the slicers at frozen food processors so Americans could have one of their favorite foods: McDonald’s French fries.

It takes a lot of water to make a perfect fry.

By turning on the taps in the depths of drought, R.D. Offutt and other farmers in the state — where thousands of wells irrigate potatoes and other water-intensive crops like corn, soybeans and sugar beets — blew through limits designed to protect aquifers that supply drinking water to millions of people.

For some Minnesotans, it significantly worsened the drought’s effects. And it exposed how dependent much of the state has become on aquifers that are fragile and often poorly understood.

The increasing overuse of groundwater is a nationwide problem, a New York Times data investigation found, with big cities and industrial farms alike draining aquifers at alarming rates. The practice threatens not only drinking water supplies for millions of Americans but also the nation’s status as a leading exporter of food.

In Minnesota, watersheds started to dry as the heavy irrigation in 2021 lowered aquifer levels. Trout streams warmed when huge wells siphoned away the cooler underground water that normally fed the streams, scientists said, threatening fish populations. And in parts of Minnesota, people reported backyard wells drying up, sometimes leaving kitchen faucets to cough and sputter as though they were gasping.

Officials in Warren, Minn., partly surrounded by sugar beet fields, had to physically lower the pump at the town’s well by 63 feet in order to keep providing drinking water to more than 1,500 residents, including those in a hospital and nursing home. One older woman outside Warren said the only way she could get water after her own well went dry was to drive her riding mower to a neighbor’s house to fill water bottles. State officials wound up suspending four irrigation permits in the area.

In Backus, Minn., Mike Tauber, whose forested land abuts potato fields affiliated with R.D. Offutt, was shocked to find dried-up, exposed banks along a pond so big he had nicknamed it “Super Pond.” And in the northwestern part of the state, members of the White Earth Nation worried that farmers’ irrigation wells were draining culturally significant bodies of water.

Trout fishermen worry that the Straight River is warming as irrigation wells pump out cooler groundwater that would normally feed the river.

“I understand farmers have got to make a living, too, but at the same time they’ve got to take other human beings into consideration,” said Trevor Milbrett, of Eagle Bend, Minn., who sometimes drove his pregnant wife and toddler to his parents’ house for showers and supper that summer because nearby irrigation had left him with no water.

Potato farming is not the only big agricultural user of groundwater in Minnesota. The state is one of the nation’s top producers of corn, another heavily irrigated crop. But potato farming in particular shows how a host of seemingly unrelated factors — the demands of industrial French fry production, for example, or the fact that people will spend more money for fries with fewer unappetizing dark spots — can send water use soaring.

In a written statement, Warren Warmbold, vice president of R.D. Offutt Farms, said, “The story of 2021 was either going to be about water overages or food shortages.” Along with other farmers, he said, “we had to make difficult decisions around water use in order to save our crops and keep the food supply secure and affordable.”

Mr. Warmbold also said that, over the years, R.D. Offutt had used less water than its permits allocated 97 percent of the time. “We don’t take these decisions lightly,” he wrote.

The practice of irrigating mainly with groundwater, once concentrated in America’s arid West, is marching eastward across the country even as it declines in many Western states, where aquifers are drying up.

Minnesota in the early 1960s had fewer than 50 permits for irrigation wells. By 2022, there were over 7,000 of them.

And, like many other states, Minnesota uses an honor system for reporting water use from wells like these. Farmers self-report their usage annually.

This year, Minnesota lawmakers moved to rein in irrigators by increasing fines for pumping too much water, but it’s unclear whether regulators will use the new tools. Officials said that in 2021, they were hesitant to fine farmers who were already struggling with crop loss.

What happened in Minnesota offers a warning to the rest of the country. Even in a state with a culture tied to watery abundance, groundwater overuse in some areas quickly had dire consequences. And it remains unclear whether the steps taken to prevent a repeat are strong enough.

“We have this really intensive groundwater use, expanding to aquifers we don’t yet understand very well, in places where domestic wells have never had to compete for groundwater,” said Ellen Considine, a hydrologist supervisor with the state’s Department of Natural Resources. As a result, she said, “we may not be leaving enough groundwater for future generations.”

Thirsty Farmland

To understand why big farms use so much water, consider potato aesthetics.

People don’t want French fries that just taste good, they want them to look good, too. And since the late 1960s, the United States Department of Agriculture has set voluntary grading standards for potatoes and French fries, essentially defining what gives them value.

One important variable is French fry coloring: Those with dark markings have little chance at being called “Grade A” fries.

For farmers, that means making sure potatoes don’t have lumps, which can cause uneven coloring. Growing potatoes in fluffy, sandy soil allows them to expand into smoother shapes.

Watering is important, too. A potato can end up shaped like a bowling pin if it doesn’t get consistent water. That matters to growers because an oblong spud can produce more fries, and more profit.

Demand for potatoes is soaring with the spread of fast food restaurants around the world. More than a third of America’s potatoes end up in the frozen market in grocery stores or restaurants, most of them as French fries, according to the Department of Agriculture. Or they end up on lunch trays at schools, another big buyer of fries.

R.D. Offutt employees in a potato field near Park Rapids, Minn.

In Minnesota, R.D. Offutt, which has its headquarters in North Dakota and is one of the largest potato growers in America, has planted crops on thousands of acres of land where a timber company once harvested wood from a lush pine forest. R.D. Offutt converted the land to farming to take advantage of the sandy, potato-friendly soil beneath the trees.

R.D. Offutt executives said they had put into place more efficient irrigation methods in recent years. And the company said it has partnered with scientists to develop new varieties of potatoes that aren’t as water-intensive.

In the summer of 2021, faced with the worst drought in decades, fields linked to R.D. Offutt were doused with water from more than 500 wells. R.D. Offutt supplies potatoes to companies that make fries for fast-food restaurants, including McDonald’s. It owns fields but also leases land to and from other farmers as part of its practice of rotating potatoes with other crops every few years.

In the drought year, about one-third of R.D. Offutt’s fields were planted with potatoes, executives said. But growing any crops in the sandy, porous soil requires significantly more water.

It’s not just industrial farms that gulp groundwater. Cities, power plants, factories and golf courses do, too. (In 2021 in Minnesota, a company digging an oil pipeline also breached an aquifer, sending groundwater gushing.) But irrigation is consistently one of the biggest users, and the agricultural industry’s political might, along with farming’s revered place in the American self-image, means that unsustainable irrigation practices have expanded despite the risk to agriculture itself.

The phenomenon can be seen from the window of any airplane flying over America’s flatlands. Those circles of green on the land below are the work of immense “center pivot” irrigation sprinklers that often use groundwater, tapping wells that are sometimes hundreds of feet deep.

Minnesota tries to put the brakes on excessive groundwater use with permits that consider how wells affect the area around them. But the system isn’t perfect.

“Think of our water supply as a giant milkshake glass and each well is a straw in the glass,” said Robert Glennon, author of the book “Water Follies,” who has studied agriculture’s effect on groundwater. “What most states permit is a limitless number of straws in the glass.”

500 Gallons a Minute

Many of the wells linked to R.D. Offutt and those of other farmers tap the Pineland Sands Aquifer, which is huge but also delicate, partly because it is shallow in places. Extracting water from the shallow spots can sometimes affect surface water in the region, lowering the levels of rivers or other bodies of water.

“If you just take a little bit, it’s very sensitive,” said John Nieber, an agricultural engineering and hydrology professor at the University of Minnesota. Pumping out even relatively small amounts from aquifers can lower surface water if snowmelt and rain aren’t replenishing them quickly enough.

Early indications suggest the Pineland Sands Aquifer may have recovered from the setbacks in 2021, and R.D. Offutt says its studies show “imperceptible” changes in water levels in past years. Still, state officials said that straining an aquifer year after year can have wide-reaching effects, drying out wetlands and streams.

The fact that so many Minnesotans statewide were forced to scramble for groundwater after just one summer of intense drought highlights the fragility of aquifers even in parts of the country not usually thought of as water-stressed. This year parts of Minnesota are again experiencing a drought, prompting new complaints that irrigation is drying out residents’ wells.

Many of the state’s irrigation wells are concentrated in areas of sandy soil.

A map of Minnesota uses blue dots to show the location of irrigation wells in relation to areas of sandy soil, which are depicted with a light brown color. The wells are clustered mostly around the middle of the state and south of the Twin Cities. The location of the White Earth Reservation is also shown, in the upper left portion of the map.

Dr. Nieber is partnering with the White Earth Nation to study irrigation’s effects on the Pineland Sands Aquifer. The southeast corner of the reservation sits atop the aquifer and is adjacent to dozens of wells operated by R.D. Offutt as well as other farmers, according to the tribe.

For years, White Earth members have complained about fertilizers and pesticides used by farmers. Among their concerns is that both the chemicals and the pumping for irrigation threaten tribal lakes and streams where White Earth members fish and harvest wild rice, which is culturally significant and an important revenue source.

Frustrated by what members see as an inadequate response by the state to address the effects of irrigated farming, this year the White Earth passed a measure that requires tribal officials to sign off on any new irrigation wells that farmers want to install within five miles of the reservation, a swath of territory where the White Earth says it has hunting and fishing rights.

The measure may invite legal challenges, leaders acknowledged, but is intended to send a message that more irrigation is not welcome. “We are pushing back,” said Jamie Konopacky, a White Earth attorney.

White Earth community members prayed for bountiful fish and rice.

Austin Tersteeg’s corn and soybean irrigation dried out neighbors’ wells.

During the summer drought in 2021, complaints about irrigation were filed with the Department of Natural Resources faster than inspectors could keep up with them. Many came from poorer families or older people with limited income, according to a review of the complaints and interviews with residents who filed them.

In Red Lake County, Allan Armstrong said he went without water for a month at his home. But Mr. Armstrong also faced another crisis: Nearby, his parents had also lost water in their well at a time when his father was receiving hospice care at home.

“He was panicking and flipping out and running out of water,” Mr. Armstrong said of his father.

His complaint to the state expressed the urgency. “We need water now!” Mr. Armstrong wrote.

About three miles from Mr. Armstrong’s home, a neighboring farm owned by the Tersteeg family had installed a new 500-gallon-a-minute well.

The Tersteegs were trying to keep their corn and soybeans from withering. Their water use was well within their annual permitted limit, but still enough to dry out Mr. Armstrong’s smaller well and also contribute to problems for three other families’ wells.

The state required the Tersteegs to pay more than $10,000 to dig a new well for Mr. Armstrong.

Austin Tersteeg said farmers were sometimes forced to pay to replace old wells that, sooner or later, would need replacing anyway. Footing the bill for a brand new well, he said, “far exceeds the quantity and quality of water that they previously had there.”

He has asked the state to reimburse him for what he spent on his neighbors’ wells under a program to help farmers who needed more watering during the drought.

The Tersteeg farm’s headquarters is just outside Erskine, which, like many communities in Minnesota, has for decades held an annual water carnival. Mr. Tersteeg said he was confident that his farmland would be fine for generations, despite the warning signs.

“My grandkids will be irrigating from these wells,” he said. “There’s a lot of water in this area.”

Federal officials declared a water shortage at Lake Mead, the huge reservoir on the Colorado River near Las Vegas, setting off sharp cuts in water to Arizona farmers next year.

As I reported this week, the shortage declaration was made because the lake is at its lowest level since it first began to fill in the 1930s, a result of overuse and of two decades of drought in the Southwest that have reduced runoff into the river.

The declaration, and the mandatory supply cuts, had long been expected. What is less certain is how much the reductions will help. Will more cuts be necessary, and, if so, when?

Officials had an answer for that on Monday. “Additional actions will likely be necessary in the very near future,” said Camille Touton, a deputy commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,natural disaster,0,0,0,-0.8354,[],"['Federal', 'Las Vegas']"

But a slightly warmer winter doesn’t necessarily mean there is going to be less snow. A strong El Niño is expected to be the driving force behind the overall forecast this winter, pushing temperatures above normal across much of the country and raising precipitation levels in the southern United States, particularly the Southeast.

The outlook, from the Climate Prediction Center at NOAA, comes after the winter of 2022-23 was the second-warmest ever in the Northeast, and after New York City’s first measurable snow of the season arrived later than ever recorded. Though warmer temperatures may prevail again in the Northeast, more nor’easters could hit major East Coast cities this winter.

The decision to keep more water in Lake Powell on the Arizona-Utah border, rather than releasing it downstream to the other major reservoir, Lake Mead near Las Vegas, comes as both are at record-low levels after 20 years of drought made worse by climate change. Powell, behind Glen Canyon Dam, currently holds less than one-fourth of the amount it held when it filled after the dam was built in the 1960s.

“We have never taken this step before in the Colorado River basin,” said Tanya Trujillo, an Interior Department assistant secretary. “But the conditions we see today, and the potential risks we see on the horizon, demand that we take prompt action.”

Together with the release of more water into Lake Powell from an upstream dam, the decision will keep the lake at a level at which it can continue generating hydropower for the next 12 months.

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife said the river, which flows more than 400 miles from the northern mountains through the state’s capital city, is facing a “near-complete loss” of young salmon, which cannot grow beyond their egg stage in waters heated by extended temperatures of over 100 degrees.

“It’s an extreme set of cascading climate events pushing us into this crisis situation,” Jordan Traverso, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Wildlife and Fish, said in a statement.

To save as many as possible, officials transported millions of juvenile salmon to San Pablo Bay, San Francisco Bay and other seaside net pens in recent days.

I first heard about the occult practice of water divining in Australia.

There, much like in California, heat, drought and wildfires ravage the landscape. In the country’s most recent drought, farmers contended with shrinking aquifers and drying-up rivers, while cities came close to running out of water. The impacts of climate change wreaked havoc on the environment, threatening Australia’s very way of life.

These similarities were clear after I arrived in America last month, only to be met with a blistering heat wave across the Western United States that melted roads and obliterated previous heat records. In Sonoma County, the region where I live, farmers’ taps are being switched off, and vintners are digging ever deeper for water.

The situation is desperate. And I wondered: Who might benefit from that desperation?

“I don’t want to say business is booming, or business is good, but business is very, very, very busy,” Augie Guardino, a second-generation well-driller based in Santa Clara County told me. “When business is good for us, it’s not good for the rest of the community.”

He’s “similar to a mortician,” he said.

Likewise, Rob Thompson said he was swamped.

The water district has a little more than half of the water it needs to make it through the rest of the year. California relies on snow and rain at the beginning of the year to satisfy most of its water needs, and this year, the first three months were the driest on record. Next comes a hot, dry summer, made hotter and drier by anthropogenic climate change.

Last week, for the first time in its history, district officials in the Los Angeles area issued an emergency water shortage order. The goal is to reduce consumption by about 35 percent, which is far more than what the water district had to do during the last crippling year of drought in 2015. Upadhyay said if the once-weekly outdoor watering rules aren’t enough to reduce water use, the district could ban all outdoor watering by September. The rule could affect 6 million people in Southern California.

I grew up in Southern California. Drought is not a new reality here. For years, the water district has sought to convince residents to replace their verdant lawns with native plants that can thrive with less water. That has had only a limited effect.

Experts blame a combination of factors, including insect attacks, drought and increased temperatures caused by climate change. Decades of fire suppression have exacerbated problems by disrupting the natural balance of ecosystems.

“The droughts and heat and climate change are killing trees widely, and there’s no clear way to put that genie back in the bottle,” said Rob Jackson, an ecologist at the Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University who is researching the ways climate change affects forests and grasslands. “We are priming our forests to die.”

The crisis in Oregon shows the critical importance of forest management as climate change alters the natural world.

First, let’s take a step back. Global average temperatures have increased because of the unchecked burning of coal, oil and gas for 150 years. That has created the conditions for more frequent and intense heat waves.

That extra heat in the atmosphere has created a greater likelihood of extreme, sometimes catastrophic, weather all over the world. While that doesn’t mean the same extremes in the same places all the time, certain places are more susceptible to certain disasters, by virtue of geography. Australia could see more intense drought.

Rechanneling water from rural areas to thirsty growth spots like the suburbs of Phoenix has long been handled by municipal water managers and utilities, but investors adept at sniffing out undervalued assets sense an opportunity, Ben Ryder Howe reports in The New York Times.

To proponents of open markets, water is underpriced and consequently overused. In theory, a market-based approach discourages wasteful low-value water uses, especially in agriculture, which consumes more than 70 percent of the water in the Southwest, and creates incentives for private enterprise to become involved.

These disappointing numbers represent a marked change from late 2021. In December, Californians reduced residential water usage by more than 15 percent, exceeding Gov. Gavin Newsom’s conservation target. October and November saw significant savings as well.

So why the backslide?

Well, California is in the midst of a brutal drought that has depleted our reservoirs and snowpacks. Newsom has asked people and businesses to voluntarily cut how much water they use by 15 percent.

The study’s predictions also do not account for extreme events such as droughts and wildfires, Mr. Pillet said. In the Sonoran Desert, rapid infestations of buffelgrass, a drought-resistant plant native to Africa, Asia and the Middle East, have made the landscape highly flammable. Wildfires there have killed thousands of saguaros in recent years.

Look at them, they’ve got spines, they grow in this terrible environment.’” But cactuses, like most plants, exist in delicate balance with the ecosystems around them, he said. “There are a lot of these tipping points and thresholds and interactions that are very fragile and responsive to changes in the environment, land use and climate change.”

The new study is “pivotal,” Dr. Williams said, for showing how broadly such changes could affect cactus communities.

Climate change is causing rising temperatures and longer droughts, which together have made wildfires more frequent and devastating. This year’s wildfires, including the Palisades fire near Los Angeles, are expected to be even worse than usual, because much of the West has been stuck in an unusually bad drought.

As that risk grows, the Agriculture Department, which oversees the U.S. Forest Service, said it must double or even quadruple the amount of vegetation it removes from its forests each year. That leaves less fuel for fires that do ignite, making them easier to contain.

The amount of vegetation being removed each year “is not enough to keep pace with the scale and scope of the wildfire problem,” the department wrote.

The United States and European Union must get behind this movement now. Specific details on how much money, where it comes from, who gets it and what qualifies take time to work out. But what’s critical at the current climate conference is that wealthy countries agree to a process, with clear deadlines, to pay for the damage.

It’s not a matter of charity. Taking action is firmly in rich countries’ own interests. As climate change bears down, more factories and ports around the world — the ones that wealthy nations rely on for their phones, car parts, fast fashion and even food — will close, devastating global supply chains. Food prices will rise. More people will be displaced, leading to additional migration crises. Conflict will grow more likely as people fight over land and water. The repercussions will destabilize even the most robust economies. Preventing that outcome now, by financing recovery from climate damage, will ensure a more stable future for everyone.

But last month, sea-surface temperatures in that part of the ocean rose, scientists say, signaling the end of La Niña and the start of a new neutral climate pattern (this occurs when the sea-surface temperatures are at or near average). But this neutral period may be short-lived: By summer, rising sea-surface temperatures could lead the opposing El Niño pattern to develop, according to NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. By the fall, forecasters believe, there is a 62 percent chance El Niño will form.

The World Meteorological Organization has also said that a warming El Niño event may develop in the coming months, bringing with it another spike in global temperatures that had been kept partly at bay by La Niña’s cooling effect.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,0.7428,['United States'],[]

The upper basin states note that they do not use all the water allocated to them, and that the most significant cuts will have to come from the lower basin states, which use more than their allocated share.

Apart from the immediate crisis regarding the two reservoirs, experts in Western water issues writing Thursday in the journal Science say significant policy changes could stabilize the river over the long term, even if the drought continues. But concessions that “may be unthinkable at the moment” must be implemented soon, they wrote.

Water managers from the states, irrigation districts, Native tribes and others are discussing proposals for steep 2023 cuts, which must be submitted to the Bureau of Reclamation next month. The reductions are expected to fall most heavily on agriculture, which uses about three-quarters of Colorado water, and on the lower basin states.

“The tough thing is we’ve had these incremental steps toward reducing water use on the river, a long runway for water users to adjust to the new normal,” said Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Use Policy at Arizona State University. “And now we suddenly have this unprecedented demand to leave more water in the system.”",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.9176,['Mexico'],"['Wyoming', 'Colorado']"

A small but growing number of older people like the Hoaglands are taking climate change into account when choosing a retirement destination, real estate agents and other experts say. Armed with climate studies, many retirees are looking for communities that are less likely to experience extreme weather events, such as wildfires, drought and flooding.

David Dew, a real estate broker who sells homes near the Rappahannock River in and around White Stone, Va., said a larger number of retired clients were voicing concerns about weather patterns. With many waterfront properties in minimal danger of flooding there, the area is attracting retirees from the flood-ravaged Outer Banks of North Carolina as well as other Atlantic Ocean communities, he said.

1522,2021-07-14,The Heat Wave That Hit the Pacific Northwest,"michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.

[music]

Today: Record-breaking climate extremes are blanketing the United States this summer — from heat, to drought, to wildfires. Astead Herndon spoke with our colleagues, Sergio Olmos, about the historic heat wave that scorched the Pacific Northwest, and to Henry Fountain about how much climate change is to blame. It’s Wednesday, July 14.

astead herndon

Sergio, I feel like Portland has been basically at the center of every national news story recently.

sergio olmos

Well, we had a pretty extreme year in Portland. We had Covid shutdowns, 100 days of consecutive protests. Then we had historic wildfires where the sky just turned red. And then, finally, the city is starting to open back up again. Covid restrictions are starting to get lifted. People are starting to come out of their houses, go to restaurants, go to bars, and regular life was resuming a little bit. And then this massive heat wave just descends on the Pacific Northwest in late June.

archived recording The Northwest bracing for record-breaking and potentially life-threatening heat this weekend. Dozens of records, some of them decades-old are expected to fall —

sergio olmos

It’s Oregon, Washington and parts of Western Canada, and it brings this punishing heat.

archived recording 1 Portland hit an all-time record high of 112 earlier today. archived recording 2 Today in Portland, Oregon, temperatures soared to 114 degrees. archived recording 3 Portland hit 116 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday, making it one of the hottest places in the world.

sergio olmos

In Portland, we saw temperatures for three days in a row break record after record, and it finally got to 116 degrees.

archived recording This is some serious heat. Average temperatures this time of year — lower and middle 70s. We’re talking about —

sergio olmos

You know, 116 degrees is like 40 degrees above what it should normally be for this time of the year.

astead herndon

Wow.

sergio olmos

And that’s 9 degrees above the previous record of 107.

archived recording Many people that are not used to relying on air conditioning are needing to seek out cooling centers to stay safe.

sergio olmos

And so we see Portland thrown back into this state of emergency, right? Just like Covid or the protests, the wildfires — everything shuts down. No one’s outside. And this time, it’s a different catastrophe. It’s heat.

astead herndon

I know reporters have this weird experience, where people are staying in, and you run out. And I know that that is a reporter’s shared instinct. But can you describe what it was like over those last couple of weeks? What has it felt like, just physically being in that level of heat?

sergio olmos

Yeah it felt like, I walk out of the door, and the heat wave hits you. It’s like, OK. Feels like Vegas, right? But I’m in Portland. This is the Pacific Northwest, where it’s raining a lot of the time. It’s cool. It’s not a place you think of to buy an AC. It never gets that hot. We’re not used to this. 116-degree weather is something that — the health officer here for the county explained it that bodies acclimate to heat, but it takes time. You can’t just acclimate one day to the next, one week into the next. And so yeah, we’re not acclimated to that, and our infrastructure’s not built for it. For instance, I was driving around, and just a few blocks from my house, in the middle of the road, the pavement just buckled. It cracked, and it rose up. And the city said it was heat-related. I don’t know anything about pavement, Astead, but I assume it wasn’t —

astead herndon

I’ve never seen it buckle, so you’ve already got me shocked. [LAUGHS]

sergio olmos

Public transportation here, right? So the city, ahead of time, was like, hey, public transportation is gonna be free this weekend. If you need to get to a cooling center or anything, just get on there. Don’t worry about paying for it. But as soon as the heat hit, the streetcars and the trains — they stopped them because the overhead wires for the light rail system were being strained. They were only designed to work in temperatures of up to 110 degrees. And the streetcars — the cables that power them were actually melting.

astead herndon

Wow.

sergio olmos

So the city of Portland paused all trains, all streetcars, at the time they needed them the most. So it was harder for some people just to get to the cooling centers. And there’s a socioeconomic aspect to all this. There’s a professor at Portland State University named Vivek Shandas, and he studies climate adaptation. And during the heat wave, he went around Portland with a thermometer. It’s not the kind you buy at the store. It’s a scientific-grade thermometer. And he took measurements of different parts of Portland, and he found that the wealthiest parts of Portland were, in some cases, 98, 99 degrees. Right? And then he went to the working class parts of Portland, parts of Portland where the highest concentration of people of color, historically, have been disinvested. So not a lot of sidewalk, not a lot of tree covers, a lot of it exposed to sun, and a lot of concrete that just absorbs the sun’s radiation. He found a reading of 121 degrees in the poorest neighborhoods in Portland.

[music]

And so if you look at that and look at the big picture here, the county released a map of where people died in the city. And in the poorest zip codes, the highest number of deaths occurred. And in the wealthiest zip codes, we had the lowest number of deaths occur.

astead herndon

And what do we know about the people who died? Who are there?

sergio olmos

Right now, at least 193 people have died across Oregon and Washington related to the heat. What we know is that many of the people who died were elderly, living alone, without air conditioning. Others were homeless, and others had underlying health conditions. For example, there’s a story of an 84-year-old woman in Washington state, Dorothy Galliano, who was found dead in her home. She lived alone and had no air conditioning. A friend said that she was found with the window cracked open and the TV on, and she just imagined that Dorothy was watching TV, dozed off and just didn’t wake up. Another woman, Debra Moore, was found collapsed on the sidewalk just a few steps from a house she was visiting. And the police said that she had serious, underlying health issues. You have the story of a houseless man, Joseph Wade Davis, who’s 64. And he had just this tent on the side of the road with PVC pipe and tarp. And he was just discovered dead at 10 a.m. So it’s a mix of people. Obviously, the most vulnerable, elderly who were living alone without AC, homeless folks — these are the highest number. But there are other people, healthy adults, who also died, and some of them died at work.

sergio olmos [SPEAKING SPANISH] speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH] sergio olmos [SPEAKING SPANISH] speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

Sebastian Francisco Perez — he was the first reported workplace fatality related to the heat. And he died in the Willamette Valley, where he lived and worked. And so I went there to learn more about him. And it’s like a farmland community there, where they grow a lot of fruit, trees and kind of the breadbasket of Oregon. And I eventually tracked down his brother-in-law and his nephew, and they were working in the field when I find them. And he tells me about Sebastian Francisco Perez.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

He came from Guatemala three months ago. He wanted to have children, but he couldn’t afford it in Guatemala. Lived just very austere conditions. They grew their food. They didn’t have any wages. Came here to try to get some money to start a family.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

And he owed a coyote — these are the people that help immigrants cross illegally — he owed them $8,000 for the crossing. Five to front, three after. And so he was desperate to work. And that Saturday, when it was extraordinarily hot — and a lot of farm workers could take the day off, took it.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

He asked to work.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

He was told by relatives, like, don’t do it. It’s too hot. He said, no, please. I need the money.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

That Saturday, he was moving irrigation lines in a field of trees, and his co-workers, other laborers, found him collapsed among the trees. And they called 911, but they couldn’t tell the operator where he was exactly. A lot of the laborers, a lot of them immigrants, they work from farm to farm, and they get brought in together. And they don’t necessarily know where they are all the time. So they called his nephew, and they said, hey, he’s collapsed on the ground. We don’t know what to do.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

He tells them, take him to the shade. I’m on my way.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

And —

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

Unfortunately, they couldn’t resuscitate him. He died that day.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

[music]

sergio olmos

So this heat wave was kind of an opening salvo to what’s going to be a catastrophic season. The west is currently in the midst of a historic drought. Another heat wave is already sweeping across California and the southwest, and fire season has already begun here in Oregon. And this is unprecedented. This is the earliest in the year that I’ve covered a wildfire season. There’s a fire right now burning in Oregon. It’s uncontained. It’s already burned 150,000 acres as of Monday. And nobody expected the season to begin this early or already have been this destructive.

astead herndon

So from one climate disaster to the next?

sergio olmos

Yeah.

astead herndon

Thank you, Sergio.

sergio olmos

Thank you, Astead.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

astead herndon

OK, Henry, I’ve been speaking with our colleague who has been reporting on the heat waves out in the West. There was the record-breaking one that happened in June in the Pacific Northwest and another that’s underway in California. The question that’s running in the back of my head is, how much of what we’re seeing is related to climate change?

henry fountain

Well, you know, that’s the question that journalists and others always ask after a heat wave or other kind of extreme weather event. And it’s really a central question. So right after the late June heat wave in the Pacific Northwest, in fact, there was actually a group of scientists trying to figure that very question out.

archived recording (friederike otto) Good morning, good afternoon. Thank you very much for joining.

henry fountain

This group is called World Weather Attribution, and they held a press conference on Zoom announcing their findings. It was led by Geert Jan van Oldenborgh and Friederike Otto.

archived recording (friederike otto) In our study, we focus on the hottest day of the year, which is what broke the records and what you will have heard in the news. So the question immediately arose, what is the role of climate change in this event?

henry fountain

They try to figure out a link, if it exists, between the world that’s warming and these extreme events, like this really, really bad heat wave. And they try to do it really quickly.

archived recording (friederike otto) We have done this study within a week, and everyone worked nights and weekends and really —

henry fountain

They think that getting it out when it’s still fresh in people’s minds would help people understand the problem.

astead herndon

And how exactly do they do that analysis? How do they measure the impact of climate change when it comes to a single event?

henry fountain

They use a lot of computers, basically, that run models of the world. They simulate the world. And they run some models with the world as it is today, which is, it’s warmed about 2 degrees Fahrenheit because we’ve poured all this CO2 into the atmosphere. They also run models of a world that would exist if we hadn’t pumped all that CO2 in the atmosphere — in other words, a world without warming. And then they compare the two results. So for instance, if a heat wave like this had a 1 in 100 chance of occurring in any given year in a world that hadn’t warmed, and in a world that warmed it has a 1 in 10 chance of happening in a given year, then you know that climate change had an impact.

astead herndon

So when these scientists ran this model, what did they find?

henry fountain

Well, what you’ve got to understand about this heat wave — it was really off the charts. It was extraordinary.

archived recording (geert jan van oldenborgh) We’ve never seen a jump in record temperature like the one in this heat wave, as far as I can remember.

henry fountain

And when they ran the analysis, the results were clear.

archived recording (friederike otto) There is absolutely no doubt that climate change played a key role here.

henry fountain

This extreme heat wave in this place would have been impossible before we started warming the world.

archived recording (friederike otto) It means that, without the additional greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such an event just does never occur. Or if it occurs, it occurs once in a million times, which is the statistical equivalent of never.

henry fountain

So it was still a rare event, but 100 years ago, it was an impossible event. And that’s because the world has warmed.

archived recording (friederike otto) So heat waves are increasing in likelihood by orders of magnitude — more than any other type of extreme event.

henry fountain

And what these researchers have also found is that heat waves are more affected by climate change than any other extreme weather.

archived recording (friederike otto) So for any other type of extreme event, we do see extreme rainfall or droughts. We do see an increase maybe by a factor of four, but for heat waves, we see orders of magnitude. So this event was made at least 150 times more likely.

henry fountain

And she said that heat waves, more than any other type of climate-related natural disaster, are not only more likely, but they also tend to kill more people.

archived recording (friederike otto) And, yeah. And I think this is really — heat waves is how climate change kills us today. I think this is how climate change manifests most strongly.

henry fountain

Just think about it. A flood might affect a relatively small region, area near a river, whatever. But a heat wave can cover a huge amount of area. In this Pacific Northwest heat wave that ended in the end of June, everybody in Oregon, everybody in the state of Washington, and most of the people in British Columbia were affected. So I think the researchers estimated that that was something like nine million people, and that’s really a lot of potential victims of extreme heat. And so all of this has these scientists concerned.

archived recording (geert jan van oldenborgh) We feel that we do not understand heat waves as well as we thought we did.

henry fountain

You know, I’ve covered a bunch of these attribution studies, and I’ve talked to a lot of scientists about them. And normally, it’s pretty straightforward. But there’s one thing Dr. Van Oldenborgh said that really struck me, and I frankly I kind of found it alarming.

archived recording (geert jan van oldenborgh) I think most of us, or all of us, have just dialed down our certainty of how heat waves behave. We are much less certain about how the climate affects heat waves than we were two weeks ago.

henry fountain

Essentially, he said, like, after this heat wave, it was so unusual, so extreme, we’re not sure we really understand heat waves anymore. Like, it’s really kind of jolted us in our certainty of the way heat waves behave.

astead herndon

Henry, it sounds like what you’re saying is what really surprised you is the fact that the scientists themselves were surprised, and that they were saying the heat wave that was just experienced in the Northwest may have actually changed their understanding of how these operate. What exactly are we saying, though? How is this heat wave possibly different than ones that we have seen previously?

henry fountain

So what we’d expect with a kind of quote, unquote, “normal” heat wave is that, as the average baseline temperature goes up, you’d expect the hottest, record-breaking temperatures to go up at about the same rate more or less. But with this heat wave in the Pacific Northwest, the highest temperatures broke the record not by a couple of degrees, but by as many as 9 degrees. So the scientists are trying to figure out what’s going on here, and they say there’s really only two possibilities.

archived recording (geert jan van oldenborgh) The first one is the obvious one. It’s that it was just a really, really rare event, and this region was unlucky.

henry fountain

Maybe it’s just this confluence of bad luck, as they put it.

archived recording (geert jan van oldenborgh) I mean, the Earth is a really huge place, and weird things happen or very improbable happen somewhere on Earth on a fairly regular basis.

henry fountain

The Pacific Northwest had a heat wave that was compounded by the drought that’s been going on in the West, and the jet stream was acting funny or whatever, and maybe that’s the case. And in that case, maybe it’s not such a concern.

archived recording (geert jan van oldenborgh) The second possibility is that we could be past the threshold that made these kind of heat waves certainly much more likely.

henry fountain

But if it’s some other mechanism, some other threshold idea, that’s a concern. Maybe this one time of it now becomes once every five years or 10 years or once a year or whatever. So that’s the fundamental issue they’re trying to figure out. More and more, I think this heat wave is a big deal. It’s like a seminal event, really. Kind of like a big volcanic eruption or something, and it’s going to be studied for a long time because it was so unusual. And they’ve got to figure out why.

astead herndon

So what’s most alarming about their findings is that it could mean that we have hit a sort of tipping point.

henry fountain

It’s not necessarily that we’ve hit a tipping point. But the thing that really stuns a lot of climate scientists, and it certainly stuns a lot of people, is how fast things are happening. I’m guilty of this, too. I’ve been writing about climate change for a while, and it was always like, yeah, the big impacts are going to be in the middle of the century. Well, the big impacts are starting now. And it’s obvious now that the impacts are hitting us, but it seems like they’re sort of accelerating. So whether we’ve passed a tipping point or not, I don’t know. But we’re in a bad state right now where bad climate events are happening, and what we thought would happen in the future is happening now.

astead herndon

Hm. This makes me think back to the beginning of our conversation, when you were talking about all of those scientists who are rushing to get information out to the public after each of these extreme weather events. There seems to be an optimism at the core of that effort, a belief that, with a little more information, with a little more knowledge, that policymakers and the public will care more about this issue — will push people to do something. But I guess I’m wondering, is that true? Is this really a problem of lack of information?

henry fountain

Well, a couple of things. Scientists are scientists, right? They’re like men and women who believe in empirical thought and experimentation and getting data and analyzing it, and figuring out what’s going on and explaining it. If they’re optimistic, they think they’re going to do what they can do, which is explain the world — the way it is, the physical world, the warming world — to people. And then there are some scientists who then take that and use it to go out and directly influence the policy makers, like they go lobby Congress or whatever. But there’s a lot who just think, I’m going to do my job, and then it’s up to the public and the public’s elected officials to do their job and deal with it. And, you know, I think you’ve seen some of that. Scientists have gotten better about explaining what’s going on more quickly. And this whole attribution study by this group — I mean, that’s their goal. But what’s really going to change people’s minds is the more they’re personally affected by things like heat waves or floods or droughts, particularly if they keep happening or if, God forbid, they lose a loved one to a flood or to a heat wave.

astead herndon

I guess the “glass half full” read is that, as these things like heat waves become more tangible in people’s lives, then something will be done. But that same view also means that a lot of bad things are going to happen to people before they really come to know the bad effects of climate change. And we know that the people who are most likely to experience those negative effects are the people who are most vulnerable in our communities — the people who are most unheard, the people who have the least amount of political power to do something about it.

henry fountain

You know, sadly, I think that’s really true.

[music]

The poorest and most disadvantaged people in society tend to suffer the most from all kinds of climate-related disasters, and heat waves are really no exception. And what we’ve learned is that as the world continues to warm, heat waves are going to continue to increase in frequency and get hotter, and we may even see more events like this one in the Pacific Northwest with really off-the-charts, extreme heat. And that doesn’t bode well for all of society, but it’s especially bad news for the poorest and disadvantaged among us.

astead herndon

Thank you, Henry, for your time.

henry fountain

Well, thanks. Nice talking to you.

archived recording (joe biden) So hear me clearly. There’s an unfolding assault taking place in America today, an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections. An assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we are — who we are as Americans.

michael barbaro

In a speech delivered on Tuesday in Philadelphia, President Biden issued his most forceful denunciation to date of Republican efforts to restrict voting in states across the country and to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his victory.

archived recording (joe biden) Bullies and merchants of fear, peddlers of lies are threatening the very foundation of our country.

The speech was designed to reassure Democrats, who say Biden has failed to deliver on a promise to make voting rights a central theme of his presidency. And it comes as Republican lawmakers in Texas try to adopt voting restrictions over the objections of their Democratic colleagues, many of whom have fled the state to block the legislation.

archived recording (joe biden) I’ll be asking my Republican friends in Congress and states and cities and counties to stand up for God’s sake and help prevent this concerted effort to undermine our election and the sacred right to vote. [APPLAUSE] Have you no shame?

Here’s some of what you’ve shared, lightly edited for clarity:

“Water is far too precious here in Napa to be wasted on something as useless as a grass lawn. We hired a professional landscaper to create a xeriscaped garden filled with California natives. It is now teeming with hummingbirds, butterflies, honey bees and other useful pollinators. We use a drip irrigation system and besides some weeding chores, it just does its thing.” — Lynka Adams, Napa

“We have continued to water our lawn. While watering our lawn, we are still below our monthly allotment as prescribed by our utilities provider. In California only 10 percent of water usage is attributed to urban usage, and 50 percent of said urban usage is attributed to landscaping. That means only 5 percent of water used in California is going to watering lawns and stuff. Since my household is below our allotment, and, even if everyone stopped watering their lawns it would only be a max of a 5 percent decrease in total usage, I have a very hard time feeling in any way guilty for having a lawn that brings me some level of joy. I enjoy sitting outside on the lawn in the morning reading the paper and drinking coffee, and I don’t want to give that up for something that will not make a real difference, when the issues come down to large scale agriculture and industry.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,0.9514,['United States'],['Napa']

Now, they have their answer. “The smell was just gross,” said Mia Huffman, 18, a tourist from Maryland who had come down to Florida’s Pass-a-Grille Beach in Pinellas County recently, just in time to witness a young boy reach into the water and pluck a foot-long dead fish.

America has known dreadful summers before. The summer of the Manson family murders in Los Angeles in 1969. New York’s Summer of Sam in 1977. The summer of 2019, when there were 26 mass shootings in 18 states, including one of the worst hate-driven massacres in modern American history at a Walmart in El Paso. What is different this time is the sheer volume of catastrophe, natural and man-made — and a sense that there is no turning back from it.

“Here in Los Angeles, we have had periods of extreme drought, and periods of extraordinary flooding, and political turmoil, and ecological degradation and a pandemic in 1918, and of course heat waves and wildfires,” said D.J. Waldie, a cultural historian and author in Southern California. “But they didn’t all come on the same summer day.”

So, Mother Nature, what did you think of the Deal of the Century?

Well, Tom, not a lot. For starters, it mentioned me in only a few short sentences. Let me take you on a tour of the neighborhood, as I see it. Warning: My maps have no boundary lines, no walls — and no Areas A, B and C in the West Bank.

You can be sure that President Trump, who has declared climate change a hoax, has no idea that the Eastern Mediterranean has experienced drought conditions for 15 of the last 20 years, which is unparalleled in the modern historical record. A recent study by Tel Aviv University predicts that the Eastern Mediterranean will get steadily hotter and drier and gradually lose two months of winter — i.e., rainfall months — within the next 25 years. Meanwhile, in 1948 Israel’s population was 800,000. It’s now 8.7 million. Jordan’s was 450,000. It’s now 10 million. Syria’s was three million, and it’s now 17.5 million. So, the future is steadily more people and less water.

What are the implications?

Israel used to pump up to 500 million cubic meters of water a year out of the Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake, to meet domestic needs, including for agricultural fields in the south of Israel, to turn the desert green.

There were good schools, mountain views and cactus-spangled hiking trails out the back door.

Then the water got cut off.

Earlier this month, the community’s longtime water supplier, the neighboring city of Scottsdale, turned off the tap for Rio Verde Foothills, blaming a grinding drought that is threatening the future of the West. Scottsdale said it had to focus on conserving water for its own residents, and could no longer sell water to roughly 500 to 700 homes — or around 1,000 people. That meant the unincorporated swath of $500,000 stucco houses, mansions and horse ranches outside Scottsdale’s borders would have to fend for itself and buy water from other suppliers — if homeowners could find them, and afford to pay much higher prices.

Almost overnight, the Rio Verde Foothills turned into a worst-case scenario of a hotter, drier climate, showing what happens when unregulated growth collides with shrinking water supplies.

The Texas power grid operator has forecast that demand will reach a record high over the next week as a heat dome bakes the state.

Nationwide, electric utilities, grid operators and regulators have struggled to adequately prepare for the hazards of global warming, like storm surges that can knock out substations and heat waves that can cause power plants to falter, with many expecting that the biggest threats will not materialize for decades to come.

“It’s fair to say there was this widespread assumption that the impacts of climate change and extreme weather would unfold more gradually, and there would be more time to prepare,” said Alison Silverstein, an energy consultant based in Austin, Texas. “But in the past few years, the entire industry has really been smacked upside the head.”

1529,2023-06-15,Ocean Warmth Set a Record for May,"Why It Matters: Heat can harm ocean life and feed wildfires.

Warmer water tends to hold less oxygen, and large-scale fish die-offs may happen earlier in the year as the climate continues to warm. Last week, thousands of dead fish washed up on Texas beaches from unusually warm waters and lack of oxygen in the Gulf of Mexico. Across the ocean, higher temperatures contribute to coral reefs dying. The ocean also expands as it warms, raising sea levels even further on top of the added water from melting ice sheets.

Last month’s unusual heat contributed to Canada’s spate of wildfires. As wildfire smoke spread, air quality in western Canada and the northern Great Plains in the United States deteriorated significantly. More recently, the wildfire smoke reached cities in the Northeast and Midwest, causing Air Quality Index readings to skyrocket across much of the country.

Extreme heat can be dangerous to humans as well as wildlife. Over the next several days, parts of Florida, Louisiana and Texas are bracing for potential triple-digit temperatures, which put people at risk, especially if they work outdoors or lack air-conditioning.

But in November, he said he turned on the faucet and nothing came out. Now, when he does get running water under the rationing plan, he fills a 1,100-liter tank and hopes it lasts until the next scheduled day for running water.

That is a more regular supply than at his home elsewhere in Tlalpan. He said municipal water trucks used to come every four days or so but now take longer, sometimes up to a month. Rather than using water at home, he washes the family’s clothes at a laundromat near his shop.

“It’s scary that we’re running out of resources,” he said.

There is no evidence that Mexico’s drought is attributable to climate change. But the effects are made worse by rising temperatures.

Mexico City’s average temperature rose by around 3 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past century, more than double the global average. Exceptionally hot days (above 30 degrees Celsius, or 86 degrees Fahrenheit) have doubled in some parts of the city, according to a 2020 study.

One of the starkest findings is that heat-related deaths of people older than 65 have increased by 85 percent since the 1990s, according to modeling that incorporates both changing temperatures and demographics. People in this age group, along with babies, are especially vulnerable to health risks like heat stroke. As global temperatures have risen, older people and infants now are exposed to twice the number of heat-wave days annually as they were from 1986 to 2005.

The report, published in the medical journal The Lancet, also tracked estimated lost income and food insecurity. Globally, exposure to extreme heat, and resulting losses in productivity or inability to work, may have led to income losses as high as $863 billion in 2022. And, in 2021, an estimated 127 million more people experienced moderate or severe food insecurity linked to heat waves and droughts, compared with 1981-2010.

“We’ve lost very precious years of climate action and that has come at an enormous health cost,” said Marina Romanello, a researcher at University College London and the executive director of the report, known as The Lancet Countdown. “The loss of life, the impact that people experience, is irreversible.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,2,0,0,-0.9607,[],['London']

And the threat of more cuts looms. This week, those two states along with five others failed to meet a deadline for agreement on much steeper cuts in water use, raising the prospect that the federal government will step in and mandate further reductions.

The Colorado, which supplies water to 40 million people in the United States and Mexico and supports billions of dollars of agricultural production across the region, is in the throes of two decades of drought made worse by climate change. At the river’s two immense reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, water levels are at just 28 percent of total capacity because of the river’s diminished flow and increased demand.

As the water crisis intensified last year, the federal government for the first time imposed restrictions on the amount of water that could be taken. Tuesday’s cuts are smaller than those put in place a year ago and also affect Mexico.

Then, in March, U.S. electricity exports to Canada climbed even more, reaching their highest level since at least 2010.

The increasing flow of power north is part of a worrying trend for North America: Demand for energy is growing robustly everywhere, but the supply of power — in Canada’s case from giant hydroelectric dams — and the ability to get the energy to where it’s needed are increasingly under strain.

Many energy experts say Canadian hydroelectric plants, which have had to reduce electricity production because of a recent drop in rain and snow, will eventually bounce back. But some industry executives are worried that climate change, which has already been linked to the explosive wildfires in Canada last year, could make it harder to predict when rain and snowfall will return to normal.

“We’ve all got to be humble in the face of more extreme weather,” said Chris O’Riley, president and chief executive of the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, which operates hydroelectric dams in western Canada. “We manage from year to year the ups and downs of water, and when we have the downs like we’re having, the lower levels, it’s common for us to import power, and we expect to continue that this year.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,0,0.7,"['United States', 'Canada']",[]

Now comes the additional pressure of extreme weather, both slow and fast, aggravated by the burning of coal, oil and gas. Proponents of cash relief say it’s a more efficient way to use aid money because cash incurs fewer logistical expenses and funnels money directly into the local economy.

“Cash transfers help families survive climate disasters,” said Miriam Laker-Oketta, research director for GiveDirectly, an aid group that does just that. “Cash provides choice and reaches quickly.”

Skeptics say they are a Band-Aid solution that is no match for a battery of hazards that poor people face in the global South: deadly heat, rising sea levels, erratic rains.

Those of us who can afford bottled water use it for everything. We cook pasta, wash lettuce and make coffee with it, buying more and more plastic water containers that wind up in the dump. When we shower, we keep it short and keep the windows open, because trihalomethane compounds in the steam may be carcinogenic. Washing machines don’t foam, and the electric water heaters are failing from a buildup of sodium. Dishwashers leave salty streaks on glasses and plates. Brushing your teeth tastes like taking a gulp of pool water.

At the height of the crisis, sodium and chloride levels rose to double and triple the maximum values allowed by our national drinking water regulations. A few weeks ago, I visited a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of the city, where people had no other option than to drink the tap water. People complained of belly pain and diarrhea. The government warned that children under 2 years of age, pregnant women and people with high blood pressure, kidney failure or heart problems should limit their consumption of the water or, in some cases, avoid it altogether. Supposedly, poor people will now be getting a subsidy to buy bottled water. But that’s not enough.

Here in Uruguay, clean water is part of our national identity. Schoolchildren are taught that the country is blessed with abundant and high-quality water, thanks to many large rivers and six great aquifers.

The river is always relatively low in the early autumn, but this year the situation is especially pronounced after a very dry summer. Unless more rain falls soon in the Midwest, which is drained by the Mississippi, the southern reaches of the river could soon fall to some of their lowest levels in a decade.

The situation could persist for weeks. In a typical year, low water levels on the river begin to abate around early December, said Jeff Graschel, a National Weather Service hydrologist at the Lower Mississippi River Forecast Center in Slidell, La. “Basically, we’re not seeing any heavy rainfall over the next several weeks to indicate that we would get any relief from low water conditions for the lower Mississippi,” he said.

1546,2021-07-06,How to Collect Greywater,"“Greywater is gently used water,” says Laura Allen, 45, who lives in Eugene, Ore., in a duplex where water draining from a washing machine, showers and sinks is piped out to irrigate blueberry bushes, fruit trees, flowers and ornamental bushes. This type of household wastewater, which does not come in contact with feces, can be reused to water plants. Check regional greywater laws. Its use is legal in about half the country, especially in Western states, and even encouraged by the authorities.

The easiest way to start utilizing greywater is with a low-cost laundry-to-landscape system. Find your washing machine’s discharge hose, which is probably emptying into a nearby standpipe or utility sink. Install a three-way diverter valve, allowing you to send water either through existing pipes to the sewer or through a new, plastic pipe that you route outdoors. Once outside, insert one-inch plastic tubing into what is called barb tee fittings to direct the water to specific plants. Laundry-to-landscape systems work best to irrigate trees or bushes and not lawns or vegetable crops.

If you’re on flat ground, the pump from your washing machine is capable of moving the water about 50 feet. Dig a shallow basin near the plant where the water will drain; fill it with mulch to hold moisture. Don’t store greywater — “It gets smelly,” Allen says — or let it pool. Use only liquid laundry detergents free of boron. If you use chlorine bleach, switch your valve and send that load’s water to the sewer.

Allen became interested in greywater two decades ago, when she received her first water bill as a new college graduate in a shared rental house in Oakland, Calif. “I was shocked to see how much water we used,” she says. (Each American, on average, uses as much as 100 gallons a day at home.) She and her roommate started experimenting with D.I.Y. greywater systems, which were then illegal. Calling themselves the Guerrilla Graywater Girls, they even self-published a zine as a guide for others. In the face of historic droughts and climate change, find a way to proactively do something. If you are a renter and your landlord won’t approve your greywater schemes, find other ways to reuse water from your bath or shower. “Just go and get a bucket,” Allen says.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,0.9477,[],"['Oakland', 'Allen', 'Eugene']"

And that data offers reason for both hope and alarm.

There’s some good news, as I explain with my colleague Nadja Popovich in this recent article: Over the past decade, the world’s nations have slowly started bending the curve of future emissions downward, thanks to the rapid rise of clean energy.

But the bad news is that those efforts still aren’t nearly enough to avoid a dangerous rise in global temperatures in the years ahead. And it will take a herculean effort by governments and businesses to shift course.

The numbers: In 2014, the world was on pace for about 4 degrees Celsius, or about 7 degrees Fahrenheit, of global warming, according to data from the Climate Action Tracker. Things are slowly improving: Current policies now put the world on track for a bit less than 3 degrees C, and some of the most ambitious promises by countries to zero out their emissions could keep us at around 2 degrees C.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,news analysis,0,0,0,0.8341,['United States'],['Glasgow']
1549,2021-05-14,We’re Not Ready for the Next Big Climate Disasters,"Studies going back decades have shown, for example, that farmers and city managers who prepare for a changing climate can absorb the shocks, at least to a point. By contrast, policies such as disaster assistance and subsidized flood insurance can have the opposite effect: They invite people to invest in harm’s way and make us less prepared when disaster strikes, as will become more common in a warming world.

We have combed through data from experts and the government and have tabulated what the federal government spends on climate-related disasters, including on infrastructure and insurance. We measured the balance of spending between “building back the same,” the usual response to disasters, and investing in making our infrastructure more resilient.

Our study found that the federal government is spending about $46 billion per year on recovery from disasters, which is seven times the level of investment in resilience. (Depending on the accounting method, that ratio could be as high as 40 to 1.) That nobody really knows these numbers shows why the nation must take stock of its infrastructure and disaster spending with an eye to resilience. At the same time, the National Climate Assessment, mandated by Congress and prepared by climate scientists every four years to evaluate the nation’s climate vulnerabilities, needs to look beyond what the scary science says to assess how government policies and private investment are amplifying or dampening the potential consequences of global warming.

Resilience matters because it is impossible to wall off the country from the effects of climate change. Tens of trillions of dollars are invested in infrastructure and personal property, with a lot more investment to come. Federal money accounts for only one-quarter of the nation’s investment in public infrastructure, but how that money is spent has a big influence on how the rest of the country invests and behaves.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.9282,['United States'],['Federal']

Biden has pledged to direct 40 percent of climate spending to underserved places, including communities of color and small towns. Those places tend to be especially exposed to climate change, but usually have a harder time protecting themselves.

Keeping that pledge could be a challenge. Much of the money for climate resilience goes through competitive grant programs, and those programs tend to favor wealthy, white, urban communities. That’s because, among other things, those communities have more money to hire experts to navigate the complicated process of getting federal grants.

I spoke to officials throughout the Biden administration for my article on the bill, and it’s unclear whether they’ve found a way to remake those grant programs.

It declared an emergency over the two-decade drought that was parching the West and instructed these states, already scrambling to conserve water, to come up with a plan to cut consumption by as much as four million acre-feet, an amount equal to about one-third of the Colorado’s annual flow.

Then, after delivering this blow, the agency retreated to the sidelines. Instead of taking the lead, it urged the seven states — Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming — to figure out how to make the cuts themselves.

Since then the states have engaged in futile discussions about how much water each must forgo. Tensions have been most acute among Arizona, California and Nevada, the three states that get their water primarily from large reservoirs instead of stream flow and therefore are the only ones that can be ordered to make reductions. Arizona and California, whose allotments are much larger than Nevada’s, should make the biggest cuts, but they have been sharply divided over how to carry them out.

This week, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland at last entered the negotiations over how the cuts — revised down to two million acre-feet — should be allocated. Her agency released a draft with three options, but it clearly favors one in which the water delivered to Arizona, California and Nevada is reduced by the same percentage for each state.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,-0.5187,['Mexico'],"['Wyoming', 'Colorado']"

Despite frantic dredging, farmers could move only half the corn they’d shipped the same time last year. Deliveries of fuel, coal, industrial chemicals and building materials were similarly delayed throughout the nation’s heartland.

This critical river and its tributaries — responsible for transporting more than $17 billion worth of farm products and 60 percent of all U.S. corn and soybean exports annually — has been stricken by drought since September, amid a time of global grain shortage and soaring food prices. While water levels will recover modestly this week, thanks to some upstream rain and snow, the long-term forecast remains dry.

Conditions are even worse in the southwestern United States, where an ongoing 22-year drought — now the harshest in 1,200 years — has shriveled Colorado River reservoirs, straining water supplies for farms, cities and hydropower from the Hoover Dam. Across the Atlantic in Germany, warmer temperatures and longer droughts have shrunk the Rhine River, making navigation harrowing on a waterway responsible for up to 80 percent of the country’s ship-bound cargo.

At least 12 people were said to be missing.

The full extent of the damage remained unclear, however, as the quake had damaged communications in the remote, isolated region. In a sign that the damage might be heavy, Xi Jinping, China’s leader, personally ordered that the government “spare no effort to rescue the affected people,” state television announced on Monday evening.

The China Earthquake Networks Center initially estimated that the quake, which struck shortly after noon, had a magnitude of 6.6, but it later revised that upward to 6.8.

Cibola, Ariz., is one of the wrong places. Home to about 300 people, depending on what time of year you’re counting, the town sits on the California border, in a stretch of the Sonoran Desert encircled by fanglike mountains and seemingly dead rocky terrain. Driving across the expanse, where the temperature often hovers near 115 degrees, I found myself comforted by the sight of an oncoming eighteen-wheeler carrying bales of hay, which at least implied the existence of something living where I was headed.

Thanks to the Colorado River, which meanders through town, Cibola is a verdant oasis that chatters at dusk with swooping birds. Along both banks, a few hundred acres produce lush alfalfa and cotton, amid one of the more arid and menacing environments in North America.

This scene is unlikely to last, though. A few years ago a firm called Greenstone, a subsidiary of a subsidiary of the financial-services conglomerate MassMutual, quietly bought the rights to most of Cibola’s water.

So many of the conversations about global warming focus on the direst consequences, projected far into the future: images of fires and floods on an increasingly uninhabitable planet if the governments of the world — and especially those of the United States, China and the other leading greenhouse gas emitters — fail to curb their use of fossil fuels. But the truth is that we are already living in a world that is being transformed by climate change. Every single country on Earth is feeling its effects — today.

That is the idea behind “Postcards From a World on Fire,” a major project from Times Opinion that published this morning. Last summer, as the COP26 meeting in Glasgow approached, we began work on what I envisioned as an expansive climate project that would draw on nearly every journalistic tool at our disposal. I wanted an assessment of where things stood from every country in the world and to make a bold argument for urgency. That call to action felt even more necessary as we watched the Glasgow summit come and go with high hopes and, ultimately, tepid actions.

A team of our journalists — led by Meeta Agrawal, Times Opinion’s special projects editor — has documented one way that climate change is having an impact in each of the 193 United Nations member states. It’s been a breathtaking effort to watch come together.

There was a window of a few days before the park would be entirely closed off to the public, and two weeks until the bodies of water would be completely dry.

A five-hour drive brought the team to what was once a lake. Now, it was mostly deep, sucking mud. The air was hot and smoky. “Initially we thought we weren’t going to be trapping until the evening,” Dr. Meagher said. Platypuses are nocturnal, usually waking up around sunset. But these platypuses were already active, which, while concerning, meant the team could see where they were.

“There was hardly any water there,” Dr. Meagher said. “So they couldn’t duck down and hide and be cryptic like they usually are.”

The size of those reductions and the prospect of the federal government unilaterally imposing them on states have never occurred in American history.

Overuse and a 23-year-long drought made worse by climate change have threatened to provoke a water and power catastrophe across the West. The Colorado River supplies drinking water to 40 million Americans as well as two states in Mexico, and irrigates 5.5 million agricultural acres. The electricity generated by dams on the river’s two main reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, powers millions of homes and businesses.

But the river’s flows have recently fallen by one-third compared with historical averages. Levels in Lake Mead and Lake Powell are so low that water may soon fail to turn the turbines that generate electricity — and could even fall to the point that water is unable to reach the intake valves that control its flow out of the reservoirs.

This year alone about half a million acres of the state have been consumed by wildfires, and yet many communities were also flooded by monsoons. Across Arizona, there was a record 522 heat-related deaths in 2020, according to the state.

“Annual average temperatures in Arizona have already increased a couple of degrees due to climate change, which may not sound like much, but it has increased heat waves and droughts, it has lowered the snowpack which is essential to our water supply, and which flows in streams that are important to the health of wildlife, which is important to our ranchers and farmers,” said Gregg Garfin, a climatologist at the University of Arizona.

Arizona needs federal help to grapple with a hotter climate, he said. “We need the work force,” Mr. Garfin said. “We need the funding. Many communities in Arizona lack the budget or expertise to do this. It requires real money. And it’s super important for Arizona.”

Poor and minority communities, which are disproportionately harmed by climate change, must be included in any government plan, said Vianey Olivarria, a director of Chispa Arizona, the state branch of the League of Conservation Voters. “There is no way to have a climate action plan that does not have environmental justice,” she said.

Democrats at the forefront of pushing for climate action say none of the policies can be spared.

“We cannot slash climate funding in this package. That would go back on the promise to voters, to young people, to the American workers who don’t want to be left behind,” said Senator Edward J.

Coming off the worst wildfire season in history and in the midst of a dry winter, parts of the Santa Cruz mountains where the CZU Lightning Complex Fire burned over the summer reignited and over a hundred residents were evacuated.

The powerful winds also forced a two-day closure of the Disneyland vaccination site in Orange County and damaged roads and buildings at Yosemite National Park.

A warming climate has caused wildfire season, which typically peaks in late summer, to become a year-round affair in recent years. Wildfires in January just may be the new normal.

1573,2023-03-18,Humanity Is Facing a Great Injustice. The World Bank Must Respond.,"It’s one of the great injustices of this era that countries contributing negligible amounts to global carbon emissions are now feeling the most harrowing impacts of climate change. Pakistan, which makes up less than 1 percent of the world’s carbon footprint, had a third of its territory under water in last year’s floods. Parts of Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia are experiencing the worst drought in 70 years of record-keeping, threatening millions with famine, even though the entire continent of Africa contributes less than 4 percent of global carbon emissions. Small island developing countries such as Papua New Guinea account for less than 1 percent of global carbon emissions, yet they stand to lose the most when sea levels rise.

The World Bank and the donor countries that control it can do more to step up and tackle this generational challenge. To make the World Bank and other multilateral lending institutions fit for purpose in the 21st century, leaders need to figure out how to raise and leverage the massive amounts of capital that are going to be necessary in the coming years to help countries adapt to and mitigate a changing climate.

For years, climate financing took a back seat to the bank’s twin goals of reducing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. Today, it is integral to achieving those goals. Helping the poorest of the poor will increasingly mean ensuring access to drought-resistant seeds and access to water as lakes dry up. In middle-income countries, promoting shared prosperity will increasingly mean expanding access to reliable, affordable clean energy. The World Bank has played an active role in making progress in those areas. It has begun to help countries incorporate climate change into their overall economic development plans and should continue this necessary work.

Climate-related funding has already grown in importance at the bank; in fact, some of the poorest countries are already worried that it will cut into funding for basics like education and health care. That’s why additional funding is needed to assure them that taking global action on climate won’t come at the expense of their development. About 36 percent of the money the World Bank lent last year was classified as climate related, although questions have been raised about how classifications are made. That comes to nearly $32 billion — a big jump from previous years, but still far short of what is needed.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,news analysis,0,0,0,0.8456,"['Guinea', 'Ethiopia', 'Kenya', 'Papua New Guinea', 'Pakistan', 'Somalia']",[]

For years, they’ve just been mixing it into bags of low-priced robusta. This year, they’re trying to sell it to the world under its own true name: Liberica excelsa.

“Even if there’s too much heat, it does fine,” said Golooba John, a coffee farmer near the town of Zirobwe in central Uganda. For the past several years, as his robusta trees have succumbed to pests and disease, he has replaced them with Liberica trees.

But not this year, when fears of running out of fresh water forced officials to cancel an annual arts and crafts fair that draws thousands of visitors in Las Vegas, N.M. All over this town of 13,000 people, carwashes are closed. Swimming pools are empty. Restaurants are serving food on paper plates. And the gushing skies are no help.

Instead of replenishing reservoirs, the downpours are flooding a burn scar left by the blaze known as the Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak fire, releasing contaminants into private wells and overwhelming Las Vegas’s main water supply with ashy sludge.

It is the latest chapter in a catastrophe created by the federal government when Forest Service employees lost control of not just one but two prescribed burns set this spring to clear out undergrowth.

1576,2023-08-17,"Following the Science, Above the Ground and Below","How important is on-the-ground reporting to your coverage?

I’m based in New York City, which I wouldn’t say is the part of the country that’s experiencing climate change most viscerally. California, for example, with its wildfires and droughts, is much more on the front lines. Alaska is another example; the Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the world and permafrost and glaciers are melting. Alaska’s coasts are expected to experience more storms. Climate change is happening there, which affects the rest of the world.

How do you prepare for a reporting trip when it involves rafting 90 miles down the Colorado River?

I brought a camera, batteries, a GoPro, notebooks and a recorder. It was slightly more overhead than the scientists on the trip were used to. I also brought a solar-powered charger for my camera equipment and recorder, which proved useless. The walls of the Grand Canyon are so high that you only get enough sunlight to charge devices in the middle of the day.

How do you find article ideas?

I just follow the science. I often try to tag along with scientists on their journeys of discovery, and I keep track of what’s being published in scientific journals.

There’s a gap between how much scientists know about a subject and what is still a mystery and in need of additional inquiry; that’s always interesting to me and sometimes frustrating. My editors want clear answers, but scientists often have ambiguous ones.

1577,2021-02-11,Warming and Warnings From the High Himalayas,"On Sunday, a glacier in the Indian Himalayas burst apart, releasing a torrential flood that destroyed one hydroelectric dam project and damaged another, killed at least 32 people and left nearly 200 people missing and likely dead. Half a world away, this event might seem easy to disregard as yet another distant catastrophe — tragic yet unrelated to our daily lives.

In the Western world, we should not be so sanguine. The disaster was a direct result of extreme climate change in the world’s highest mountains. The rapid warming there offers a warning of the potential consequences for the United States and the rest of the world as greenhouse gases continue to heat the planet.

Since taking office, President Biden has sought to reaffirm what scientists have been saying for decades: An effective climate response must be guided by strong research. As his administration works to restore scientific integrity in government and slow climate change, it should also support research in the Himalayas.

Logistical barriers facing scientists in these remote mountains have complicated research efforts.

1578,2023-09-17,Which of the World’s Hundreds of Thousands of Aging Dams Will Be the Next to Burst?,"In the United States, the second most prolific dam-builder after China, the average age of dams is 65 years old and an estimated 2,200 structures are at high risk of collapse. The recent infrastructure law directs $3 billion into maintaining some of them, but there are still thousands of dams the federal government is not responsible for, and it will cost an estimated $76 billion to fix them.

The risks from aging dams are of particular concern in the face of climate change. Dams are designed to withstand worst-case conditions as they can be imagined at the time of construction. But what were once considered once-in-a-century weather events have begun occurring with increasing regularity, putting dams at great risk of either failure or a significant weakening of their integrity.

Before the disaster in Libya, extreme weather worsened by climate change was already taking its toll on these structures. Heavy rainfall damaged California’s aging Oroville Dam in 2017, prompting mass evacuations amid fears of major uncontrolled releases. A piece of a Himalayan glacier destroyed one dam and damaged another in northern India in 2021, killing dozens of people. Glaciers melting rapidly as a result of warming are now a major safety hazard to dams and communities living downstream.

The default approach has been to repair aging dams where needed, monitor reservoir levels and try to anticipate rainfall and increased flows from upstream. Take the Kariba Dam on the Zambezi River in southern Africa, which is undergoing extensive repairs to prevent its collapse after the riverbed below it was found to be severely weakened. At a cost of $300 million, these repairs are required simply to keep the dam standing on a river where hydroelectricity production has already plummeted from drought. Projects like these essentially paper over the cracks, and are often significantly more expensive in the long run than removing dams that are already obsolete.

While some aging dams still supply drinking water and help farmers irrigate their fields, many that were built for hydropower only generate a fraction of the electricity they once did as sediment accumulates behind their walls. Deepening drought linked to climate change has also crippled hydropower generation all over the world, leading to energy rationing and blackouts in the United States, China and Brazil.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.9864,"['Libya', 'Brazil', 'United States', 'India', 'China']",[]

1580,2023-01-18,Bomb Cyclone? Or Just Windy with a Chance of Hyperbole?,"Some of the vivid terminology begins with the scientists — “bomb cyclone,” for instance. “The reason we called it a bomb is because it is the explosive intensification of a surface cyclone, in other words, the winds you are experiencing near the ground where people live,” said John Gyakum, a meteorologist at McGill University who helped coin the term in the 1980s. The less-pithy definition is “a 24-hour period in which the central pressure falls by at least 24 millibars,” which is a measure of atmospheric pressure.

In the term’s early days, the weather pattern “was primarily an ocean phenomenon,” Dr. Gyakum said, and it still largely is. Perhaps more people are affected these days because the coasts are more densely populated. “Why do we hear more about bomb cyclones than we did 40 years ago?” he said. “People are paying more attention to extreme weather than in the olden days.” He added, “Talking about bomb cyclones is not necessarily an indication of increased frequency.”

According to Google Trends, the phrase “bomb cyclone” was barely uttered until 2017 but has since has risen to a din, along with “weather bomb” and “weather cyclone bomb.”

Some meteorologists said they had become cautious about what they uttered, to avoid sensationalism. “Once you use a term and let the cat out of the bag, you can’t get it back in,” said Andrew Hoell, a research meteorologist with NOAA, where he is co-leader of the drought task force. “It can be used in ways you never imagined.”

He had just finished speaking at the “Explaining Extreme Events Press Conference,” which was fairly dry, linguistically. Afterward, Dr. Hoell was more emphatic about what he won’t say: “I don’t use ‘megadrought.’” Nevertheless, later in the conference he was scheduled to participate in a town-hall discussion titled, “Drought, Megadrought, or a Permanent Change?

Our typically agreeable weather (current heat wave notwithstanding) is officially called a Mediterranean-type climate, defined as having cool, wet winters and dry, warm summers. Only five places in the world share this climate: California, Central Chile, southwestern Australia, South Africa and, of course, the Mediterranean Basin.

“The California climate of having this several-month period of no rain that coincides with the hottest time of the year is globally really weird,” said Anna Jacobsen, plant ecology professor at California State University, Bakersfield. “It’s a really special and kind of unique climate cycle.”

The location of these five ecosystems is no accident. All are on the western edge of continents, between 30 and 45 degrees latitude, with a cold polar current running along the coast.

Warns","The dangers of climate change are mounting so rapidly that they could soon overwhelm the ability of both nature and humanity to adapt unless greenhouse gas emissions are quickly reduced, according to a major new scientific report released on Monday.

The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body of experts convened by the United Nations, is the most detailed look yet at the threats posed by global warming. It concludes that nations aren’t doing nearly enough to protect cities, farms and coastlines from the hazards that climate change has unleashed so far, such as record droughts and rising seas, let alone from the even greater disasters in store as the planet continues to warm.

Written by 270 researchers from 67 countries, the report is “an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership,” said António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general. “With fact upon fact, this report reveals how people and the planet are getting clobbered by climate change.”

The perils are already visible across the globe, the report said. In 2019, storms, floods and other extreme weather events displaced more than 13 million people across Asia and Africa.

1583,2022-06-01,"A ‘Perfect Recipe for Extreme Wildfire’: New Mexico’s Record-Breaking, Early Fire Season","Fueled by abnormally dry, warm conditions and spread by strong winds, wildfires have burned more than 600,000 acres across New Mexico this spring — making it one of the worst fire years in the state’s recorded history. And there’s at least another month of peak fire risk ahead.

The explosive, early start to this year’s Southwestern fire season reflects the convergence of long-term trends — a forest landscape overgrown after decades of aggressive fire suppression and parched by drought; springtime temperatures warmed by human-caused climate change — and more immediate dangers, like the relentless winds that have fanned the flames.

It’s an ominous sign for the rest of the American West, where the fire season tends to start later, but where conditions are similarly primed to burn.

In New Mexico, Fires Started Earlier and Grew Stronger Than in Previous Years The cumulative amount of fire activity detected by satellites in the state, by year. 3,000 fire detections 2022 2,000 2012 ​ 2011 ​ 1,000 All other years since 2003 Nov.

Detections may include the same fire over multiple days in areas that are burning persistently.

New Mexico’s largest and most destructive blaze has burned for nearly two months, alone consuming more than 315,000 acres of land — an area about the size of the city of Los Angeles.

Known as the Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon fire, the massive blaze has forced waves of evacuations from the outskirts of Las Vegas, N.M., a small city about an hour’s drive east of Santa Fe, and other mostly rural communities in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The fire, which started as two separate blazes that later merged, has damaged or destroyed more than 350 homes and other buildings so far, but no lives have been lost. Both blazes were caused by prescribed burns.

Propelled by strong winds, warm temperatures and low humidity, the combined fire moved quickly through dry, overgrown forests and grasslands. Fire crews fought to slow its advance, but the inferno’s fast pace and extreme behavior often hampered their containment efforts. On the gustiest days, which saw winds reach up to 80 miles per hour, firefighting planes and helicopters had to be grounded and crews were prevented from reaching the front lines.

“When the conditions line up like they did, you don’t have a lot of options,” said Rick Young, an incident commander for the Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon fire. All you can do, he added, is “get people out of the way.”

Similar conditions have fueled wildfires across New Mexico. The Black fire in Gila National Forest exploded in mid-May to become the second largest blaze burning in the state. It has continued to grow, forcing nearby evacuations as recently as this weekend. Another large springtime wildfire near the village of Ruidoso in the south of the state, which has since been contained, destroyed or damaged more than 200 structures and left two people dead.

But the sheer size of the Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon fire has stood out. It is the largest fire in the United States so far this year and the largest ever recorded in New Mexico.

Calmer winds and wet weather over the past week, which even included some snow, helped firefighters stop the progression of the blaze. They continued to hold the fire in check through Memorial Day weekend, even as higher-risk fire weather returned.

A ‘Perfect Recipe’ for Explosive Fires

This spring, the risk factors aligned for an extreme fire season in New Mexico, said Park Williams, an associate professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies long-term drought trends and the effects of climate change.

Much of the state saw its driest or near-driest April on record. Springtime temperatures were above average, too.

Those conditions, typical for the Southwest during a La Niña climate pattern, added to longer-term risks: forests left overcrowded and unhealthy by decades of aggressive fire suppression; a mega-drought that created a tinder-dry landscape; and the background warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels and other human activity.

Add high winds to the mix and you have “the perfect recipe for extreme wildfire,” Dr. Williams said.

Long-term drought and warmer-than-usual temperatures have contributed to increased fire risk across much of the Western United States in recent years. And large, destructive wildfires have become more common, especially in California. As the climate has warmed, traditional fire seasons have been expanding too — starting earlier and ending later in many parts of the world.

This year in New Mexico, major fires began burning three to five weeks earlier than they normally do, according to an analysis of satellite data.

Fighting Fire With Fire

The Hermits Peak fire began in early April when a prescribed burn by the U.S. Forest Service grew out of control. Prescribed burns are intentionally set by experts to clear out overcrowded forests, improving their health and removing excess fuels that could feed a larger wildfire.

But erratic afternoon winds propelled this burn beyond the reach of firefighters. By mid-April, the blaze had grown to more than 6,000 acres, threatening homes and triggering evacuations.

The Calf Canyon fire ignited nearby later that month and soon merged forces with the Hermits Peak blaze. On Friday, investigators announced that the Calf Canyon fire was also caused by a planned burn conducted earlier this year. The “sleeper fire” had lain dormant since late January, surviving several winter snowfalls, before roaring back to life in April.

The megafire has raised concerns about the use of prescribed burns in the state, with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham calling on the Forest Service to “take a hard look at their fire management practices and make sure they account for a rapidly changing climate.”

Citing “current extreme wildfire risk conditions in the field,” the Forest Service on May 20 temporarily suspended all prescribed fire operations across the country for 90 days pending a review of best practices.

“The U.S.D.A. Forest Service is committed to conducting prescribed fire under safe conditions,” said Michelle Burnett, a representative for the agency, noting that in the vast majority of cases prescribed fires go as planned. “In rare circumstances, conditions change, and prescribed burns move outside the planned project area and become wildfires. It is imperative that we learn from these experiences.”

Fire ecologists and other experts supported the safety review but stressed that prescribed burns remain crucial tools for forest management and usually help reduce the risk of major wildfires. The fact that some can escape control and grow wildly, they argued, is evidence of how primed the whole system is to burn.

“Many of these forests, naturally speaking, are adapted to burn,” said Blanca Cespedes, a fire ecologist at New Mexico Highlands University in Las Vegas, a city threatened by the Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon blaze. “Fire suppression policies have allowed us to live in this territory, but also created a forest that is hyper-dense in fuels” — and able to burn at a more catastrophic scale.

Owen Burney, director of New Mexico State University’s John T. Harrington Forestry Research Center, said that improving the health of forests is crucial to relieving the growing wildfire danger across the Western United States.

“There’s a huge amount of work ahead of us,” Dr. Burney said, “both on the front end to make sure we won’t have these destructive fires and on the tail end knowing we’ll have some and have to restore the land.”

1584,2021-05-25,The Central California Town That Keeps Sinking,"When farmers fail to get enough surface water from local rivers or from canals that bring Northern California river water into the San Joaquin Valley, they turn to what is known as groundwater — the water beneath the Earth’s surface that must be pumped out. They have done so for generations.

Corcoran’s situation is not unique. In Texas, the Houston-Galveston area has been sinking since the 1800s. Parts of Arizona, Louisiana and New Jersey have dealt with subsidence problems. The foundations of Mexico City churches have famously tilted, and one 2012 study found that Venice was subsiding at a rate of .07 inches per year.

But how Corcoran came to dip nearly 12 feet in more than a decade is a tale not of land but of water, and the ways in which, in ag-dominated Central California, water is power — so much so that many residents and local leaders downplay the town’s sinkage or ignore it entirely. Few in Corcoran are eager to criticize agricultural companies that provide jobs in a struggling region for helping to cause a little-known geological problem no one can see.

“It’s a risk for us,” said Mary Gonzales-Gomez, a lifelong Corcoran resident and chairwoman of the Kings County Board of Education. “We all know that, but what are we going to do? There’s really nothing that we can do. And I don’t want to move.”

The Interior Department had asked the states to voluntarily come up with a plan by Jan. 31 to collectively cut the amount of water they draw from the Colorado. The demand for those cuts, on a scale without parallel in American history, was prompted by precipitous declines in Lake Mead and Lake Powell, which provide water and electricity for Arizona, Nevada and Southern California. Drought, climate change and population growth have caused water levels in the lakes to plummet.

“Think of the Colorado River Basin as a slow-motion disaster,” said Kevin Moran, who directs state and federal water policy advocacy at the Environmental Defense Fund. “We’re really at a moment of reckoning.”

Sixty-seven million olive trees are planted on every hill and valley, alongside every highway and road, in every direction. It has been called the largest man-made forest on earth.

1589,2022-12-23,Why can a warming climate increase snowfall?,"It can seem counterintuitive that on a warming planet, winter storms can produce so much snow. But it’s actually a fairly logical consequence of climate change’s intensifying effect on the earth’s water cycle.

More extreme precipitation events — snow as well as rain — are “exactly what we expect in a warming world,” said Rick Thoman, a climate specialist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

As the planet warms, so do both the oceans and the atmosphere. Warmer oceans increase the amount of water that evaporates into the air, and warmer air can hold more water vapor, which it eventually releases as precipitation.

Overall, winter temperatures are warming, and the length of the winter season is shortening. Warmer temperatures mean that more of that precipitation will fall as rain rather than snow, according to Sean Birkel, climatologist for the state of Maine. But some places could still see more snowfall than before, when rising temperatures are still below the freezing point.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,0.9528,[],[]

To build Hoover Dam in the 1930s, an army of Depression-era daredevils poured enough concrete to form a two-lane road from Seattle to Miami. The dam powered Los Angeles and birthed modern Las Vegas. Downriver canals made Arizona habitable year-round, delivered cold water to drinking fountains in Disneyland and created an Eden for winter vegetables in Southern California.

Humans bent nature to their will to shape a civilization in an arid land. Now, human activity — the accelerant of climate change — is threatening those dreams. Lake Mead, the big man-made body of water behind the dam, has sunk to near its lowest level since it was filled, signaling ripples of change in the world made possible by the backed-up Colorado River.

You may think you’ve seen this movie before: the parched and elaborately plumbed West crying for relief.

1603,2022-06-21,Indoor Farming Is a ‘No-Brainer.’ Except for the Carbon Footprint.,"The advantages of controlled agriculture, a technology pioneered in the Netherlands, are many. Crops are not subject to the vagaries of extreme weather, such as frost, heat or hail; they will never be recalled because of E. coli contamination from the dairy farm upstream; and produce can be bred for flavor instead of for tolerance to heat, rain and long-distance transportation.

Furthermore, these greenhouses can produce more food with fewer pesticides and less water. With computer-controlled root and air temperatures, nutrients and carbon dioxide levels, these plants are grown in nutrient-laden water rather than soil and provide yields up to 400 times greater per acre than field agriculture, with one-tenth the water used. Controlled agriculture also allows vegetable farms to operate where there is no arable land, whether in Kentucky coal country or an Egyptian desert.

A vast majority of the more than 2,300 controlled environment greenhouses in the United States — 100-acre structures or smaller vertical farms that grow crops on trays stacked to the ceiling — replace the warmth and light from the sun with fossil-fuel power, giving a new meaning to the term “greenhouse gas.” While there are efforts to make controlled agriculture more energy efficient — such as siting greenhouses adjacent to power or water treatment plants (or even server farms) to capture the waste heat those facilities generate — even greenhouses that use renewable electricity sources for lighting generally use natural gas for heating because it’s far more cost-effective.

The carbon footprint of any given greenhouse tomato, the leading indoor crop, can vary quite a bit, depending on energy sources, ambient temperatures and available natural light. But various studies conducted in the United States, Europe and Canada have estimated that, on average, the production of a pound of tomatoes in an American or Northern European greenhouse using fossil-fuel energy releases 3 to 3.5 pounds of carbon into the atmosphere.

That is, these studies suggest, about six times the carbon footprint of field tomatoes, even after taking into account the diesel emissions from refrigerated trucks that often transport field vegetables hundreds or even thousands of miles to reach consumers.

“It has been both an unusually dry and an unusually wet winter,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Nature Conservancy.

But what do these ups and downs mean for California’s next fire season? The answer is complicated.

Before October, a vast majority of California was considered to be in “exceptional” or “extreme” drought (the highest rankings, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor). So when meteorological conditions known as “atmospheric rivers” drenched parts of the state in October and December, much of that water was sucked up by the parched landscape.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.8647,['United States'],['Los Angeles']

This is great news for a state that was mired in extreme drought and struggling to survive off reduced water supplies for years.

“I think everybody is thrilled,” said Laura Ramos, interim director of research and education at the California Water Institute at Cal State Fresno.

Why do these water systems matter?

1606,2021-06-23,A Shift on Climate for Some G.O.P. Leaders,"Some Republicans call for a coherent climate strategy

For years young Republicans have been telling their party that the G.O.P.’s denial of climate change was unacceptable. Party leaders are finally starting to listen.

Earlier this month conservatives held a rally for climate action in Miami. In Utah, a group of 29 state lawmakers issued a call for a price on carbon dioxide emissions, the most prevalent planet-warming gas. New think tanks that cater to conservatives who want to work on climate change are emerging. In Congress, the Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California is poised in coming weeks to announce a new task force aimed at developing Republican climate legislation. And today Representative John Curtis, a Republican from Utah, announced the formation of a new Conservative Climate Caucus aimed at educating party members about warming.

Why it matters: Republicans who have worked for years to steer their party in a new direction on climate change are calling the shift significant, saying it shows the party is done with denial and is ready to debate solutions. As Alex Flint, director of Alliance for Market Solutions, a conservative group that advocates a price on carbon, told me: “For two decades there were virtually no Republicans responsibly engaged on climate change. What you’re seeing today is the construction of the policymaking apparatus on the right in the climate space.”

The question is, what Republicans will do with this newfound attention to climate change.

1607,2025-01-09,Scientists Say Musk Wrongly Downplays Climate Role in L.A. Fires,"Elon Musk on Thursday inserted himself into the debate over the role climate change plays in wildfires as at least five fires scorched the Los Angeles area, charring entire neighborhoods, killing at least five people and forcing tens of thousands to flee.

“Climate change risk is real, just much slower than alarmists claim,” Mr. Musk wrote to his 211 million followers on X, the social media site he owns. He said the loss of homes was “primarily due” to “nonsensical overregulation” and “bad governance at the state and local level that resulted in a shortage of water.”

But scientists are clear: A warming planet, driven largely by the burning of fossil fuels, has created the conditions for increasingly destructive wildfires, along with more damaging hurricanes and other extreme weather.

Studies have found that extreme wildfires are getting more frequent and more intense, and fires are spreading faster, too.

“Wildfires have become larger and more frequent because of climate change in the Western part of the United States,” said Michael F. Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Regarding Mr. Musk’s comments, he said, “I find the whole thing pretty alarming.”

Scientists are unable to say with certainty that any single weather event was caused by global warming. But coming off the hottest year in history, the Los Angeles area has received less rainfall since the start of the rainy season in October than almost any other year since record-keeping began in 1877.

That drought turned vegetation into ready kindling, and temperatures have been above normal, further drying out grasses and scrubs. At the same time, Santa Ana winds have been unusually ferocious, blowing as fast as 100 miles per hour.

Benjamin Hatchett, a fire meteorologist at the University of Colorado, said there have been dry starts in past years but the combination of drought and high winds is fueling more destruction.

“This is probably just a bad, unfortunate, confluence of events,” Mr. Hatchett said. “I would be very hesitant to immediately say this is climate change and I don’t think that’s the right message here.

But because of climate change, he said, “this is the kind of conditions we expect to see more of going into the future.”

President-elect Donald J. Trump, Mr. Musk and other Republicans have sought to politicize the wildfires, using it as a way to attack Democratic officeholders in California. Mr. Trump in particular has seized on environmental regulations, including federal and state protections for California’s endangered delta smelt fish. He falsely claimed that those regulations led to inadequate water availability for firefighting efforts.

Peter Gleick, co-founder of the Pacific Institute, a California research organization that focuses on water, said Mr. Trump was spouting “complete nonsense.”

“There’s no link between California’s water policies and efforts to protect endangered species and water availability for firefighters,” Mr. Gleick said. “They’re completely unrelated.""

He noted that Southern California reservoir levels, including ones that feed Los Angeles, are above normal for this time of year. “There’s no water shortage,” he said. “The real issue is that urban water systems are not built or designed to fight massive, urban wildfires.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,news analysis,0,0,0,-0.9815,['United States'],"['Los Angeles', 'Santa Ana', 'Colorado']"

But they all call, in one way or another, for rich countries and private creditors to offer debt relief, so countries can use those funds to transition away from fossil fuels, adapt to the effects of climate change, or obtain financial reward for the natural assets they already protect, like forests and wetlands. One widely circulated proposal calls on the Group of 20 (the world’s 20 biggest economies) to require lenders to offer relief “in exchange for a commitment to use some of the newfound fiscal space for a green and inclusive recovery.”

On the other side of the world from Belize, the low-lying Pacific island nation of Fiji has experienced a succession of storms in recent years that brought destruction and the need to borrow money to rebuild. The pandemic brought an economic downturn. In December, tropical cyclone Yasa destroyed homes and crops. Fiji’s debts soared, including to China, and the country, whose very existence is threatened by sea level rise, pared back planned climate projects, according to research by the World Resources Institute.

The authors proposed what they called a climate-health-debt swap, where bilateral creditors, namely China, would forgive some of the debt in exchange for climate and health care investments. (China has said nothing publicly about the idea of debt swaps.)

And then there’s Mozambique. The sixth-poorest country in the world.

It was already sinking under huge debts, including secret loans that the government had not disclosed, when, in 2019, came back-to-back cyclones.

But the scarcity of water is also pushing developers to innovate with design and install expensive infrastructure to save fresh water and recycle more wastewater.

A deep drought has settled on the Southwest since 2000, exacerbated by climate change. Water flow has dropped precipitously in the Colorado River and other surface water supplies that serve Arizona and its neighboring states. That is putting more pressure to supply homes and businesses from finite water reserves held in aquifers.

The consequences are being felt across the West. A proposal for a new water pipeline to supply St. George, Utah, has become the focus of public opposition. Communities in Colorado and Utah have declared moratoriums on new developments. And water supply is one reason that rural residents are fighting a proposal to increase the density of homes in Washoe County, Nev.

In Arizona, groundwater levels are falling so fast that thousands of residential wells all over the state are going dry. In 2021, the Arizona Department of Water Resources halted new-home construction in Pinal County, south of Phoenix, because groundwater pumping exceeded the supply.

In New Mexico, two proposals for big planned communities outside Albuquerque have languished because of concerns over water. At one project, Campbell Farming proposed building 4,000 homes, a commercial and retail center and two golf courses on 8,000 acres in the mountains east of the city more than two decades ago, according to planning documents, but it faced objections to groundwater use, which would total about 400 million to 500 million gallons annually. The Office of the State Engineer found that Campbell Ranch would not meet a New Mexico requirement for developers to demonstrate that their projects had a 70-year supply of water.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,0.8628,['Mexico'],"['George', 'Colorado', 'Phoenix', 'Albuquerque']"
1614,2023-09-25,‘Monster Fracks’ Are Getting Far Bigger. And Far Thirstier.,"Dallas TEXAS Austin Houston San Antonio Dallas TEXAS Austin Houston San Antonio TEXAS TEXAS Amarillo Lubbock Dallas El Paso TEXAS Austin Houston San Antonio Corpus Christi UNCHARTED WATERS ‘Monster Fracks’ Are Getting Far Bigger. And Far Thirstier. Giant new oil and gas wells that require astonishing volumes of water to fracture bedrock are threatening America’s fragile aquifers. Increasingly complex oil wells are sweeping across Texas, birthplace of the fracking revolution, and the nation. Fracking sites A Times analysis found that these new wells can consume millions of gallons of water, often taken from dwindling aquifers. Texas aquifers To satisfy that thirst, energy giants are drilling not just for oil, but for the water they need. Water wells that supply fracking Nationwide, fracking has used up nearly 1.5 trillion gallons of water since 2011. That’s how much tap water the entire state of Texas uses in a year.

Along a parched stretch of La Salle County, Texas, workers last year dug some 700 feet deep into the ground, seeking freshwater. Millions of gallons of it.

The water wouldn’t supply homes or irrigate farms. It was being used by the petroleum giant BP to frack for fossil fuels. The water would be mixed with sand and toxic chemicals and pumped right back underground — forcing oil and gas from the bedrock.

It was a reminder that to strike oil in America, you need water. Plenty of it.

Today, the insatiable search for oil and gas has become the latest threat to the country’s endangered aquifers, a critical national resource that is already being drained at alarming rates by industrial farming and cities in search of drinking water.

The amount of water consumed by the oil industry, revealed in a New York Times investigation, has soared to record levels. Fracking wells have increased their water usage sevenfold since 2011 as operators have adopted new techniques to first drill downward and then horizontally for thousands of feet. The process extracts more fossil fuels but requires enormous amounts of water.

Together, oil and gas operators reported using about 1.5 trillion gallons of water since 2011, much of it from aquifers, the Times found. Fracking a single oil or gas well can now use as much as 40 million gallons of water or more.

These mega fracking projects, called “monster fracks” by researchers, have become the industry norm. They barely existed a decade ago. Now they account for almost two out of every three fracking wells in Texas, the Times analysis found.

“They’re the newcomers, a new sector that burst onto the scene and is heavily reliant on the aquifers,” said Peter Knappett, an associate professor in hydrogeology at Texas A&M University, referring to fracking companies. “And they could be pumping for several decades from aquifers that are already over-exploited and already experiencing long-term declines.”

Fracking, which is shorthand for hydraulic fracturing, has transformed the global energy landscape, turning America into the world’s largest oil and gas producer, surpassing Saudi Arabia. Supporters say it has strengthened America’s national security and created valuable jobs.

But fracking has long been controversial. The process of cracking the bedrock by injecting chemical-laced water into the ground can lead to spills and leaks and can affect the local geology, sometimes contributing to earthquakes. Critics of fracking say it is an irony that so much water is being diverted to produce fossil fuels, given that the burning of fossil fuels is causing climate change, further straining freshwater resources.

The Times documented the surging water usage by examining an industry database in which energy companies report the chemicals they pump into the ground while fracking. But the database also includes details on their water usage, revealing the dramatic growth.

The problem is particularly acute in Texas, where the state’s groundwater supply is expected to drop one-third by 2070. As the planet warms, scientists have predicted that Texas will face higher temperatures and more frequent and intense droughts, along with a decline in groundwater recharge. Some experts have warned that water issues could even constrain oil and gas production.

In the western portion of the Eagle Ford, one of the state’s major oil-producing regions, aquifer levels have fallen by up to 58 feet a year, a 2020 study by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin found, and fracking’s water demands could result in further regional declines of up to 26 feet.

Since 2011, BP has dug at least 137 groundwater wells in Texas for its oil and gas operations and reported using 9.1 billion gallons of water nationally during the past decade. EOG, one of the country’s largest frackers, consumed more than 73 billion gallons of water for fracking at the same time. Apache Corporation, Southwestern Energy, Chevron, Ovintiv and other major operators also have intensified water usage, the Times analysis found.

Oil companies require no permits to drill their own groundwater wells and there is no consistent requirement that groundwater used for fracking be reported or monitored. As drought has gripped Texas and the surrounding region, many communities have instituted water restrictions for residents even as fracking has been allowed to continue unabated.

Pockets of public resistance are emerging. In New Mexico, a coalition of tribes and environmental groups is suing the state, saying that fracking companies are using up precious water resources and that the state has failed to protect the interests of residents. In Colorado, residents are fighting a proposed fracking project they fear would not just use up local freshwater resources, but risk contaminating a reservoir their community depends on.

Holly Hopkins, an executive at the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said the industry was “focused on meeting the growing demand for affordable, reliable energy while minimizing impacts on the environment.” Its members, she said, were “continuing to develop innovative methods to reuse and recycle” water used for fracking.

In a statement, Apache said 80 percent of the water it used for fracking was either non-fresh or recycled from previous fracks. BP said it was “executing several pilot projects to recycle water” that would “minimize freshwater usage.”

​​Chevron said that water was vital to its operations and that it aimed to use water efficiently and responsibly, saying that it used brackish or recycled water for fracking. Southwestern and Ovintiv did not respond to requests for comment.

“You just have to hope,” said Ronald T. Green, a hydrologist for La Salle County. Sergio Flores for The New York Times

In La Salle County — where workers were drilling the water well last year that would supply BP — the local aquifers have already been strained by decades of pumping to feed crops and cattle. The local groundwater district, Wintergarden, estimates that fracking’s water needs could surpass those of irrigation by 2030 (though the oil industry’s notorious boom-and-bust cycles could change that).

Despite the new demand, Wintergarden has little say over the use of water for fracking.

According to its rules, when “moderate” or “severe” droughts occur, people should stop washing their cars and restaurants should refrain from serving glasses of water unless a customer asks. But only during “exceptional” droughts do the rules extend to fracking, and even then they merely discourage it.

Similarly in Laredo, a city on the Mexican border that recently imposed water restrictions, residents may water their lawns only three days a week, and only at night. Laredo, which in recent years has become fracking territory, is facing an impending water shortage: By 2040, it’s expected to exhaust the available supply of municipal water from the Rio Grande allocated to the city every year. Still, even during severe drought, fracking is excluded from city or state restrictions.

“This is Texas. If you’re using water for oil and gas, it’s considered exempt,” said Ronald T. Green, a hydrologist who advises Wintergarden. So when fracking plans collide with drought, Dr. Green said, “you just have to hope that if they’re a good, community-oriented company, they might decide not to frack that well till next year.”

It’s happening, of course, because there is money to be made in oil. And for those with access to water, it can be easy money.

Bruce Frasier grows onions in Dimmit, one of the three counties that make up the Wintergarden water district. But he also sells groundwater to a local fracking company for 50 cents a barrel. Given the growing size of fracks, “If you’ve got the water to sell, you’re making a fortune,” Mr. Frasier said.

THE ‘HORIZONTAL’ FRACK

“You could just dig, and the water would flow,” said Bill Martin, a rancher. Sergio Flores for The New York Times

Wintergarden. Evergreen. Big Springs.

The place names that dot Texas’s parched plains hark back to a time more than a century ago when groundwater was plentiful.

“Back in those days, you could just dig, and the water would flow,” said Bill Martin, a rancher and farmer who heads the Wintergarden Groundwater Conservation District, as he walked his land during a recent heat wave, his boots kicking up dust under a scorching sun.

But that water, sometimes called fossil water because scientists estimate that it pooled underground as long as 30,000 years ago, started to dry up as farms irrigated vast tracts of land. Farms that couldn’t afford to drill ever deeper started to plant less or shut down.

Today, much of America’s oil and gas comes from parched land like this. And now, fracking companies are the ones scrambling for water. A 2016 Ceres report found that nearly 60 percent of the 110,000 wells fracked between 2011 and 2016 were in regions with high or extremely high water stress, including basins in Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, and California.

This is partly because of the increasing complexity and size of fracked wells. For example one technique, horizontal drilling, involves wells that stretch thousands of feet sideways, not just downward. In the Permian Basin, average well length grew to more than 10,000 feet in the first nine months of 2022, compared with less than 4,000 feet in 2010, federal data shows.

It is because water is so fundamental to fracking that the longer wells typically require far more water.

“As the easier-to-extract areas are tapped to their full potential, you need to use more and more desperate measures,” said A.J. Kondash, an environmental scientist at RTI International, a nonprofit research organization, who has studied fracking’s water use.

The problem is actually two-fold. Fracking companies are pulling more water out of the ground, and then, after the fracking process, they must treat or dispose of millions of gallons of contaminated water, removing it from the natural water cycle.

Some companies are making strides in reusing that fracking wastewater to drill for more oil and gas, but it’s a small percentage. In the sprawling Permian Basin in Texas, the largest oil field in the country, just 15 percent of water used for fracking is recycled water, according to state estimates.

The Times based its water-use analysis on data from FracFocus, a registry of chemicals used in fracking that is operated by two national associations of state agencies, the Groundwater Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission. In 27 states, companies report the data to FracFocus.

That data revealed surging water use even though the numbers, which are self-reported by industry, are sometimes incomplete.

Note: The Times analyzed water use by 20 of the companies that have the largest fracking well counts nationwide. Listed here are the Top 5 major companies by median volume of water used per frack. Source: FracFocus chemical disclosure database as of Aug. 1, 2023

Dan Yates, executive director of the Groundwater Protection Council, pointed out that the two agencies that run FracFocus have no regulatory authority. The onus is on individual states, he said, to make sure operators disclose timely and accurate data.

Rystad Energy, an energy research company, estimated that about 6 to 9 percent of fracked wells don’t get reported to FracFocus.

Of course, water use by energy industries isn’t limited to fracking. Water is important in oil refining and the cooling of power plants, and also plays a role in the mining of lithium and other minerals essential in the transition to cleaner energy.

Oil companies say the industry uses substantial amounts of brackish water not suitable for drinking, though there is little systematic tracking of how much. They also say that drilling fewer, longer wells reduces environmental disruption at ground level.

Industry groups also stress that oil and gas production uses a small fraction of the water required by other activities, like irrigated agriculture.

But researchers at Colorado State University who compared water used for fracking in oil- and gas-producing states between 2011 and 2020 found that, under arid conditions, frackers could use more water than irrigation. In La Salle for instance, under arid conditions, fracking used more water than irrigation and local homes and businesses combined. Fracking activity, they found, responded to oil prices, and seemed largely unresponsive to droughts or water restrictions.

Compounding the problem, about a quarter of Texas operates under rules that let landowners pump as much water on their property as they like, regardless of consequences to neighbors.

“In Texas, if you own the surface, you own everything to the center of the earth,” said Mr. Martin of the Wintergarden water district.

THE HUNT FOR WATER

Mario Atencio’s home abuts a fracking site. Sharon Chischilly for The New York Times

The letter from an oil company arrived for Mario Atencio’s family in 2013, promising riches in exchange for a lease to drill near their home in northwestern New Mexico.

Then, Enduring Resources, the Denver-based oil and gas company that ultimately acquired the lease, started to drill.

Workers dug a water well near the area where his family raises livestock, tapping into the groundwater that had long sustained the grazing land the Atencios use to raise goats and sheep. “They came in and they put in water pipelines. Huge pools filled with water,” Mr. Atencio said. “We thought, ‘Is this our water? How much water are they tapping?’”

Mr. Atencio, a leader in the local Navajo Nation Chapter, is now part of the coalition of tribes and environmental organizations that in May sued New Mexico alleging that the state had failed to protect its residents from the harms of fracking.

A substantial portion of their complaint focuses on the strain that oil and gas development places on freshwater in New Mexico, one of the nation’s most water-stressed states.

“We’re facing some of the worst years of drought in the last 1,200 years,” said Julia Bernal of the Pueblo Action Alliance, an Indigenous organization that is a party to the lawsuit. Yet energy companies were building water pipelines to serve fracking sites, she said. “There are a lot of families that live in the region that don’t have access to running water.”

New Mexico said it “vigorously disagrees” with the lawsuit’s allegations and was proud of its work regulating oil and gas. Enduring Resources didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Across the country, investments like these in water for oil and gas — wells, pipelines and even water distribution companies — are extensive and spreading.

In Colorado, the energy exploration companies Anadarko and Noble Energy have invested tens of millions of dollars in freshwater pipelines and have created companies to sell and distribute water for fracking. In 2020, Chevron acquired Noble Energy, together with its water business, in a transaction worth more than $13 billion.

When Kevin Chan moved to Colorado from California last year, to a neighborhood on the banks of the Aurora Reservoir, he said he was surprised to learn that more than 150 horizontal fracked wells were planned in the region around the reservoir. The wells would potentially require a total of 3.9 billion gallons of freshwater from a local water district and other sources, according to the energy company behind the project, Denver-based Civitas.

Concerned about the water use and risk of oil spills, he formed a community group, Save the Aurora Reservoir, to oppose the plan. In moving to Colorado, “I was drawn to the proximity to the mountains, being able to go snowboarding,” Mr. Chan said. “I didn’t expect to go up against a multibillion dollar industry.”

Rich Coolidge, a spokesman for Civitas, said several thousand feet of rock separated the Aurora reservoir from oil and gas production. He said the company was working with local water providers that sell surplus supply, but declined to give details.

Some local governments are starting to take action. In 2020, New Mexico halted sales of water supplies to oil and gas companies fracking on state land. This year, Colorado passed a bill requiring frackers to greatly increase their reuse of fracking wastewater. In May, Texas passed a bill designed to find more uses for fracking wastewater.

But cleaning up that wastewater, which contains hazardous chemicals, is costly and energy-intensive. Even if frackers were able to re-use their treated wastewater for all their production, the industry estimates it would still generate hundreds of millions of gallons of excess every day. And the diversion of fracking wastewater to other uses, whether for agriculture or to mist roadways in order to keep down the dust, remains contentious because of safety concerns.

So, in states like Texas, it remains cheaper to use groundwater.

Mr. Martin, the rancher and farmer who heads the Wintergarden water district, doesn’t fault energy companies for that. He himself irrigates his cantaloupe fields using groundwater.

Still, as he contemplated a future of ever-dwindling aquifers, he struck a somber tone. “If the water goes away, the whole community goes away,” he said.

1619,2023-10-24,Inside Poland Spring’s Hidden Attack on Water Rules It Didn’t Like,"When Maine lawmakers tried to tighten regulations on large-scale access to water, the brand’s little-known parent company set out to rewrite the rules.

When Maine lawmakers tried to rein in large-scale access to the state’s freshwater this year, the effort initially gained momentum. The state had just emerged from drought, and many Mainers were sympathetic to protecting their snow-fed lakes and streams.

Then a Wall Street-backed giant called BlueTriton stepped in.

BlueTriton isn’t a household name, but its products are. Americans today buy more bottled water than any other packaged drink, and BlueTriton owns many of the nation’s biggest brands, including Poland Spring, which is named after a natural spring in Maine that is no longer commercially viable.

Maine’s bill threatened BlueTriton’s access to the groundwater it bottles and sells. The legislation had already gotten a majority vote on the committee and was headed toward the full Legislature, when a lobbyist for BlueTriton proposed an amendment that would gut the entire bill.

“Strike everything,” starts the proposed amendment, which was written in a Word document that contained a digital signature showing that it had been created by Elizabeth M. Frazier, who represents BlueTriton and is one of the most influential lobbyists in Maine. The document was emailed by Ms. Frazier to lawmakers in the days after the committee vote.

The BlueTriton bottling plant in Poland Spring, Maine, this month.

After BlueTriton’s intervention, the committee pulled the bill back. The company’s actions, which haven’t previously been reported, were described to The New York Times by three state legislators. The Times also reviewed several of the emails sent by Ms. Frazier as well as the Word document.

“We couldn’t believe it. Their amendment strikes the entire bill,” said Christopher Kessler, a Democratic state representative who represents South Portland and a committee member who voted to advance the bill. “Because all this happened behind closed doors, the public doesn’t know that Poland Spring stalled the process.”

His panel, the Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology, plans to meet on Wednesday to discuss the fate of the bill.

Bottlers have faced increasing scrutiny for the millions of throwaway plastic bottles they produce, the marketing message that their products are safer or healthier than tap water, and for a business model in which they buy freshwater, often at low cost, only to sell it back to the public at much higher prices.

And while the bottled-water business doesn’t use nearly as much groundwater as the nation’s thirstiest industries, like agriculture, the pressure on bottlers is building as awareness grows of the stress that intensive pumping can place on local water supplies. A Times investigation this year revealed that many of the aquifers that supply 90 percent of the nation’s water systems are being severely depleted as overuse and global warming transform fragile ecosystems.

BlueTriton has been caught up in issues of local opposition and water use, and not only in Maine. The company also is fighting for access to water sources in numerous states, including Michigan, Colorado and others.

In response to detailed questions, BlueTriton on Monday pointed The Times to a new page on its corporate website. “After thoughtful consideration, BlueTriton opposes the proposed legislation,” the page says, because the bill “would make it unaffordable for any large-scale water purchaser, including Poland Spring, to invest in infrastructure and operations.”

Ms. Frazier didn’t respond to detailed questions.

Groundwater use is regulated by states, not the federal government, which means there is little national coordination, monitoring or management of a vital natural resource. Maine’s bill seeks, among other things, to put a seven-year limit on contracts for large-scale freshwater pumping by corporations that ship water out of Maine, and to make the deals subject to local approval. That would block BlueTriton’s current efforts to lock in contracts up to 45 years long for pumping water.

The Maine State House in Augusta. “We couldn’t believe it,” State Representative Christopher Kessler said of the lobbying effort.

Industries and other interest groups routinely try to influence lawmaking, and there has been no suggestion that Ms. Frazier violated any rules. But it seemed “unusual procedurally” for a corporation to propose rewriting an entire bill after it had already advanced within the Legislature, said Anthony Moffa, associate professor at the University of Maine School of Law.

State senator Mark Lawrence, a Democrat who heads the committee considering the bill, said the committee would consider amendments proposed by any interested person or party. In Maine, “a lot of the legislation that’s proposed is written by lobbyists, companies, different people like that,” he said.

Mr. Lawrence also said that, at the same time the amendment was proposed, several members had begun to express fresh concerns that the State Legislature would be setting overly stringent curbs on contracts.

Water Clashes Nationwide

BlueTriton finds itself pitted against local water boards, environmentalists and other groups across the country.

In Colorado, environmental groups have been battling a 10-year contract that BlueTriton renewed with a semi-arid county to pump water from the Upper Arkansas River Basin, a region affected by historic drought.

In California, BlueTriton has publicly criticized and vowed to fight a cease-and-desist order issued by the state’s water board to stop diverting millions of gallons of water from a spring in San Bernardino County.

In Michigan, lawmakers have proposed legislation that would close a loophole that enables BlueTriton and other commercial water users to pump water from the protected Great Lakes watershed. Known as the “bottled-water loophole,” it allows for water to be used this way if it’s in containers that are 5.7 gallons or less.

On its new corporate page, BlueTriton said “there is no evidence of adverse impacts to the aquifer” in Colorado, and that California’s ruling “negatively impacts every water agency and farmer in California that relies on groundwater, and in doing so, indirectly harms every Californian.”

BlueTriton is a major presence in Maine, drawing water from eight locations around the state. It is currently trying to lock in a new contract of up to 45 years to pump water in Lincoln, a former mill town.

Water trucks filling up at a Poland Spring facility in Lincoln, Maine.

That would be BlueTriton’s second decades-long contract in the state, the kind of deals that would run afoul of the State Legislature’s proposed seven-year cap. The company’s pursuit of these deals, and the uncertainties of how climate change may affect Maine’s water supplies in the future, is what inspired the legislation, said Margaret M. O’Neil, the Democratic state legislator who introduced the bill.

“We’re seeing our communities get locked into these contracts that are going to last, basically, the rest of my lifetime,” which is too risky, she said, considering climate uncertainties.

In Lincoln, BlueTriton said, the local water district had the right to reduce or suspend sales to Poland Spring to ensure service to customers.

In 2016-17 and in 2020-22, Maine experienced significant drought, followed by wet years. The state has also started seeing what scientists call “snow drought”: As winters warm because of climate change, snowpack and groundwater recharge can dwindle.

John Mullaney, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey’s New England Water Science Center, said that a warming climate meant Maine was likely to experience more variability, with stronger rains but also worsening drought. “The question is, what will we be able to do in 50 years,” he said. “There might be changes that need to be made, including reducing groundwater extraction.”

Industry groups emphasize that Maine still has ample groundwater and that bottled water accounts for only a small portion of its use compared to practices like irrigation. They also stress bottled water’s value in emergencies when drinking water is disrupted.

And in Maine, BlueTriton has a powerful local ally: local water utilities, which say the revenue generated by selling water to bottlers helps keep costs down for everyone else.

“Turning away a customer that’s seeking to pay money to the utility because of an alleged problem with extraction would be contrary” to ratepayers’ interests, said Roger Crouse, who was elected this month to the board of the Maine Water Utilities Association. “If they have a contract that could be expiring in seven years, and the math doesn’t work out, they’re going to have to invest their money somewhere else.”

Still, hydrologists warn that bottled water should not be discounted as an additional strain on aquifers and watersheds, as well as on residential wells. Last month, the United States Geological Survey began its first-ever study of how the activities of the bottled water industry result in changes to groundwater levels, spring flows and water quality. “Withdrawals, no matter what the use, influence movement of groundwater,” Cheryl Dieter, a hydrologist who is leading the study, said in an interview.

The Rise of BlueTriton

BlueTriton is only the latest steward of a brand that dates back more than 150 years.

Poland Spring water was first packaged as a local elixir in the mid-1800s. It bubbled from the ground, and was bottled by the proprietors of a Maine inn.

Today, it embodies a different era.

The original spring is no longer commercially viable and is now encased behind glass in a mausoleum-like structure tucked behind a golf course. But BlueTriton now pumps freshwater from other locations in Maine, the bulk of it shipped out of the state under the Poland Spring label. New York is a major market.

The original Poland Spring water source.

BlueTriton itself is a creation of Wall Street. It is owned by the private equity funds One Rock Capital Partners and Metropoulos & Co., which paid $4.3 billion in 2021 to buy Nestlé’s North American bottled-water business.

Metropoulos grabbed national attention in 2013 when it acquired Hostess, the struggling maker of Twinkies. It turned around the popular sponge cake and sold the company a few years later for a gain of more than $2 billion after slashing costs and jobs.

Private equity firms often look for such deals, involving undervalued or distressed businesses that they can buy using borrowed money and then turn around. The purchase of Nestlé’s bottled-water businesses had some of these elements.

Nestlé said at the time that it was selling because of increasing competition from lower-cost rivals, as well as environmental concerns such as difficulty reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Companies like Nestlé also faced risks to their reputation because of all the plastic waste created by disposable water bottles, which often don’t get recycled.

The company’s private equity roots have raised concerns. In March, the credit rating company Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the BlueTriton’s debt rating, citing its high debt load.

Near BlueTriton’s Poland Spring pumping site.

If and when BlueTriton is sold off by its investors, the county’s water could end up being controlled by “a revolving door of owners,” said John McGowan, a sustainable investing adviser in Chaffee County, Colorado, and member of a group that has been advocating for stricter curbs on the company, which pumps groundwater there.

In Maine, some neighbors of BlueTriton, like Natalie DiPentino, are skeptical of the company for more personal reasons.

Ms. DiPentino, who lives near Lincoln, can’t prove it but wonders if pumping by Poland Spring contributed to a crisis in her home during a drought in 2017, when her well ran dry along with those of several neighbors. Her family had to haul buckets of river water to flush the toilet, she said. Stores nearby ran out of bottled water.

After learning about BlueTriton’s proposed 45-year contract at its Lincoln facility, she led calls for a public hearing, arguing that deals were being cut behind closed doors and that Poland Spring would be paying too little, $15,000 a month, for millions of gallons of water. “You don’t know how badly you need water until you don’t have it in your house,” she said.

The hearing she sought is now scheduled for next month.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,1,0.8833,"['Poland', 'United States']","['New York', 'Elizabeth', 'Michigan', 'San Bernardino', 'Colorado', 'South Portland', 'Lincoln', 'Augusta', 'Spring', 'Lawrence']"
1620,2023-07-30,A Climate Warning from the Cradle of Civilization,"“The marshes are drying,” Mohammed Raed, 19, said as he left them behind, walking his family’s emaciated buffalo toward a neighboring province, where there was still the hope of feeding them.

Mr. Sahlani, the science teacher, said people now eyed their upstream neighbors with suspicion, accusing them of taking more water from the irrigation canals than they’re due and then shutting the sluice gates, leaving too little for residents downstream to grow crops.

Without realizing it, he was describing — on a much smaller scale — Iraq’s standoff with Turkey and Iran, which control much of the Euphrates and the Tigris.

“I understand the problem,” said Ghazwan Abdul Amir, the Iraqi water ministry’s director in Naseriyah, adding that the government was hoping to bring more water to residents in the area.

But water is scarce and money is tight, he said: “Maybe next year.”

Fixing Iraq’s outdated farming techniques, which waste as much as 70 percent of the water used for irrigation, according to a study done for Iraq’s water ministry, is paramount. But persuading farmers to change has been slow going. There were just 120 drip irrigation systems allotted to farmers in Mr. Sahlani’s province last year to save water — and the farmers had to pay for them.

Past the urban sprawl of northern Naseriyah, with its small auto repair shops and vegetable stands, the land empties out. Storm clouds gather in the late afternoon but then disperse without shedding a drop. Tufts of grasses, yellow and brown by late June, offer signs that crops grew here not so long ago.

The wind starts early each morning, blowing ceaselessly until dusk. It strips the topsoil, drying the land until all that is left is an earthen dust that piles on the quickly mounting dunes.

A short drive off the highway, deeper into the desert, lies Al Najim, a village being blown off the map. Thirty years ago, it had 5,000 people. Today there are just 80 left. The temperature hovered at 122 degrees.

Qahatan Almihana, an agricultural engineer, pointed at the town’s landmarks: buildings half-covered in sand, doors buried too deep to open. Sand piled halfway up the walls, poured in the windows and weighed down the roofs.

“That was the school,” he said. The teachers stopped coming in early 2022.

Sheikh Muhammad Ajil Falghus, the head of the Najim tribe, was born in the village. “The land was good, the soil was good,” he explained. Until the early 2000s, he said, “we grew wheat and barley, corn and clover.”

Now, all that grows are small groups of tamarisk trees planted as a bulwark against the sands.

“We are living now on the verge of life,” the sheikh said. “There is no agriculture, no planting possible anymore. This is the end of the line, the end of life.

It was the fourth major heat wave to afflict parts of the West since early June, bringing dangerously hot temperatures and helping fuel the deepening drought and exploding wildfires across the region.

An excessive heat warning will remain in effect for parts of Montana through Tuesday night, according to the National Weather Service. Billings, in the south of the state, reached 106 on Monday while Glasgow, a town toward the north, hit 109 degrees. Temperatures will fall just a few degrees as the week progresses, delivering minimal relief from the sweltering heat.

Salt Lake City hit 104 degrees on Sunday, tying the daily record set in 1960, meteorologists said; it was the 17th time this year that the city hit 100 degrees or higher.

That’s the threshold beyond which scientists say the likelihood of catastrophic impacts increases significantly. The planet has already warmed by about 1.1 degrees Celsius.

Mr. Graham repeated a common refrain among Republicans that it would be foolish for the United States, historically the country that has emitted the most carbon dioxide, to reduce its pollution unless other big polluters like China and India do the same.

“The point to me is to get the world to participate, not just us,” he said.

So it has gone with the Republican Party, where warnings of a catastrophe are mocked as hyperbole, where technologies that do not exist on a viable scale, such as “carbon capture and storage” and “clean coal,” are hailed as saviors. At the same time, those that do, such as wind and solar power and electric vehicles, are dismissed as unreliable and overly expensive. American leadership on a global problem is seen as a fool’s errand, kneecapping the domestic economy while Indian and Chinese coal bury America’s good intentions in soot.

“When China gets our good air, their bad air’s got to move,” Herschel Walker, a former football star and now a Republican candidate in Georgia for the Senate, explained last week. “So it moves over to our good air space. Then now we’ve got to clean that back up.”

1623,2021-11-20,Wildfires in California Killed Thousands of Giant Sequoias,"Three wildfires in California in the past 15 months killed or mortally wounded thousands of mature giant sequoias, accounting for an estimated 13 to 19 percent of the world’s population of the majestic trees, officials said on Friday.

A National Park Service report estimated that two fires in September, sparked by a lighting storm, caused 2,261 to 3,637 mature giant sequoias — or between 3 to 5 percent of the population of mature giant sequoias — to be killed or so severely burned that they were expected to die within five years. Mature giant sequoias have a diameter of more than four feet.

Giant sequoias, which are found on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada in California, can live thousands of years on their way to dwarfing most everything around them. These trees include iconic national treasures like the General Sherman Tree, which is considered the world’s largest tree, standing at 275 feet tall with a diameter of 36 feet at the base.

The death of the trees in staggering numbers is the product of a “deadly combination” of unnaturally dense forests caused by fire suppression that began about 150 years ago and increasingly intense droughts driven by climate change, Clay Jordan, superintendent of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, said in an interview on Friday night.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,3,0,0,-0.8268,['Jordan'],[]

Since then, the skies over New York City, where I live, turned an ominous shade of red because of smoke from wildfires on the other side of the continent. One fire, the Bootleg, was messing with the weather out West. British Columbia declared a state of emergency as wildfires prompted evacuation orders.

Britain’s weather service issued its first-ever extreme heat warning. And in a measure of shock at the level of devastation in one German village particularly hard-hit by last week’s flooding, Chancellor Angela Merkel, said, “the German language has no words, I think, for the devastation.”

More than words, many countries around the world don’t have what it takes to adapt to the extreme weather events battering us.

The agreement, announced Monday, calls for the federal government to pay about $1.2 billion to irrigation districts, cities and Native American tribes in the three states if they temporarily use less water. The states have also agreed to make additional cuts beyond the ones tied to the federal payments to generate the total reductions needed to prevent the collapse of the river.

Taken together, those reductions would amount to about 13 percent of the total water use in the lower Colorado Basin — among the most aggressive ever experienced in the region, and likely to require significant water restrictions for residential and agriculture uses.

The Colorado River supplies drinking water to 40 million Americans in seven states as well as part of Mexico and irrigates 5.5 million acres of farmland.

Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix and its suburbs, gets more than half its water supply from groundwater. Most of the rest comes from rivers and aqueducts as well as recycled wastewater. In practical terms, groundwater is a finite resource; it can take thousands of years or longer to be replenished.

The announcement of a groundwater shortage means Arizona would no longer give developers in some areas of Maricopa County new permits to construct homes that rely on wells for water.

Phoenix and nearby large cities, which must obtain separate permission from state officials for their development plans every 10 to 15 years, would also be denied approval for any homes that rely on groundwater beyond what the state has already authorized.

The decision means cities and developers must look for alternative sources of water to support future development — for example, by trying to buy access to river water from farmers or Native American tribes, many of whom are facing their own shortages. That rush to buy water is likely to rattle the real estate market in Arizona, making homes more expensive and threatening the relatively low housing costs that had made the region a magnet for people from across the country.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,-0.552,[],['Phoenix']

To perform an attribution, scientists use mathematical models to analyze both the world as it is and the world as it might have been, had humans not spent decades pumping planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. With computer simulations, they can replay recent history dozens, even hundreds, of times in both worlds to see how often the event, and others like it, occur in each. The differences indicate how much global warming was likely responsible.

Researchers often perform this comparison using scores of climate models to ensure their conclusions are sound. They also check the simulations against records of actual events that have occurred in the past.

To examine this year’s flooding in Pakistan, the authors of the new study looked at two metrics: the maximum 60-day rainfall each year between June and September over the entire Indus River Basin, and the maximum five-day rainfall each year over the badly hit southern provinces of Sindh and Baluchistan.

The researchers found that several of their models did not realistically reproduce patterns in the actual rainfall data for Pakistan.

But in 2011, a yearslong drought set in. By spring 2015, a local creek had dried up and the valley had gone quiet. “The park went from an extremely vibrant habitat to one that was dead silent,” said Bernie Krause, a soundscape ecologist who has been recording in the park since 1993. “Nothing was singing, nothing was chirping, nothing was moving. It’s like it was dead.”

In the coming years, severe droughts are likely to become more common; as the water dries up, bird song could disappear along with it. It is just one example of how climate change may be altering the planet’s soundscapes, or “breaking Earth’s beat,” as Dr. Krause and his colleagues put it in a paper last year. Dr. Krause, who has amassed more than 5,000 hours of natural recordings for his company, Wild Sanctuary, wrote the paper with Jérôme Sueur, an ecoacoustician at the French National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and Almo Farina, an ecologist at the University of Urbino in Italy.

1631,2021-09-07,Climate Disaster Is the New Normal. Can We Save Ourselves?,"Mitigate, adapt or suffer

Fourteen years ago, a Harvard climate and energy expert, John Holdren, coined a kind of axiom for the three choices climate change posed for humanity: Mitigation — the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions — adaptation and suffering. “We’re going to do some of each,” he said. “The question is what the mix is going to be.”

For years, the policy conversation has rightfully been dominated by the first part of the equation, because, as he explained, “the more mitigation we do, the less adaptation will be required and the less suffering there will be.”

But nations delayed curbing their emissions for so long that global warming is now guaranteed to intensify in the next three decades. And that means that mitigation alone, while still as necessary as ever, is no longer sufficient to prevent suffering: As devastating as recent extreme weather events have been, scientists say the next 30 years will bring even more, hotter heat waves, longer and more intense droughts, and more episodes of catastrophic flooding.

In its 2018 National Climate Assessment, the federal government released a sweeping report of all the ways the United States would need to adapt. Here are just four, courtesy of The Times’s Brad Plumer:

Rethink how we farm: Intensifying drought and extreme heat jeopardizes both the yields of crops and the workers who harvest them. Farmers may have to use more precise irrigation techniques to conserve water, relocate production and invest in climate-controlled buildings.

Build for the future, not the past: The nation’s deteriorating infrastructure — its roads, sewer systems, public transportation, power plants and transmission lines — was built with historical weather conditions in mind, so it can’t just be repaired; it also has to be rebuilt or retrofitted for the weather of the future.

Enlist nature to help: Restoring degraded wetlands and expanding green space can protect cities and coasts from flooding, while planting more trees can reduce urban temperatures and protect people from deadly heat waves.

Expect the unexpected: Earth hasn’t warmed this quickly in tens of millions of years, long before humans even existed. Changes this rapid are likely to bring unpredictable dangers, and the more the world warms, the greater the risk of such surprises, some of which may be irreversible and self-reinforcing.

At the moment, however, there is no national plan for climate adaptation, just as there is no national plan for mitigation. Every year, the federal government spends about $46 billion on recovery from disasters — about seven times what it spends on resilience, as David G. Victor, Sadie Frank and Eric Gesick note in The Times. In many cases, recovery money is spent in ways that increase the risks and costs of climate change by inviting people to build and move into harm’s way.

“When communities are flattened by nature, the nation helps pay for rebuilding — often rebuilding the same infrastructure in the same place, a target for the next disaster,” they write. “Redirecting federal money toward resilience rather than simply rebuilding after disasters will be hard. But the longer we wait, the harder it will become as the costs of climate change mount.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,1,0,0,-0.9556,['United States'],['David']

Over the past century, the river’s flow has averaged about 15 million acre-feet of water a year. But from 2000 through 2022, a period of drought conditions, the average was closer to 12 million acre-feet. And in each of the past three years, it’s been less than 10 million.

The reduced flow in the river has forced major cutbacks for the states that rely on the river to supply water to as many as 40 million residents of the region. The Interior Department had asked those states — California, Nevada, Arizona, Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah — to come up with a plan by today to collectively reduce the amount of water they draw from the Colorado. But the odds of such an agreement materializing appear slim, my colleague Christopher Flavelle reports.

1637,2021-12-10,Here’s Where California Really Uses Its Water,"Take this example: When California was slammed with an atmospheric storm in late October, many of us skipped watering our lawns. After months of water savings of no more than 5 percent compared with last year, Californians’ water usage in October dropped to 13.2 percent below the rate in October 2020, according to new state data. While still short of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 15 percent target, it’s the closest we’ve come.

“This jump in water savings we saw across the state can illustrate just how much water can be conserved when we’re not irrigating outdoors, even for just part of the month,” said Charlotte Ely, who presented the savings data to the State Water Resources Control Board this week.

Half of California’s annual water usage is considered environmental water, meaning it flows through protected rivers or supports wetlands in wildland preserves, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. The other 50 percent is for human use — 40 percent for agriculture and 10 percent for urban use, split between indoor (drinking water, showers) and outdoor (lawns, washing our cars).

But the relatively warm, dry weather in California tips the scales toward outdoor consumption. Plants quickly evaporate water, so keeping them green is more water-intensive than in other parts of the nation, said Jay Lund, co-director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis.

The West Coast is being battered by those three awful cousins, drought, heat and wildfire. When will the hot weather leave certain unforgettable, vertical hikes, like to the top of Half Dome, out of reach?

Yosemite’s last two glaciers are rapidly retreating. They will most likely disappear in a few decades, threatening the summer and autumn water supply in these mountains. By the time I visited in the first week of July, some of the streams in the high country — relied upon by animals and backpackers alike — were already dry. The river that threads through the valley, the Merced, was low and listless. When I lived alongside it years ago, it was so swollen with melted snow and the rapids so loud, I would have to close my window before making a phone call.

The evidence of our planet’s warming is all around us. But many of us have been able to comfort ourselves, if only slightly, with the knowledge that the more cataclysmic fallout is still a ways off, that it may be preventable. Perhaps the gradual nature of the worsening conditions we see every day has lulled us into a sense of complacency.

What I saw in Yosemite feels like a wake-up call that’s come too late.

The park is an international treasure, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and climate change is trashing it. If we can’t even protect protected land, then what about more vulnerable targets of climate catastrophe, like the people we care about?

That Edenic summer so many years ago, stewards like me worried about things that now seem picayune: tourists littering, climbers drilling holes into El Capitan.

1640,2023-12-14,Who Gets the Water in California? Whoever Gets There First.,"UNCHARTED WATERS Who Gets the Water in California? Whoever Gets There First. As the world warms, the state is re-examining claims to its water that have gone unchallenged for generations.

The story of California’s water wars begins, as so many stories do in the Golden State, with gold.

The prospectors who raced westward after 1848 scoured fortunes out of mountainsides using water whisked, manically and in giant quantities, out of rivers. To impose some order on the chaos, the newcomers embedded in the state’s emerging water laws a cherished frontier principle: first come first served. The only requirement for holding on to this privileged status was to keep putting the water to work. In short, use it or lose it.

Their water rights assured, the settlers gobbled up land, laid down dams, ditches, communities. Shrewd barons turned huge estates into jackpots of grain, cattle, vegetables and citrus. California grew and grew and grew, sprouting new engines of wealth along the way: oil, Hollywood, Apple, A.I.

Yet, still today the state is at the mercy of claims to water that were staked more than a century ago, in that cooler, less crowded world. As drought and overuse sap the state’s streams and aquifers, California finds itself haunted by promises, made to generations of farmers and ranchers, of priority access to the West’s most precious resource, with scant oversight, essentially forever.

For many beloved products — nuts and grapes, milk and lettuce — America depends heavily on California. Its farms produce billions of dollars more each year than those in Texas, Nebraska and other states far more defined by agriculture. Water sustains jobs and livelihoods across the state’s economy, which outranks those of all but a handful of nations. Yet in no state does rainfall vary more each year, swinging between deluge and drought in a cycle that global warming is intensifying at both ends.

With so many people, plants and animals competing for this fickle bounty, water fights have shaped California at every stage of development, all the way back to its infancy as a state, when its abundance seemed limitless and settlers took it as their duty to commandeer it. Now, Californians are being forced to confront the limitations of nature’s endowment in new and urgent ways.

And so, to address this most 21st century of crises, a state that prides itself on creating the future is first reckoning with its past.

In the Central Valley, home to some of the nation’s most productive cropland, officials are taking a hard new look at water rights that date back to the 19th century. They are asking farmers to provide historical records to back their claims and using satellite data to size up who is taking river water and how much. A Times analysis of state data identified many growers who reported their use in questionable ways.

In California’s rugged north, regulators are considering throttling supplies to cattle ranchers and other users who for decades have been siphoning too much from the streams, at times in open disregard of the law, worsening a collapse in salmon populations.

And in desert highlands of the Central Coast, the state’s efforts to stop groundwater depletion have spurred two of the world’s largest carrot growers to sue all of their neighboring landowners, big and small, so they can keep pumping.

California has been regulating river flows, however imperfectly, for more than a century. But it didn’t even begin restricting groundwater extraction in a major way until a mere decade ago. Farmers in many areas must now figure out how to stay in business by using less groundwater themselves — or by ensuring their neighbors do.

“The reality is that California had a pretty soft touch in water rights administration” compared with many Western states, said E. Joaquin Esquivel, the chair of the state’s water board, California’s main regulator. “The system worked for as long as it really could.”

Climate change is only deepening the strains on the state’s rivers, which are essential to cities and farms alike. In dry years, less snow is piling up in the mountains to feed them. And more of what does flow downriver ends up evaporating, soaking into parched topsoil or being pulled into the ground as farmers pump out the aquifers.

How California manages could have ramifications well beyond occasional curbs on watering lawns. In the San Joaquin Valley, the Central Valley’s enormous southern half, researchers estimate that more than half a million acres of farmland may need to be taken out of cultivation by 2040 to stabilize the region’s aquifers.

California is hardly the only place where people are reconciling with choices made generations ago about land, water and other shared resources. A Times data investigation this year found groundwater in distress nationwide and exposed a broad failure to address exploitation or even reliably track water use. Yet, few places have wrested such immense riches out of their natural inheritance as California has. New choices about how to share that inheritance might not be able to avoid cutting into one pot of riches or another.

“We can’t fix it without stepping on toes,” said David Webb, who has worked for decades to protect the Shasta River in California’s far north, one of many overworked streams statewide. Come summertime, it’s not unheard of that ranches and farms all but drain the Shasta to a trickle.

Fixing ‘use it or lose it’

Nowhere do the strands of California water history get tangled into trickier knots than in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the vast fertile estuary where the main rivers that nourish the Central Valley pour into the San Francisco Bay, then out to sea.

Mr. Esquivel, the water board’s chair, called the Delta “our most wicked of problems.”

The heart of it is that many of the area’s farms and irrigation districts have been drawing from the Delta’s braided channels for well over a century, before the state even had a water board. This gives them extraordinary privilege in California’s seniority-based system: When there isn’t enough water to go around, they get first dibs. And for a long time, a lot of them didn’t have to provide the state with many details about how much water they actually used.

That is starting to change. Not only is the water board demanding more information from growers on their use, but it’s also starting this year to use satellite analysis that estimates how much evaporates from their fields, a powerful check on farmers’ claims.

All of this is helping the state form a clearer picture of where water goes in the Delta.

Yet growers’ self-reported numbers still contain peculiarities, suggesting that many are probably submitting ballpark estimates rather than precise measurements. The Times analyzed state data from 2010 to 2022 and found that monthly use reports associated with about a quarter of Delta water rights contained a significant share of duplicates — identical numbers, over and over, for months. Sometimes years.

Ed Zuckerman: “We will fight it to our last breath.”

Another issue: Many Delta growers claim not just one water right, but several. California’s use-it-or-lose-it system provides an incentive for them to report using more water than they actually do, or even to count the same use under more than one claimed water right.

Faulty or misleading data can have far-reaching consequences during drought. If lots of growers are double-counting their use, then officials may think less water is available for everybody else than there actually is.

David Weisenberger, the general manager of the Banta-Carbona Irrigation District, which claims rights on the San Joaquin River that date back to 1911, said he double-reported the district’s use for years to avoid losing its water rights.

Recently, he began providing more accurate accounting after the water board’s lawyers assured him that he wouldn’t be forfeiting the district’s rights by doing so. But part of him still worries about future cuts.

“Who knows what they’ll do?” he said on a recent bright morning, driving past neat rows of grapes in his district’s patch of the Delta.

Mr. Weisenberger’s father grew beans and grain in the Central Valley. His grandfather raised cattle. Water disputes used to be handled locally, he said. If someone didn’t think they were getting their rightful share, they would go talk to whoever might be taking too much upriver. Maybe they’d sue.

Neighbors held neighbors accountable, Mr. Weisenberger said, so state officials had no need to know how much water everybody was taking. Today, though, “they’re headed in the direction of ‘God squad’ — they know better than anybody,” he said.

Already in California’s most recent droughts, the board has used new data and analysis techniques to justify deploying aggressive emergency orders to stop thousands of growers in the Delta watershed from taking water. “Emergency regulations don’t leave any room for due process,” Ed Zuckerman, a third-generation Delta farmer, said. “We will fight it to our last breath.”

So far, though, it isn’t the Delta where the board’s efforts have prompted the fiercest complaints. Or the most blatant defiance.

The battle of cattle and salmon

Follow the Sacramento River 200 miles upstream, past its headwaters in the shadow of Mount Shasta, and you start to feel about as far from California’s coastal centers of influence as you would on Mars.

Morning mists hover in the pine-perfumed air. Cattle graze on lush mountain meadows. This is a proudly independent-minded corner of the state, with an on-again, off-again history of trying to secede from it.

It’s here that the water board this year began contemplating a quietly explosive policy: To protect the imperiled salmon that spawn in the Scott and Shasta Rivers, it is considering permanently limiting ranchers’ access to the streams, effectively circumscribing their long-established water rights. The board has done this in both rivers during California’s latest droughts. Now it might restrict their use for good, drought or no drought.

For decades, ranches and farms have been slurping the Shasta and Scott down to small fractions of their natural flows in dry years. Migrations of Chinook and coho salmon have plummeted, harming the Native American communities whose diet and culture center on the fish.

The problem received a burst of fresh attention in the severely dry summer of 2022, when some ranchers in the Shasta Valley flouted state orders to limit water use. To save their herds, they turned on their pumps. The river’s flows quickly dropped by more than half.

For eight days, this continued. And the water board was powerless to do anything but impose its largest possible punishment: a fine of $500 per day of illegal diversion, split between the 80 or so scofflaws. In other words, $50 each, a paltry price to pay.

The ranchers Theodora and Dave Johnson. Chinook salmon in the Scott River. Grazing in the Scott Valley. Tailings near the Scott River, a legacy of gold mining.

In response, state lawmakers have put forth a bill that would increase penalties to $10,000 a day.

Mr. Esquivel, the water board’s chair, called stronger salmon protections “long overdue.” When it comes to the state’s treatment of the Karuk, Yurok and other tribes, “there’s a history that has to be acknowledged,” he said.

Economic development has transformed California’s northernmost landscapes in great waves. Fur trappers decimated the beavers. Loggers sawed through old-growth forests. Miners dredged the Scott River in pursuit of gold, creating a 600-acre gravel moonscape that remains to this day.

All throughout, salmon have paid a price. In the 1930s, as many as 82,000 Chinook migrated up the Shasta each fall. Last year, only 4,500 made the trip.

“Our religion was salmon,” said Kenneth Brink, the vice chair of the Karuk tribal council. “When the salmon went away, the people went away, the ceremonies went away.”

Ranchers, for their part, see a parallel threat in water restrictions. One directed at their way of life, rather than the tribes’.

Leaving so much water in the rivers would mean “immediate lights out” for agriculture, said Theodora Johnson, who raises cattle in the Scott Valley. “My kids are seventh generation here,” she said. “I have to do everything I can to try to save it.”

Antiquated, unsearchable records

To understand one reason California struggles so mightily to track its water, you might visit a small room in Sacramento that is jam-packed with some of the state’s most valuable mysteries.

There are documents written in the ornate cursive of bygone times. Corduroy-bound ledgers. Maps whose labels have come unglued. Sepia photos of charmingly unphotogenic subjects: dirt fields, pear orchards, wooden sluices.

These are the water board’s records of every water right it has handed out since the early 20th century. Millions of musty files, smelling of history. And they are unwieldy, unsearchable — a mess.

Starting next month, all of this forgotten paper will, for the first time, be scanned and made accessible online to help resolve water disputes and better parcel out supplies during droughts. But soon, the board could go even further, demanding more information from farmers who hold the state’s oldest water claims, those dating back to the pioneer era.

Old maps in an “overflow room.” Erik Ekdahl, the documents’ keeper. California Water License No. 1.

In October, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law giving the board express authority to investigate whether these users have valid rights and, if so, are using them appropriately — a prospect that has rankled farmers up and down the state.

In the Central Valley, “you’ve got so many water-rights holders who believe their water rights are whatever their granddaddy said they were,” said Felicia Marcus, a visiting fellow at Stanford and former chair of the water board.

At the moment, the board’s records on California’s senior-most water users are sparse. Deeds, maps and notices might well exist that would tell regulators more about the origins of longstanding claims. But many of those documents have spent the past century or more hidden away in libraries and courthouses, or locked up at farms and irrigation districts.

The water board is hoping to bring more of them out of the shadows.

No other state has “this arbitrary thing that says that you can’t even ask basic questions about the validity of a right” just because it’s old, said State Senator Ben Allen, who proposed the bill that the governor recently signed.

The water board will “start small” with its new powers, said Erik Ekdahl, its deputy director in charge of water rights. It will first ask growers to update records and data here or there. As Mr. Ekdahl put it, the board might ask things like: “Hey, can you go in and update your place-of-use map? Because right now the one we have is literally a bunch of 3-by-5 pictures that you’ve taken and drawn on with a Sharpie, and we can’t actually make heads or tails of it.”

Eventually, though, the board might start digging deeper. And that has farmers on edge.

That’s because files that might help validate someone’s 19th-century water claim might already be lost to time, said John Herrick, a lawyer who represents growers in the Delta. “You have to find somebody’s journal that said, ‘I got up today on Aug. 21 in 1890 and opened the sluice gate,’” he said. “Jesus! That doesn’t exist.”

Baby carrots, big conflict

In a sun-scorched pocket of desert between the Sierra Madre Mountains and the Caliente Range, there is a length of Highway 166 flanked each summer by rows of lacy, bright-green stalks. These are the carrots of the Cuyama Valley, many destined to be clipped and shaved into those quintessential emblems of American supermarket ingenuity: baby carrots.

Of late, these carrots have become an emblem of something else, too: the state’s painful groundwater crisis.

About a decade ago — and, arguably, decades too late — California legislators finally did something about the fact that many of the state’s vital aquifers were being pumped dry beneath their feet. They passed a law, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, to end overuse and depletion.

Seen one way, the law is remarkably optimistic. Its premise is that neighbors will be neighborly: Instead of issuing top-down orders on how to conserve, the law leaves it up to local groups to work it out among themselves.

But in retrospect, this may have overestimated Californians’ neighborliness when water is at stake.

Carrots and water in the valley. New Cuyama’s sole grocery store. Anti-carrot sentiment.

In Cuyama, the corporate owners of the carrot fields are suing every other landowner in the valley: farms, vineyards, ranches, even the tiny school district. Their aim, effectively, is to make their neighbors share more of the burden of reducing water use under Cuyama’s sustainability plan. The case goes to trial next month.

“They know that their water table has gone down,” said Jim Wegis, who grows olives and pistachios nearby and is a defendant in the case. “It keeps going down. And they want us to help support their habit.”

Daniel T. Clifford, the general counsel for Bolthouse Properties, one of the plaintiffs, said the valley’s groundwater plan had left the companies no choice but to sue. The plan calls for total pumping to be cut by half to two-thirds over the next 15 years. So far, though, it is imposing those cuts only in the area of the valley that is dominated by Bolthouse and the other carrot giant, Grimmway.

“That’s not fair or consistent with California water law,” said Robert G. Kuhs, a lawyer representing the other plaintiffs, the owners of the land that Grimmway farms. “We strive to be good neighbors.”

In their section of the valley, the two carrot growers have used more water in recent decades than everyone else combined. Groundwater levels there are projected to fall by as much as seven feet a year, compared with two feet or less in other areas.

Others in Cuyama suspect that the carrot companies are trying to make as much money as they can in the valley before water restrictions make growing unviable and they move their operations someplace else.

Mr. Clifford, the Bolthouse Properties lawyer, said the carrot growers would always need to farm in Cuyama. The reason, he said, is all of us, the carrot-eating public.

“The American consumer has grown to absolutely rely” on being able to buy carrots 365 days a year, Mr. Clifford said. The high elevation of the Cuyama Valley makes it possible to produce them when it’s too hot to do so elsewhere. “They want that carrot year-round,” he said.

On this at least, he and Mr. Wegis, one of the neighboring growers his company is suing, can agree. Except that Mr. Wegis sees it as part of the problem.

“We as farmers have spoiled the public,” Mr. Wegis said. “Everybody’s used to going into the store and seeing everything they want, all the time.”

1641,2021-08-27,40 Million People Rely on the Colorado River. It’s Drying Up Fast.,"Western states arrived at this crucible in large part because of their own doing. The original multistate compact that governs the use of the Colorado, which was signed in 1922, was exuberantly optimistic: the states agreed to divide up an estimated total amount of water that turned out to be much more than what would actually flow. Nevertheless, with the building of the Hoover Dam to collect and store river water, and the development of the Colorado’s plumbing system of canals and pipelines to deliver it, the West was able to open a savings account to fund its extraordinary economic growth. Over the years since, those states have overdrawn the river’s average deposits. It should be no surprise that even without the pressures of climate change, such a plan would lead to bankruptcy.

Making a bad situation worse, leaders in Western states have allowed wasteful practices to continue that add to the material threat facing the region. A majority of the water used by farms — and thus much of the river — goes to growing nonessential crops like alfalfa and other grasses that feed cattle for meat production. Much of those grasses are also exported to feed animals in the Middle East and Asia. Short of regulating which types of crops are allowed, which state authorities may not even have the authority to do, it may fall to consumers to drive change. Water usage data suggests that if Americans avoid meat one day each week, they could save an amount of water equivalent to the entire flow of the Colorado each year, more than enough water to alleviate the region’s shortages.

Water is also being wasted because of flaws in the laws. The rights to take water from the river are generally distributed — like deeds to property — based on seniority. It is very difficult to take rights away from existing stakeholders, whether cities or individual ranchers, so long as they use the water allocated to them. That system creates a perverse incentive: Across the basin, ranchers often take their maximum allocation each year, even if just to spill it on the ground, for fear that, if they don’t, they could lose the right to take that water in the future. Changes in the laws that remove the threat of penalties for not exercising water rights, or that expand rewards for ranchers who conserve water, could be an easy remedy.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.3281,[],"['Much', 'Colorado', 'Asia']"

How do you feel about the dangerous weather occurring around the world? What do these events tell you about where we are in the fight against climate change — and how we should move forward?

In “Overlapping Disasters Expose Harsh Climate Reality: The U.S. Is Not Ready,” Christopher Flavelle, Anne Barnard, Brad Plumer and Michael Kimmelman write:

In Louisiana and Mississippi, nearly one million people lack electricity and drinking water after a hurricane obliterated power lines. In California, wildfire menaces Lake Tahoe, forcing tens of thousands to flee. In Tennessee, flash floods killed at least 20; hundreds more perished in a heat wave in the Northwest. And in New York City, 7 inches of rain fell in just hours Wednesday, drowning people in their basements. Disasters cascading across the country this summer have exposed a harsh reality: The United States is not ready for the extreme weather that is now becoming frequent as a result of a warming planet. “These events tell us we’re not prepared,” said Alice Hill, who oversaw planning for climate risks on the National Security Council during the Obama administration. “We have built our cities, our communities, to a climate that no longer exists.” In remarks Thursday, President Biden acknowledged the challenge ahead. “And to the country, the past few days of Hurricane Ida and the wildfires in the West and the unprecedented flash floods in New York and New Jersey is yet another reminder that these extreme storms and the climate crisis are here,” said Mr. Biden, who noted that a $1 trillion infrastructure bill pending in Congress includes some money to gird communities against disasters. “We need to do — be better prepared. We need to act.”

Damage from extreme weather, and threats to human life, will only increase as the planet warms. For every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit of global warming, the atmosphere holds about 7 percent more moisture, scientists have found. That means much heavier rainfall when storms do occur. Across the continental United States, the heaviest downpours have become more frequent and severe, according to the federal government’s National Climate Assessment.

1647,2021-07-26,Scores Die in India as Monsoon Rains Swamp Towns and Send Boulders Tumbling,"NEW DELHI — Within seconds, the scenic mountain valley resembled a war zone.

“Guys, we have to run!” said a man filming the devastation unfolding in his hillside town in northern India on Sunday, as a landslide set off by incessant monsoon rains sent heavy rocks tumbling down a steep slope.

At least nine people were killed when a boulder struck their vehicle. Their deaths added to a toll of at least 164, with 100 reported missing, on the country’s western coast, where heavy rains have deluged entire towns and villages.

India’s monsoons have always arrived with fury. But the scenes of death and destruction playing out in the country are yet another reminder of the urgency of climate change, experts say. A warming climate means extreme rainfall in many parts of the world, scientists have said.

We’ve colored the map to identify the top risks across the globe, using a model by Four Twenty Seven, a company that analyzes climate risks. Accumulated emissions in the atmosphere are causing accelerating risks for a number of climate hazards.

Tell us where you live and see how your country compares. No results found

In the United States, for instance, nearly 80 percent of the population, the economy and agriculture will be exposed to at least one high-risk climate hazard.

Worldwide, roughly 90 percent of the population will be exposed to one or more threats. This map is colored according to the risk affecting the highest share of the population in each area.

From 2000 to 2019, floods upended the lives of at least 1.65 billion people — the highest number in any disaster category. In 2040, 41 percent of the global population will be exposed to the risk of inundations. Southern and southeastern Asia would be among the places hardest hit, with more than two billion people at risk.

In the past 20 years, hurricanes, typhoons and other storms were the deadliest weather-related disasters, killing nearly 200,000 people worldwide. That is only expected to get worse. Island nations in the Caribbean and East Asia are the most vulnerable, with many lying along historical storm paths.

Heatwaves, which caused 91 percent of extreme temperature deaths in the past two decades, will be especially pronounced in Africa, where almost one billion people face a high risk of heat stress.

Northern parts of South America will be another densely populated area threatened by extreme heat. In Colombia and Venezuela, more than 90 percent of the population will be exposed. So will their crops.

Then there is climate inequality. Most people at greatest risk from climate change live in low- and mid-income regions. A 2019 study found that climate change has already deepened global economic inequality by around 25 percent.

In densely populated lower-income countries close to the equator, with weak economies, inadequate roads and power supplies and other infrastructure deficiencies, climate risks could lead to food shortages, mass migrations and other social challenges.

To make things worse, many of those countries will be exposed to multiple risks, which makes mitigation particularly challenging.

Consider the Philippines. In 2040, the country’s projected 134 million people, spread across a vast archipelago, will face a high risk of at least one climate hazard.

India faces a similar forecast, where floods, heat, lack of water and wildfires could diminish productivity, threaten crops and disrupt food supplies.

Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, has been suffering from climate change for years. Threats there include crop failures, contamination of water supplies and spread of diseases like malaria and cholera.

Rich Western countries are hardly immune. Increased temperatures in the Mediterranean could diminish productivity and crop yields, and disrupt entire industries like wine production in Spain.

California, a melting pot of climate hazards, faces almost every type of climate risk. Scientists predict that by the end of the century, rising sea levels could erode 31 percent to 67 percent of Southern California beaches, and the average area scorched by wildfires may increase by 77 percent.

Global challenges require a global response. On his first day in office, President Biden rejoined the Paris climate agreement, from which his predecessor had withdrawn; canceled the Keystone XL pipeline; and is moving to undo other anti-climate policies.

1649,2020-09-18,Every Place Has Its Own Climate Risk. What Is It Where You Live?,"For most of us, climate change can feel like an amorphous threat — with the greatest dangers lingering ominously in the future and the solutions frustratingly out of reach.

So perhaps focusing on today’s real harms could help us figure out how to start dealing with climate change. Here’s one way to do that: by looking at the most significant climate threat unfolding in your own backyard.

Risk level (low to very high) Wildfires Extreme heat Hurricanes Water stress Rainfall Sea level rise Risk level (low to very high) Wildfires Water stress Extreme heat Hurricanes Extreme rainfall Sea level rise Note: “Water stress” reflects the change in drought-like conditions as well as water demand. The methodology does not consider distant water supply, so in counties where that may play a larger role, we have selected the second-highest climate risk. Risk levels reflect climate impacts from today to 2040. The “wildfire” label applies to counties where at least part of the region contains the highest risk rating in Four Twenty Seven’s data. Other terms are assigned using the highest percentile scores among the remaining climate risks. · Source: Four Twenty Seven

Thinking this way transforms the West Coast’s raging wildfires into “climate fires.” The Gulf Coast wouldn’t live under the annual threat of floods but of “climate floods.” Those are caused by ever more severe “climate hurricanes.” The Midwest suffers its own “climate droughts,” which threaten water supplies and endanger crops.

This picture of climate threats uses data from Four Twenty Seven, a company that assesses climate risk for financial markets. The index measures future risks based on climate models and historical data. We selected the highest risk for each county to build our map and combined it with separate data from Four Twenty Seven on wildfire risks.

“Every single county has some sort of climate threat that’s either emerged and is doing some damage right now or is going to emerge,” said Nik Steinberg, the managing director of research at Four Twenty Seven and lead author of the climate risk report we consulted.

Despite the clear environmental threats, people still tend to believe climate change is something “far away in time and space,” according to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. And surveys show that while 61 percent of Americans say climate change poses a risk for people in the United States, only 43 percent think it will affect them personally.

The solution may be found in research showing that addressing climate change in emotional and personal terms is far more persuasive.

“There is a lot of evidence behind the idea that personalizing climate change and helping people understand the local impacts are more important than talking about how it’s influencing melting glaciers or talking about wildfires when you live in Ohio,” said Jennifer Marlon, a research scientist and lecturer at Yale.

The idea of a climate rebranding gained new attention this week after Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington told reporters: “These are not just wildfires. They are climate fires.”

Others have suggested similar language tweaks. Aaron Hall, writing in AdAge, questioned whether “climate change” felt too neutral or inevitable. He proposed “climate meltdown” or “climate chaos,” among other turns of phrase. Conservatives who believe the threat is false or exaggerated are waging their own branding war under the banner of “climate realism.”

But there is nothing false or exaggerated about watching your neighborhood burn down. Making Americans care about the long-term threat requires communicating the real harm happening today.

Start at the coasts, where climate hurricanes decimate the region with increasing intensity. The warming planet hasn’t produced more hurricanes than before, scientists say, but the hurricanes that do develop are far more severe.

Cameron Parish, a community of just 7,000 people in western Louisiana, was ravaged when Hurricane Laura ripped through the region last month. While the parish has the top climate hurricane risk level, only 29 percent of its residents thought climate change would affect them personally, according to Yale.

In many coastal areas, worsening storms will cause climate flooding, driven in part by rising sea levels. But climate floods are also a threat inland, from heavy rainfall, fast-melting snowpack or climate hurricanes. And they do significant damage, costing an average of $6.9 billion in damage per year.

That’s how climate change works: The problems overlap and cause even more problems.

Our data showed that the highest risk in much of California was water stress, which leads to droughts and wildfires. But those same regions can also face extreme rainfall, which feeds the vegetation that causes worsening wildfires.

“Just because a place has an extreme rainfall risk doesn’t mean that it also doesn’t have an extreme drought risk, and a sea level rise risk, and a wildfire risk,” said Jeffrey Mount, senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California’s Water Policy Center. “That, in a nutshell, is California.”

That brings us to the record-breaking climate fires sweeping the West Coast today. Though poor forest management and bad development decisions have contributed to worsening wildfires over the past several decades, climate droughts now lengthen fire season.

1650,2023-10-29,El Niños Are Predictable. We Should Prepare for Their Possibly Disastrous Consequences.,"As we head toward winter, the good news for those who shiver at the thought of cold weather is that temperatures are likely to be warmer for people who live in the nation’s northern tier.

You can thank the cyclical weather pattern known as El Niño for that.

But for other parts of the planet, the forecast is not nearly so agreeable. For some regions, it might be disastrous. Increased rainfall is likely in South America and severe drought in Australia, Indonesia and parts of southern Asia. Already there has been deadly flooding in Peru and India, and in Australia, where it is spring, officials are warning of an especially dangerous fire season this summer.

And just this past week, Hurricane Otis slammed ashore on the southern Pacific Coast of Mexico as a Category 5 hurricane after explosively intensifying. El Niño may have played a role in that transformation over a scant 24 hours; the warmer sea surface temperatures associated with the weather pattern provide favorable conditions for hurricane development in the eastern Pacific.

The human toll of these El Niño repercussions is immense. It is also increasingly understood.

America’s stewardship of one of its most precious resources, groundwater, relies on a patchwork of state and local rules so lax and outdated that in many places oversight is all but nonexistent, a New York Times analysis has found.

The majority of states don’t know how many wells they have, the analysis revealed. Many have incomplete records of older wells, including some that pump large volumes of water, and many states don’t register the millions of household wells that dot the country.

Even states that do try to count wells or regulate groundwater use often have other problems: Some carve out exemptions for powerful industries like agriculture, one of the nation’s biggest users of groundwater. And every state relies to some extent on well owners self-reporting their water use, the Times analysis found. That policy raises the risk of under-reporting or deception by users big and small.

Regulations in some states, including Oklahoma, are guided by a principle of letting users extract groundwater at rates that exceed an aquifer’s ability to recharge. Some hydrologists call it groundwater “mining.”

“I hate to say this, but essentially we don’t care if everything goes dry,” said Christopher Neel, a division chief at the Oklahoma Water Resources Board, although he added that this mindset is starting to change as groundwater becomes scarcer.

Oklahoma does limit pumping in certain areas and is studying how much water remains in its aquifers, information that lawmakers could use to set limits on pumping. Nevertheless, in parts of the state the expansive Ogallala Aquifer, which irrigates farms across the middle of the country, is dozens of feet lower than it was in the 1950s.

For generations, groundwater regulations around the country were routinely based on legal principles or economic forces that prioritized the needs of the moment, like farming and ranching in the West, or urban expansion in Eastern states. At the time, states often had little or no idea how much water aquifers held or how they might interact with lakes and rivers.

‘People are shopping around for where they can exploit groundwater.’

There is no shortage of rules. In fact, states have created such a tangle of regulations that it can be difficult to understand how much water is being extracted from aquifers, complicating the efforts to protect them. Yet groundwater is more important than ever as climate change intensifies heat, drought and erratic rainfall, making rivers and streams less reliable as water sources.

The Times asked officials in all 50 states detailed questions about how they track and regulate groundwater use — the drilling of wells, the pumping of water and the punishment of overusers. It is part of an investigative project revealing a nationwide groundwater crisis that is draining and damaging valuable aquifers.

The depletion threatens not only the tap water that supplies just over one-third of America’s drinking water, but also some of the most productive farmland in the world, which has become increasingly reliant on groundwater.

While farmers face severe risks from groundwater depletion, many warn that too much regulation would harm their livelihoods and the nation’s food supply.

“Farming would not exist as we know it in California without the use of groundwater,” said Chris Scheuring, a water attorney at the California Farm Bureau and a family farmer himself. Groundwater has helped much of the American West to become “marvelously productive,” he said, despite the region being a dry landscape where farmers can’t rely on rainfall and surface water alone. “And you know, farming is all of us.”

Nationwide, the jumble of regulations that The Times identified has fed an industry of lawyers and consultants who help big users follow the rules, and also, sometimes, to take advantage of them. “People are shopping around for where they can exploit groundwater,” said Reba Epler, a lawyer who works on water rights cases in Wyoming and New Mexico.

Some players in the industry are global giants, like the consulting firm Arup, which helps data centers sift through layers of rules to make sure they have enough water for cooling their computer systems. Others operate regionally, for example Water365 in Wisconsin, which works with municipalities in the Great Lakes region. California’s State Water Resources Control Board provides a list of some 85 firms that help clients who have questions about water rights there.

Historically, Congress has left the policing of wells and aquifers to individual states for myriad reasons, including that groundwater has been so poorly understood. As late as the early 1900s, court rulings cited the “secret, occult and concealed” movement of groundwater to argue that administering rules on its use would be an exercise in “hopeless uncertainty.”

Today, in places with some of the weakest oversight, irrigation is on the rise. In the parts of the lower Mississippi River region, where states including Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana have wide tracts of land with few or no restrictions on pumping groundwater, irrigation for water-intensive crops such as cotton, corn and soybeans soared in recent years as farmers sought higher yields amid worsening drought linked to climate change.

The vast majority of irrigation in this region comes from groundwater.

An official Missouri website, in fact, boasts that the state “has some of the loosest water laws in the country.” The state allows well owners, under most circumstances, to pump as much as they like without oversight.

“We’re just blessed” with water resources, said Andrew Sheeley, a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.

Missouri has two major rivers, and it sits atop the immense Ozark Aquifer, which is more than 1,000 feet deep in places. But more than 85 percent of the state is experiencing drought, and wells that monitor conditions in the Ozark Aquifer show declines and historic lows in a handful of places.

Last month, at a state committee meeting to address the drought, speakers invoked the Dust Bowl of the 1930s and the back-to-back droughts leading up to it, and raised concerns about increased fire threats. “This is probably one of the most important things that we’re going to be dealing with for the people in Missouri for a while,” Gov. Mike Parson told the committee.

Among the states that do set limits on pumping, some make exceptions for prominent industries, emergency use or everyday activities like lawn care. States including Kentucky and Vermont generally exempt agricultural irrigation, one of the top users of groundwater nationwide. In Oregon, firefighting gets a pass, and most of the time so do small lawns and personal gardens.

In Texas, people who own land also own the water under it, which means farmers over the depleting Ogallala Aquifer can claim a tax deduction for irrigation. In effect, the practice rewards high water use in water-stressed areas. (The tax code considers it a “cost depletion” because the water “would be lost to the taxpayer and immediately succeeding generations.”)

Dave Owen, a professor at UC Law San Francisco, said that, “If you know water is a shared resource, and nobody is restraining anybody else from pumping, you have a powerful incentive to get yours while you can.” He described groundwater regulation in the United States as “Swiss cheese.”

In September, following publication of the Times’s earlier findings on aquifer depletion nationwide, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat who leads the Energy and Natural Resource Committee’s Water and Power Subcommittee, held a hearing on what he called the country’s drinking water crisis. “It’s hard to figure out who’s actually in charge of water policy,” he said during the hearing. “We’ve got to get practical data on the scope of the problem.”

States vary widely in the data that they collect and share.

When officials in Maine were asked if the state keeps a list of water wells, Ryan Gordon, a hydrogeologist at the Maine Geological Survey, responded, “The total is unknown, and we don’t even have a good estimate.”

Through the United States Geological Survey, the federal government does collect well-monitoring data around the country. But overall, the lack of coordination among states on data and regulations has contributed to conflicts breaking out across state lines where laws or activities clash at the border.

Mississippi sued its neighbor Tennessee claiming that the more than 160 drinking-water wells supplying Memphis were pumping so much that they were siphoning the flow of groundwater away from Mississippi, in some places causing the earth to sink. The yearslong fight went all the way to the United States Supreme Court, where Mississippi lost.

The court said states sharing a water resource need to respect each other’s interests. “When Tennessee pumps groundwater, it is pumping water located within its own territory,” the 2021 ruling said. “That some of the water was previously located in Mississippi is of no moment.”

“People connect with water at a visceral level in such a way that, if you mess with their water, the guns will come out,” said Gabriel Eckstein, a law professor at Texas A&M University who is studying differences in groundwater regulation from state to state.

One practical problem The Times’s research identified is that state water authorities are often small operations relative to their sprawling responsibilities and the growing danger of aquifer damage.

Last year state regulators in Minnesota, who have complained of being short-staffed, found out about unauthorized wells only after dozens of people reported their faucets had run dry. The reason: The city of Blaine was operating wells without permits and pumping so much that they interfered with household taps a few miles away.

The city had to reimburse residents for costs tied to the episode.

‘If you mess with their water, the guns will come out.’

In Wyoming, which has issued tens of thousands of well permits, fewer than two dozen state employees are assigned to handle permitting issues for the ranchers, oil producers, mining companies and irrigators who use them. In the southeastern part of the state, the Ogallala Aquifer is diminishing.

Staff reinforcements can be called in from the State Engineer’s Office and from other agencies if needed, said Jeremy Manley, assistant administrator of the groundwater division in the engineer’s office. And regulators have the power to fine anyone who abuses groundwater rules. However, he said, officials tend to use a softer approach by first seeking compliance.

That method has led to abuses in places such as Laramie County, where several feedlots have operated unauthorized wells that pump significant volumes of water. “If you want to do it illegally, the state doesn’t have enough people to do anything about it,” said Cody Smith, who owns a well installation service and is a member of a water-use advisory committee for the state engineer’s office.

Most states do have financial penalties in place, the Times analysis found. A well operating outside its permitted use in Colorado could be subject to fines of $500 per day. In Maryland, groundwater abusers can be fined $5,000 a day. But many fines are essentially meaningless for big farms or factories.

Some also divide oversight among several agencies, making it difficult to glean comprehensive information about groundwater use. In Illinois, for example, three separate state agencies oversee different kinds of wells and groundwater uses.

“There are layers and layers of rules and regulations,” said Sharon Megdal, director of the Water Resources Research Center at the University of Arizona. She said only 13 states had statutes setting up formal communication among agencies. Illinois is among them.

There are models for regional cooperation. The Great Lakes Compact, created in 2008, is an agreement between eight states that regulates groundwater and surface water withdrawals across the Great Lakes basin.

It’s an example of governance guided by the water itself, rather than by artificial boundaries on a map, said Elizabeth Cisar, who is director of the environment program at the Joyce Foundation, which provides grants on drinking water in the Great Lakes region. “Hydrology should drive the rules and regulations,” she said, “not state borders.”

A few states have also toughened their oversight.

‘You have a powerful incentive to get yours while you can.’

Last year Arizona expanded bans on new irrigation to more of the state, and this year put new limits on the construction of homes that rely on groundwater in the Phoenix area. In Kansas, where in some areas aquifer levels have dipped 40 feet in a decade, the governor has signed into law measures designed to ensure local regulators take action in parts of the state where groundwater use is highest.

In Minnesota, state lawmakers this year increased fines for violators who pump more water than their permits allow. Still, farmers in Minnesota, who count among some of the biggest water users, are allowed to self-report their use.

A handful of states, including Washington, have tested a system of taking remote readings from wells rather than having users report their own withdrawals. But the program applied to only some wells. For many of the others, as in most states, users take their own readings and report them.

“To some extent, we are relying on the water user to not be committing fraud,” Dr. Gordon, the hydrogeologist in Maine, said.

The causes of floods are complex, including land development and ground conditions. But many experts in Italy, including Barbara Lastoria, a hydraulic engineer, have linked the two devastating storms that occurred over two weeks to climate change.

The amount of water that fell — about 19.6 inches of rain in 15 days, more than half the average annual rainfall in the region — was extraordinary, experts say, exacerbated by a monthslong drought that had left the terrain struggling to absorb all of that rain.

In New York City, a tropical storm delivered record-breaking rains this weekend. Heavy downpours caused devastating flash floods in central Tennessee, tearing apart houses and killing more than 20 people. Yet, California and much of the West remained in the deepest drought in at least two decades, the product of a long-term precipitation shortfall and temperatures that are much hotter than usual.

This divide, a wetter East and a drier West, reflects a broader pattern observed in the United States in recent decades.

The map above, created using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shows the Eastern half of the country has gotten more rain, on average, over the last 30 years than it did during the 20th century, while precipitation has decreased in the West. (Thirty-year averages are often used by scientists to glean big-picture climate trends from temperature and precipitation data that varies substantially year-to-year.)

It’s not yet clear whether these changes in precipitation are a permanent feature of our warming climate, or whether they reflect long-term weather variability. But they are largely consistent with predictions from climate models, which expect to see more precipitation overall as the world warms, with big regional differences. Broadly: Wet places get wetter and dry places get drier.

“There’s variability from year to year,” and even decade to decade, said Andreas Prein, a project scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. “But climate change is slowly pushing this variability” toward wetter and drier extremes, he said.

Increase in Extremes

How much it rains or snows, averaged over time, is one way of analyzing changing precipitation patterns. Another way is to look at changes in the heaviest rainfalls and snowstorms. That’s where the biggest impacts can be felt.

Extreme precipitation changes Percent change between 1901 and 2016 +5% +10 +15 +20 NORTHWEST Northern GREAT PLAINS NORTH- EAST MIDWEST WEST AND SOUTHWEST SOUTHEAST SOUTHERN GREAT PLAINS Extreme precipitation changes Percent change between 1901 and 2016 +5% +10 +15 +20 Source: Climate Science Special Report: Fourth National Climate Assessment · Map shows changes in 5-year maximum daily precipitation between 1901 and 2016.

The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation across the country have increased more than average precipitation, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment, with the largest increases seen in the Midwest and Northeast. (Because heavy precipitation is more variable than average precipitation, trends have to be measured over broader geographical regions.)

Stronger downpours are a hallmark of climate change. As the climate warms, increased evaporation pumps more moisture into the air. And warmer air can hold more moisture — about 7 percent more with every degree Celsius of warming, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (which is about how much the world has warmed since preindustrial times). That means when it rains, it tends to rain more.

“We’re seeing warmer temperatures and warmer oceans,” said David R. Easterling, director of the National Climate Assessment Technical Support Unit. “So, you have more moisture in the atmosphere that’s able to rain out in these storms.”

As the planet continues to warm, he said, “we just expect that it's going to get worse.”

A Global Pattern

Similar patterns can be seen worldwide: On average, global land areas have seen more precipitation since 1950. But even as much of the world has become wetter, some regions have become drier.

Most of Asia has gotten wetter, driven by a rise in heavy precipitation. Average precipitation has increased in Northern and Central Europe, while the Mediterranean has gotten drier, on average, and is experiencing water scarcity. Much of Africa has gotten drier. So has eastern Australia.

Extreme precipitation is also on the rise around the world.

A recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that heavy precipitation has increased since the 1950s across most land areas with detailed weather records, a trend the report said is likely driven by human-caused global warming.

This summer has seen heavy downpours wreak havoc around the world, from Germany to India and China, with floods causing many hundreds of deaths. This week, a team of scientists reported that Germany’s extreme flooding was made more likely by climate change.

1658,2020-02-05,How Europe Turned Into a Perfect Landscape for Wildfires,"TIVISSA, Spain — Forests are getting some high-profile attention lately.

President Trump expressed his support on Tuesday night for a global effort to plant one trillion trees, which itself was announced at a gathering of business and political leaders in Davos, Switzerland, in January. A trillion trees, it was said at that meeting of the World Economic Forum, would go a long way in addressing climate change.

But while trees — and particularly forests full of trees — are vital for swallowing up and storing carbon, currently absorbing 30 percent of planet-warming carbon dioxide, they are also extremely vulnerable in the age of climate disruptions.

In a hotter, drier, more flammable climate, like here in the Mediterranean region, forests can die slowly from drought or they can go up in flames almost instantly, releasing all the carbon stored in their trunks and branches into the atmosphere.

That raises an increasingly urgent question: How best to manage woodlands in a world that humans have so profoundly altered? “We need to decide what will be the climate-change forest for the future,” is how Kirsten Thonicke, a fire ecologist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, framed the challenge.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,news analysis,0,0,0,0.3412,"['Spain', 'Switzerland']",[]

About 16 million acres have burned in New South Wales and Victoria, where the crisis is centered. That’s an area about the size of West Virginia. Millions more acres have burned in other parts of the country.

What sets these blazes apart, in terms of their size, is that they are happening in populated areas. Until now, fires this large happened mostly in places like northern Canada or Siberia, where few people live and blazes burn largely uncontrolled.

“What we’re seeing in Australia, in a completely different environment, are fires that are approaching or even exceeding the magnitude of things that we only saw in the most remote forested regions in the world,” said Ross Bradstock, the director of the Center for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong in New South Wales.

“We’re looking at a globally significant fire season in Australia,” he added.

The numbers from Australia dwarf those from some of the most high-profile fires in recent years.

The bushfires in southeastern Australia this season have burned about eight times as much land as the 2018 fires in California, which covered nearly two million acres and were the worst in that state’s recorded history.

1660,2022-08-28,Your Monday Briefing: Record Heat Disrupts China,"Record heat and drought in China

A record-setting drought and an 11-week heat wave are causing broad disruption in southwestern China, a region that depends on dams for more than three-quarters of its electricity generation.

Factories owned by Foxconn, Toyota and Volkswagen have curtailed production or closed for lack of power. Owners of electric cars are waiting overnight at charging stations. In Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, several neighborhoods went without electricity for more than 10 hours a day.

The Yangtze River has receded so much that many oceangoing ships can no longer reach upstream ports, forcing China to divert large numbers of trucks to carry their cargo. A single ship can require 500 or more trucks to move its cargo.

China’s extreme weather has potential implications for the world’s efforts to halt climate change.

Another report warned that tens of millions of people are likely to be displaced by 2050 because of climate change — including as many as 143 million people in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.

The national security warnings came on the same day that top financial regulators for the first time flagged climate change as “an emerging threat” to the American economy. More frequent and destructive disasters, such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires, are resulting in property damage, lost income and business disruptions that threaten to change the way real estate and other assets are valued, according to a report released by a panel of federal and state regulators. As of Oct. 8, there have been 18 “weather/climate disaster events” in 2021 costing more than $1 billion each, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The reports came as President Biden prepares to attend a major United Nations climate conference in Glasgow known as COP26. With his climate agenda stalled in Congress, Mr. Biden risks having little progress to tout in Glasgow, where the administration had hoped to re-establish United States leadership on addressing warming.

The reports “reinforce the President’s commitment to evidence-based decisions guided by the best available science and data,” the White House said Thursday, and “will serve as a foundation for our critical work on climate and security moving forward.”

The notion that climate change is a national security threat isn’t new — the Obama administration said as much, and began pushing the Pentagon to consider climate risks.

1662,2023-01-03,Is a Dam in Rural Portugal a Key to Our Alternative Energy Future?,"Jan. 3, 2023

When Portugal’s electrical system needs a boost, a signal activates a power plant buried deep in a hillside in the country’s scrubby, pine-covered north. Inside the man-made cavern, valves, nine feet in diameter, suddenly open, allowing water draining from a reservoir four miles away to begin streaming through four massive turbines.

Up close, the spinning turbines make an earsplitting din. At full power, they generate enough electricity to rival a nuclear reactor.

This is the heart of a vast hydroelectric project that is reshaping a rugged river valley about 65 miles east of Porto, Portugal’s second-largest city after Lisbon. Besides the underground power plant, Iberdrola, the Spanish energy giant, has built three dams in the area — two on the Tâmega River and one on a feeder stream — and the three resulting reservoirs sprawl over nearly four square miles.

“This is my pyramids,” said David Rivera Pantoja, the project manager, who has been working on the project for almost 15 years.

But the 1.5 billion euro ($1.6 billion) complex of concrete, tunnels and water is not just massive. It is also providing an answer to one of the most vexing questions facing renewable energy.

Hundreds of billions of dollars are being spent across the globe on solar energy and wind power. But when the sun goes down, or the breezes become still, where will the electricity come from?

1663,2022-09-07,A Summer of Climate Disasters,"Climate disasters also hit many other parts of the world this year:

In the U.S., a heat wave on the West Coast has sent temperatures soaring above 110 degrees Fahrenheit in the past few days. About 100 million Americans across the country suffered another heat wave earlier this summer. And floods have ravaged parts of the U.S., including Kentucky and Missouri.

The earlier heat wave that hit Pakistan reached India, too. A severe drought also struck parts of India this summer, reducing the country’s food exports. And floods in Bengaluru, India’s tech capital, forced workers to ride boats and tractors to get to the office.

A heat wave and drought in China dried up rivers, disabling hydroelectric dams and cutting off ships carrying supplies.

Another heat wave in Europe sent temperatures in Britain to a record 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Droughts across the continent dried up rivers, exposing sunken ships from World War II and disrupting the river cruise industry. And wildfires in Europe have burned nearly three times as much land so far this year as the 2006-2021 average.

In April, heavy rainfall caused floods and mudslides in South Africa that killed at least 45 people.

“Some of these events have no historical comparisons from 200 years ago,” my colleague Raymond Zhong, who covers climate change, told me.

Why? Rising temperatures create the circumstances for more frequent and more intense heat waves. Prolonged heat causes more frequent and more intense droughts and wildfires. And as it gets warmer, more water evaporates from the oceans — leading to more moisture in the air, and then heavier rainfall, floods and mudslides.

More to come

In my conversations with experts, I referred to the summer’s extreme weather as a “new normal.” But the experts pushed back on that characterization. They argued that calling it normal suggested we had reached some sort of plateau.

“It’s very much getting worse,” said Kim Cobb, the director of the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. Humanity has emitted greenhouse gases through industrialization for more than a century. Those gases are already in the atmosphere, causing warming and extreme weather. Past and future emissions will continue to heat up the planet over the next couple of decades, leading to even more disasters.

That doesn’t mean the world is helpless, experts said. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as Democrats’ new spending law aims to do, can still lower the risk of climate disasters over the medium term. In the short term, humans can mitigate disasters through adaptation — using better forest management to reduce wildfire risk, for example, or building infrastructure that is more resilient to heavy rainfall and flooding.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,1,0,0,-0.9891,"['Pakistan', 'United States', 'India', 'China', 'South Africa']",['Missouri']

In cities from Syria to Central America, families go to bed hungry. In Afghanistan, starving children stream into hospitals.

On Monday, a ship carrying grain that left the Ukrainian port of Odesa, the first since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, also carried fragile hopes that it might stem a global tide of hunger.

Another 16 grain ships are expected to leave in the coming days, navigating mined waters in the Black Sea.

But experts say that getting Ukrainian grain exports moving again will barely make a dent in a global food crisis that the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, has warned could last for years.

Because Democrats could lose control of Congress after 2022 and Republicans have shown little interest in climate legislation, it could be years before another opportunity arises — a delay that scientists say the planet cannot afford.

The climate provisions are designed to quickly transform energy and transportation, the country’s two largest sources of greenhouse gases, from systems that now mostly burn gas, oil and coal to sectors that run increasingly on clean energy from the sun, wind and nuclear power.

The impact will touch a broad cross-section of American life, from the kinds of cars that Americans drive, to the types of crops grown by farmers, to the way homes are heated and buildings are constructed. One measure could shutter virtually all of the nation’s remaining coal plants, forcing sweeping change in communities dependent on mining but also, one study estimated, preventing as many as 50,000 premature deaths from pollution by 2030. And other measures would provide billions to replant in national forests, repair trails for hikers and clear brush to reduce the risk of wildfire.

“Each time you let these opportunities slip through your fingers, you’re passing a much harder problem on to the next generation,” said Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology and mother of four. “It’s a very hard thing to swallow that we are relegating children born today and not yet born to a future of dangerous climate impacts.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,2,0,0,-0.0231,"['United States', 'Georgia']",[]

There are new threats in the ocean, too, that are less understood but may be tied to global warming, according to researchers.

Scientists and fishers had been braced for bad numbers. Conditions were terrible a couple of years earlier, when the salmon were young and tiny in low, overheated creeks and rivers in California. But as the fish counts came in and the models spit out figures, the numbers were even more dismal than expected.

Nothing like it had ever happened before — these wildfires began far earlier and spread far faster than usual, and they have burned far more boreal forest than any fire in Canada’s modern history.

As of this writing, 5,881 wildfires have consumed 15.3 million hectares, about 59,000 square miles, dwarfing the 10-year average of 2.6 million hectares per summer. That’s like all New York State incinerated, and the fires are burning still. One environmentalist told me that “unprecedented” has been used so often that it has lost any meaning against the uniqueness and horror of what is happening.

With the melting Arctic to their north and the immensity of their northern wilderness, Canadians are not strangers to climate anxiety. But as The Globe and Mail reported, “Canada’s summer of fire and smoke” has still come as a profound shock to the nation, “materially and psychologically, as people across the country report a sense of dread about the disaster unfolding just out of sight, and what it portends for the future.”

And as the summer unfolded, it became evident that it’s not just smoke, and not just Canada. This has been the summer from climate hell all across Earth, when it ceased being possible to escape or deny what we have done to our planet and ourselves. “Even I am surprised by this year,” said Michael Flannigan, a professor at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, British Columbia, who has been studying the interaction of fire and climate for over 35 years. “Temperatures are rising at the rate we thought they would, but the effects are more severe, more frequent, more critical.

The unprecedented fires in the wetland have attracted less attention than blazes in Australia, the Western United States and the Amazon, its celebrity sibling to the north. But while the Pantanal is not a global household name, tourists in the know flock there because it is home to exceptionally high concentrations of breathtaking wildlife: Jaguars, tapirs, endangered giant otters and bright blue hyacinth macaws. Like a vast tub, the wetland swells with water during the rainy season and empties out during the dry months. Fittingly, this rhythm has a name that evokes a beating heart: the flood pulse.

The wetland, which is larger than Greece and stretches over parts of Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia, also offers unseen gifts to a vast swath of South America by regulating the water cycle upon which life depends. Its countless swamps, lagoons and tributaries purify water and help prevent floods and droughts. They also store untold amounts of carbon, helping to stabilize the climate.

For centuries, ranchers have used fire to clear fields and new land. But this year, drought worsened by climate change turned the wetlands into a tinderbox and the fires raged out of control.

“The extent of fires is staggering,” said Douglas C. Morton, who leads the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and studies fire and food production in South America. “When you wipe out a quarter of a biome, you create all kinds of unprecedented circumstances.”

His analysis showed that at least 22 percent of the Pantanal in Brazil has burned since January, with the worst fires, in August and September, blazing for two months straight.

Naturally occurring fire plays a role in the Pantanal, in addition to the burning by ranchers. The flames are usually contained by the landscape’s mosaic of water. But this year’s drought sucked these natural barriers dry. The fires are far worse than any since satellite records began.

Even the jaguar that once scared me is suffering. That hurts me. I suffer from depression because of this. Now there is a hollow silence. I feel as though our freedom has left us, has been taken from us with the nature that we have always protected.”

Now these people of the wetlands, some still coughing after weeks of smoke, are depending on donations of water and food. They fear that once the rains come in October, ash will run into the rivers and kill the fish they rely on for their food and livelihood.

“I couldn’t help but think, our Pantanal is dead,” said Eunice Morais de Amorim, another member of the community. “It is so terrible.”

Scientists are scrambling to determine an estimate of animals killed in the fires. While large mammals and birds have suffered casualties, many were able to run or fly away. It appears that reptiles, amphibians and small mammals have fared the worst. In places like California, small animals often take refuge underground during wildfires. But in the Pantanal, scientists say, fires burn underground too, fueled by dried-out wetland vegetation. One of the hard-hit places was a national park designated as a United Nations World Heritage site.

“I don’t want to be an alarmist,” said José Sabino, a biologist at the Anhanguera-Uniderp University in Brazil who studies the Pantanal, “but in a region where 25 percent has burned, there is a huge loss.”

As the worst flames raged in August and September, biologists, ecotourism guides and other volunteers turned into firefighters, sometimes working 24 hours at a time. Fernando Tortato, a conservation scientist with Panthera, a group that advocates for big cats, visited the Pantanal in early August to install cameras for his research monitoring jaguars and ocelots. But he found the camera sites burned.

“I said to my boss, I need to change my job,” Mr. Tortato said. “I need to be a firefighter.” Instead of returning home to his family, he spent much of the next two months digging fire breaks with a bulldozer in an urgent attempt to protect forested areas.

One day in September, working under an orange sky, he and his team finished a huge semicircular fire break, using a wide river along one side to protect more than 3,000 hectares, he said, a vital refuge for wildlife. But as the men stood there, pleased with their accomplishment, they watched as flaming debris suddenly jumped the river, igniting the area they thought was safe. They raced into boats and tried to douse the spread, but the flames quickly climbed too high.

“That’s the moment that we lost hope, almost,” Mr. Tortato said. “But the next day we woke up and started again.”

Mr. Tortato knows of three injured jaguars, one with third-degree burns on her paws. All were treated by veterinarians. Now, biologists are braced for the next wave of deaths from starvation; first the herbivores, left without vegetation, and then the carnivores, left without the herbivores.

“It’s a cascade effect,” Mr. Tortato said.

Animal rescue volunteers have flocked to the Pantanal, delivering injured animals to pop-up veterinary triage stations and leaving food and water for other animals to find. Larissa Pratta Campos, a veterinary student, has helped treat wild boar, marsh deer, birds, primates and a raccoon-like creature called a coati.

“We are working in the middle of a crisis,” Ms. Pratta Campos said. “I have woken up many times in the middle of the night to tend to animals here.”

Last week, the O Globo newspaper reported that firefighting specialists from Brazil's main environmental protection agency were stymied by bureaucratic procedures, delaying their deployment by four months.

Given the historic scope of the fires, their long-term consequences on the Pantanal are unclear. The ecosystem’s grasslands may recover quickly, followed by its shrublands and swamps over the next few years, said Wolfgang J. Junk, a scientist who specializes in the region. But the forests will require decades or centuries.

Even more critical than the impact of this year’s fires, scientists say, is what they tell us about the underlying health of the wetlands. Like a patient whose high fever signals a dangerous infection, the extent of the wildfires is a symptom of grave threats to the Pantanal, both from inside and out.

More than 90 percent of the Pantanal is privately owned. Ranchers have raised cattle there for hundreds of years, and ecologists emphasize that many do so sustainably. But new farmers are moving in, often with little understanding of how to use fire properly, said Cátia Nunes, a scientist from the Brazilian National Institute for Science and Technology in Wetlands. Moreover, cattle farming in the highlands has put pressure on local farmers to increase the size of their herds, using more land as they do so.

Eduardo Eubank Campos, a fifth-generation rancher, remembers his family using controlled burns to clear the land when he was a boy. He said they stopped after adding an ecotourism lodge to their 7,000 hectare property, which now includes reserves and fields on which they raise about 2,000 head of cattle and horses. This year, thanks to firebreaks, a water tank truck and workers quickly trained to fight fire, they were able to keep the flames at bay. The worst impact was on his ecotourism business, hit first by the coronavirus and then by the wildfires. It brings in three-quarters of his revenue.

Mr. Eubank Campos struggles to understand who would set fires when the land was so dry. “Pantaneiros know this is not the time to do burns,” Mr. Eubank Campos said, using a term for the locals that also conveys a culture built up over centuries ranching in the wetland. “They don’t want to destroy their own land.”

The Brazilian federal police are investigating the fires, some of which appear to have been illegally targeting forests.

Still, when asked about the biggest threat to the Pantanal, Mr. Eubank Campos’s answer highlights the region’s political and cultural fault lines. “I fear those organizations that come here wanting to exploit the issue and eventually ‘close’ the Pantanal, turn it into one big reserve and kick out the Pantaneiros,” he said.

Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who campaigned on a promise to weaken conservation regulations, is popular in the region.

But Mr. Eubank Campos agrees with ecologists on a major threat to the Pantanal that comes from its borders and beyond.

Because ecosystems are interconnected, the well-being of the wetland is at the mercy of the booming agriculture in the surrounding highlands. The huge fields of soy, other grains and cattle — commodities traded around the world — cause soil erosion that flows into the Pantanal, clogging its rivers so severely that some have become accidental dams, robbing the area downstream of water.

The rampant deforestation and related fires in the neighboring Amazon also create a domino effect, disrupting the rainforest’s “flying rivers” of precipitation that contribute to rainfall to the Pantanal. Damming for hydroelectric power deflects water away, scientists say, and a proposal to channelize the wetland’s main river would make it drain too quickly.

But perhaps the most ominous danger comes from even further afield: climate change. The effects that models have predicted, a much hotter Pantanal alternating between severe drought and extreme rainfall, are already being felt, scientists say. A study published this year found that climate change poses “a critical threat” to the ecosystem, damaging biodiversity and impairing its ability to help regulate water for the continent and carbon for the world. In less than 20 years, it found that the northern Pantanal may turn into a savanna or even an arid zone.

“We are digging our grave,” said Karl-Ludwig Schuchmann, an ecologist with Brazil’s National Institute of Science and Technology in Wetlands and one of the study’s authors.

To save the Pantanal, scientists offer solutions: Reduce climate change immediately. Practice sustainable agriculture in and around the wetland. Pay ranchers to preserve forests and other natural areas on their land. Increase ecotourism. Do not divert the Pantanal’s waters, because its flood pulse is its life.

“Everybody talks about, ‘we have to avoid this and that,’” Dr. Schuchmann said. “But little is done.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,5,0,0,-0.9955,"['Greece', 'Paraguay', 'Brazil', 'Bolivia, Plurinational State of', 'Australia', 'United States']","['Morton', 'Campos', 'Douglas', 'Poconé']"

The lake’s flies and brine shrimp would die off — scientists warn it could start as soon as this summer — threatening the 10 million migratory birds that stop at the lake annually to feed on the tiny creatures. Ski conditions at the resorts above Salt Lake City, a vital source of revenue, would deteriorate. The lucrative extraction of magnesium and other minerals from the lake could stop.

Most alarming, the air surrounding Salt Lake City would occasionally turn poisonous. The lake bed contains high levels of arsenic and as more of it becomes exposed, wind storms carry that arsenic into the lungs of nearby residents, who make up three-quarters of Utah’s population.

“We have this potential environmental nuclear bomb that’s going to go off if we don’t take some pretty dramatic action,” said Joel Ferry, a Republican state lawmaker and rancher who lives on the north side of the lake.

As climate change continues to cause record-breaking drought, there are no easy solutions. Saving the Great Salt Lake would require letting more snowmelt from the mountains flow to the lake, which means less water for residents and farmers.

The Bootleg Fire in Southern Oregon, spurred by months of drought and last month’s blistering heat wave, is the largest wildfire so far this year in the United States, having already burned more than 340,000 acres, or 530 square miles, of forest and grasslands.

And at a time when climate change is causing wildfires to be larger and more intense, it’s also one of the most extreme, so big and hot that it’s affecting winds and otherwise disrupting the atmosphere.

Maui’s arguments are also likely to resonate with a local jury.

“Here in Hawaii, folks are in disaster recovery mode, and the longer arc of something like a lawsuit necessarily has to take a back seat,” said Richard Wallsgrove, law professor and adviser to the Environmental Law Program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. “But it’s also clear that what’s at stake in these cases, and all the climate litigation cases that are brewing in Hawaii and elsewhere, is seen right there in the Maui wildfires.”

Scientists are increasingly able to attribute specific disasters, like extreme weather or wildfires, to global warming, and even tie events to fossil fuel producers. And while that attribution can take time, scientists have pointed to Hawaii’s declining average rainfall as well as drought, hurricane winds and other conditions linked to climate change as factors that fueled the Maui fire.

At the same time, academic and congressional researchers, environmental groups, journalists, and lawyers have chronicled how oil and gas companies, despite knowing for decades that burning fossil fuels would dangerously heat the planet, have worked to downplay or deny that knowledge.

Forecasters reported temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius, or 104 degrees Fahrenheit, today in London. Officials issued Britain’s first “red” warning for extreme heat, declaring a national emergency in a country accustomed to temperate weather, where few homes have air conditioning. In the U.S., President Biden reportedly may declare a climate emergency as soon as this week, according to The Washington Post.

The human toll of the heat wave has been alarming. Hundreds of people have died across Europe. Thousands more have had to flee wildfires in Spain, France and Greece.

Extreme heat is also hurting the economy, according to a study last year by European economists and climate experts. The researchers estimated that heat waves on average had lowered overall annual G.D.P. growth across Europe by as much as 0.5 percent in the past decade, potentially more than twice the damage they estimated from heat waves in previous decades. The reason: Extreme heat tends to lower productivity, currently for those who work outside, but increasingly for people who work inside, too.

At 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming, those heat waves will strike every 5 years and be significantly hotter. At 4 degrees of warming, they will occur nearly annually.

Or take sea level rise. At 1.5 degrees of warming, ocean levels are projected to rise another 1 to 2 feet this century, regularly inundating many coastal cities with floods that in the past would have occurred just once a century. But if temperatures keep increasing, the report said, there is a risk that the vast ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland could destabilize in unpredictable ways, potentially adding another three feet of sea-level rise this century in the worst case.

Further unpredictable changes may be in store. For example, a crucial ocean circulation system in the Atlantic Ocean, which helps stabilize the climate in Europe, is now starting to slow down. While the panel concluded with “medium confidence” that the system was unlikely to collapse abruptly this century, it warned that if the planet keeps heating up, the odds of such “low likelihood, high impact outcomes” would rise.

It is true that in a warming world, less snow is falling in total, and covering less area, said Kevin Reed, an associate professor at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook University on Long Island. But higher temperatures also allow the atmosphere to hold more water, which creates more precipitation and makes it more likely to fall quickly.

“That means there are still times and cases where that precipitation increase comes in the form of snow,” Dr. Reed said. “We know that to be true.”



Overall, Dr. Reed said, a few degrees of global warming means that some storms that would have brought snow on a 31-degree day will end up dumping rain at 33 degrees. But on the other hand, more snow falls when temperatures are just below freezing than during extreme cold.

“So a storm that’s a little warmer but still below freezing, a storm that might’ve been a 25-degree storm but ends up as a 30-degree storm, means it will snow more,” he said.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,0.904,[],['Long Island']

Air pollution was responsible for 6.67 million deaths worldwide in 2019, mostly in North Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and East Asia.

Air pollution mainly comes from burning things: coal in power plants, gasoline in cars, chemicals in factories, or wood and whatever else ignites in wildfires. The particles are too small for the eye to see, but in high concentrations they cast a haze in the sky.

In China, cities have been choked by dusty, toxic air since the 1980s.

1689,2021-12-31,Scenes From a World on Fire,"Planet Earth is the one thing that all humans share. We are often at its mercy. We take its majesty for granted. We forget that we merely hold it in trust for our children’s children, for all those who’ll come after us.

To flourish, we absolutely must do one thing with this trust, and that is to keep global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels — a point beyond which, scientists believe, lie the worst consequences of climate change, a world of recurring floods and droughts and fires and human misery. On this, we are failing, risking millenniums of human progress and indeed humanity’s future. Instead of real collective action, we continue to promise and to postpone, most recently in Glasgow, where the nations of the world gathered in the fall to talk yet again about the challenge of human-caused climate change. The words “last best chance” were thick in the air, but the words have grown stale: Despite repeated warnings going back decades, we are not addressing the greatest challenge the planet faces with anything approaching the response it requires.

Climate change is already here; it’s just not evenly distributed yet. Nor will it ever be. Many of the countries most vulnerable to effects of climate change have the least control over the warming of the planet, since they emit far less carbon dioxide. It is the responsibility of the United States and a relative handful of other great economic powers to answer, to respond, as collectively as possible, to the SOS that the planet is clearly sending.

None of this is unexpected. Thirty years ago, Margaret Thatcher, then Britain’s prime minister, sounded alarms in advance of the first big climate summit, in Rio de Janeiro, in 1992. Al Gore spoke with equal urgency before the Kyoto, Japan, summit in 1997, ditto President Obama before the Copenhagen summit in 2009. The New York Times’s editorial page used the “last best chance” formulation in anticipation of the 2015 summit in Paris.

The Forest Service would get billions of dollars to remove flammable vegetation from the lands it manages, in efforts to make wildfires less damaging.

To cope with the electricity shortfall, China and India turned to coal plants, and Colombia to natural gas.

In China, the worst-hit country, hydroelectricity generation saw the steepest fall in the past two decades, according to the I.E.A.

Climate change has plunged the Western U.S. into its worst drought in two decades. And a record-breaking heat wave only made things worse.

The levels in Lake Mead, which supplies water for millions of people, are at their lowest since the 1930s. In one California lake, the water was so shallow that officials spotted plane wreckage from a 1986 crash.

And that’s just in the U.S. Experts say global temperatures will keep rising as countries — and companies — fail to limit their planet-warming emissions. Smaller countries often pay the price for wealthier nations’ pollution through extreme weather. “Most of these gases have come from the United States, China, the European Union, Russia and other developed countries,” Bernard Ferguson writes.

The extent of acreage burned in 2022 is far less than what burned in 2021 and 2022, and looks more similar to what burned in 2019. 2020 was the most destructive fire year in the state’s history. 2022 2018 2021 2020 2019 McKinney fire 2020 was the state’s worst fire year on record.

When a string of wildfires broke out in California this spring, experts saw it as an unsettling preview of another destructive fire season to come — the consequence of forests and grasslands parched by persistent drought and higher temperatures fueled by climate change.

Yet, by the year’s end, California had managed to avoid widespread catastrophe. Wildfires have burned about 362,000 acres this year, compared with 2.5 million acres last year and a historic 4.3 million acres in 2020.

“It’s really just that we got lucky,” said Lenya Quinn-Davidson, a fire advisor for the University of California Cooperative Extension.

This year’s relatively mild wildfire season doesn’t mean that the landscape was much less vulnerable, that the forests were in better condition or that climate change had less of an effect on the intensity and behavior of wildfires than in previous years, Ms. Quinn-Davidson said. Instead, a combination of well-timed precipitation and favorable wind conditions seemed to play the biggest role.

The Mosquito fire, this year’s largest, started on Sept. 6 northeast of Sacramento during a record-breaking late-summer heat wave. But unusually early rains unleashed by a tropical storm in mid-September tempered the blaze and helped fire crews contain it.

California has seen larger, hotter and more intense wildfires in recent years, driven by extended drought and climate change. The five largest wildfires recorded in the state have all occurred since 2018. But California’s wildfire record is punctuated with both “good” and “bad” fire years — a result of short-term, natural weather variability.

Acres Burned by Wildfires in California A bar chart showing the total acres burned by California wildfires since 1987. A line for the 5-year moving average indicates that wildfires have been burning more acres of land in recent years, though 2022 represents a dip in the totals: 362,478 acres burned this year, compared with last year’s 2.5 million acres burned. 4 million acres 3 million 2 million Five-year moving average 362,478 acres burned in 2022 1 million 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 4 million acres 3 million 2 million Five-year moving average 1 million ’22 1990 2000 2010 2020 Source: The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CalFire

Warmer temperatures increase the potential for wildfires, once ignited, to intensify rapidly, spreading faster and scaling higher mountain elevations that might have otherwise been too wet or cool to support fierce fires. Extreme heat and drought, worsened by climate change, kill trees and dry out grass and pine needles, providing abundant fuel for a fire to spread over vast stretches of land.

A warming climate increases the likelihood of fires growing larger and more severe, but it’s not a guarantee that it will happen every year, said Andy Hoell, a climate researcher and meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Fires cannot start without a spark. Many are ignited either by lightning strikes or human activity, including untended campfires, unextinguished cigarettes, engine sparks and equipment malfunction. As humans continue to move into the wildland-urban interface, or fire-prone zones on the outskirts of cities, fires started this way will become more likely.

Once a fire is ignited, there are three major ingredients that shape its behavior, experts said: the landscape’s topography, weather (including wind and precipitation) and the availability of fuels. Climate change affects some, but not all, of those elements, said Hugh D. Safford, a fire ecologist at the University of California, Davis and chief scientist at Vibrant Planet, a climate tech company.

Usually, California’s fire season extends into October, and seasonal rain arrives later in the fall. But this year featured unusual storms in the summer and early fall that helped suppress dangerously growing wildfires, including the Mosquito and McKinney fires.

In Southern California, fires are often fanned by fast-moving, hot, dry winds known as the Santa Anas (also called Diablos in the northern part of the state). The winds dry out grasses and brush in the Sierra Nevada and pose the greatest fire risk in the fall, when vegetation is usually at its driest.

“We were fortunate this year that the rain started before the winds did,” said Chris Field, director of the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University.

While the state saw fewer acres burn this year than in the last two years, California still recorded comparable numbers of fire incidents. As a result, this year’s fires were much smaller on average.

In previous years, a number of California wildfires had grown to monstrous scales. When fires get large, they draw on more firefighting resources, which can mean fewer firefighters are available to respond to new, smaller fires when they ignite. Those smaller fires then have the opportunity to spread quickly and grow large, particularly in the early days of a fire’s development, said Robert Foxworthy, a firefighter and public information officer for CalFire, the state’s fire agency.

The Mosquito fire grew into the state’s largest of the year, burning through communities in the Sierra Nevada, before it was tempered by unexpected rains. Max Whittaker for The New York Times

Experts warned that looking at acreage burned doesn’t tell the full story of fire danger, and neither does frequency, although those are the statistics that are most readily and comprehensively available.

Those metrics do not describe lives lost, or trees, vegetation and buildings destroyed. And it doesn’t capture damage from flash floods like those that followed the McKinney fire, which triggered massive landslides and ultimately killed scores of fish in the Klamath River.

“A lot of times we get focused on the acreage and the fewer acres burned,” Ms. Quinn-Davidson said, adding that it was important not to lose sight of the several deadly and severe fires that did happen earlier in the year. “We still saw a level of severity that is outside of the historical range of variability,” she said.

To address its growing wildfire crisis, California has begun to ramp up plans for more prescribed burning, the practice of setting controlled, low-intensity burns to rid forests of small trees and brush that can end up fueling larger wildfires. However, forest management and fuel reduction practices had less of an impact on this year’s relatively mild wildfire season than fortunate weather conditions, said Dan McEvoy, a climatology researcher with the Desert Research Institute.

While California’s wildfire season was relatively mild compared to other years in recent memory, it was still destructive and deadly, killing nine people.

1700,2022-05-05,Will California’s New Water Conservation Measures Be Enough?,"For 15 years, Jeffrey Kightlinger was the general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which provides water to about 19 million people — nearly half of all Californians — across six counties, including Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego.

That water comes primarily from two sources. The California State Water Project draws snow runoff from the Sierra in Northern California, where this year the snowpack in some places was at just 5 percent of its average. And water also comes from the Colorado River and its Lake Mead and Lake Powell reservoirs, which are lower now than ever.

I spoke with Kightlinger, who retired in July, about whether we’ve crossed a permanent threshold of crisis. (We have, he said.) And whether the recently announced conservation measures, some of the strictest ever imposed, are enough. (They’re not.)

Here is our conversation, edited and condensed for clarity:

What’s the current situation for water in Southern California?

Very grim. The State Water Project is only delivering 5 percent. An acre-foot of water is 326,000 gallons. On average, you hope to get a million acre-feet out of it a year.

1702,2021-10-23,What Will Success Look Like in Glasgow?,"That every country pledged to help inspired a lot of high-fiving among the delegates in Paris, and deservedly so. It had taken a long time to persuade both rich and poor nations that a global problem required a global solution. But the delegates were under no illusion that these pledges would be enough to reach the 1.5 degree target. So they agreed to meet again in five years in order to assess progress and ratchet up those commitments. Glasgow is that meeting.

The lack of progress since Paris invites cynicism — at the very least, wariness — about Glasgow. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have since risen above annual averages of 400 parts per million, long seen as a dangerous threshold. In 2019 the world logged the most annual greenhouse gas emissions ever recorded, equivalent to more than 60 billion tons of carbon dioxide, a figure that includes methane and other climate-warming agents. The economic downturn caused by the Covid pandemic hardly moved the needle.

With only a week to go before the clamor begins in Glasgow, China, Australia, Russia and India have yet to make new pledges to cut their emissions. The Washington Post recently reported that Brazil and Mexico have put forward weaker targets than they submitted in Paris five years ago. Many of those that have submitted new pledges have promised rather vaguely to reach a goal of net-zero emissions by midcentury, which on paper would help keep warming within manageable limits but in practice will not do so unless followed up with real policies aimed at sharply reducing the use of fossil fuels, switching to cleaner sources of energy, electrifying cars and buildings and doing whatever else is necessary to decarbonize the world.

The question now is whether the delegates in Glasgow can rise above this pessimism and surprise us all with truly meaningful steps. Gloomy predictions to the contrary, several things have happened since Paris that should inspire everyone. For starters, the science of climate change has become tighter, tougher and more terrifying. In 2018 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a truly scary warning — what one U.N. official described as “a deafening, piercing smoke alarm going off in the kitchen.” The gist of it was that if the world had any hope of meeting the 1.5 degree threshold and thus avoiding ecological and social calamity, it must radically transform its energy systems not on any sort of leisurely glide path but in the next 12 years, which meant cutting greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030 and zeroing them out by 2050.

In case anyone missed the message, the I.P.C.C. repeated it in a no less alarming report in August of this year, a report that U.N. Secretary General António Guterres called a “code red for humanity.” The report warned that so much carbon dioxide had already been baked into the atmosphere that further major ecological and social damage — floods, droughts, famines, fires — was inevitable and the world should begin now to plan for it. Yet as the panel did in 2018, it opened a window of hope, arguing that with swift and sustained action to reduce the fossil fuels burned in cars, power plants and factories; vastly increase the use of renewable energy sources; and find other ways to decarbonize the planet, the world could stay within hailing distance of 1.5 degrees to avoid an even darker future.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,1,-0.7557,"['Russian Federation', 'Brazil', 'Mexico', 'Australia', 'United States', 'India', 'China']","['Paris', 'Glasgow']"

They come as farmers around the globe face an array of challenges, including drought and ice storms that have ruined crops, rising prices for fertilizer and fuel, and pandemic-related labor shortages and supply chain disruptions that make it difficult to get products to market.

A global index released on Thursday by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization showed food prices in January climbed to their highest level since 2011, when skyrocketing costs contributed to political uprisings in Egypt and Libya.

Maurice Obstfeld, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who was formerly chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said that food price increases would strain incomes in poorer countries, especially in some parts of Latin America and Africa, where some people may spend up to 50 or 60 percent of their income on food.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,1,-0.9607,"['Libya', 'Egypt']",[]

A powerful earthquake struck near the city of Cianjur on Indonesia’s main island, Java, yesterday, killing at least 162 people and injuring hundreds more. Many people were believed to be still trapped beneath the rubble, leading to fears that the death toll would rise. As far as 60 miles away, in the capital, Jakarta, the quake shook furniture and tall buildings. See photos from the disaster.

Emergency workers and others scrambled overnight to find trapped people, dealing with blocked roads, landslides and hundreds of collapsed buildings. Rescue efforts were hampered because the main hospital had been damaged and had lost electrical power, an official said. Many people, unable to reach medical care, were being treated wherever they had been injured, he added.

The quake was very shallow, occurring at a depth of only six miles, according to official records. Shallow quakes can often be more destructive than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, losing less energy along the way.

“I never expected them to do this to us, to beat us, fire at us and injure farmers,” he added.

For more than two weeks, Mr. Tavakoli and hundreds of other farmers had been protesting on the dry bed of the city’s storied Zayanderoud River. Tens of thousands of people had joined them in a show of solidarity.

Their demand: Restore water flows to the river to help irrigate farmlands laid to waste from years of mismanaging water resources.

“We have nothing left of our lands and livelihoods, we are just asking for our water rights,” said Mr. Tavakoli. He owns three hectares of farmland that was once lush with crops of wheat, barley, and vegetables. The land has been dry and barren for 15 months, forcing Mr. Tavakoli to sell his livestock to survive.

His “refusal to provide climate finance will deepen the crisis,” Mr. Singh added, “endangering lives and livelihoods — especially in regions least responsible for, yet most impacted by, climate change.”

The question of what rich countries owe to poor countries has been a sticking point in international climate talks for years. Wealthy areas like the United States and Europe have historically pumped more heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the air than others by burning coal, oil and gas, while poorer countries, such as those in Africa, are more vulnerable to climate disasters.

Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, wealthy nations agreed to provide significantly more financial aid to developing nations. The vast majority of that aid, however, goes toward helping countries reduce their greenhouse gases, such as by building solar or wind farms.

But as global emissions keep rising and as the planet gets hotter, the necessity of adapting to heat waves, floods, sea level rise and other effects of climate change is getting more attention. Adaptation aid from wealthy nations and development banks jumped to $28 billion in 2022 from $21 billion in 2021.

Climate adaptation can include planting drought-resistant crops, raising buildings to avoid flood damage or moving communities away from coastlines.

Lake Powell, upstream on the Arizona-Utah border, is 23 percent full, the lowest since it filled in the 1960s.

We had taken a leisurely drive from Los Angeles, stopped for enchiladas in a tiny restaurant tucked amid fruit orchards, sat on a rock and watched a squirrel take apart its food in the shade of these giant old trees. We learned that sequoias, native to the western Sierra Nevada, are some of the oldest, most adaptive trees of North America. They can survive extreme drought, heat, cold. They reproduce through fire.

But as the teenager pointed out, even some of the toughest creatures have their breaking point.

The Northeast and parts of the northern Rockies and Southern California had extremely wet summers, while the Southwest had one of its driest on record, he said.

That stress can make trees lose their leaves earlier, but it can also make the leaf color “really pop,” said Tara L. Bal, a forestry professor at Michigan Tech. When leaves and trees are stressed, she explained, “the bright reds and oranges and yellows actually are stronger.”

1721,2024-02-28,The World May Be Entering a Much Bloodier Era,"There may be a contagion effect, too, in which one coup provides a permission structure for the next, though as Singh notes, historically juntas have operated less according to external logic than internal motivation. And while many American commentators blame the end of a Pax Americana and a resulting vacuum of geopolitical leadership, those closer to the Sahel tend to see the American war on terrorism, particularly the U.S.-led invasion of Libya in 2011, as a major contributor to regional instability. On the ground, animosity toward the French is also pervasive, and there is influence jockeying and obvious strategic meddling by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar, along with widespread suspicion about Russia (with its state-funded military contractor the Wagner group recently rebranding on the continent).

The past few years have been especially difficult ones across the Sahel, with the pandemic and Covid recessions and a surge in hunger partly driven by the war in Ukraine. Public revenues have fallen, countries are struggling through sovereign debt crises, and inflation has been soaring. Islamist militants, now largely forgotten or ignored by civilians in the United States, continue to be a source of Sahelian instability, with the failure to contain them in certain countries widely seen as an indictment of existing elites. There are generational dynamics at play, too, with booming youth populations increasingly frustrated with older leadership regimes and demographic ones as well, with rapid and disorderly urbanization from an increasingly harsh and conflict-ridden agricultural countryside.

I think it’s also worth flagging another possible contributor: climate change.

Climate researchers have long projected that the Sahel would be one of the regions most threatened by the impacts of warming. The Institute for Economics and Peace has identified the Sahel as one of its ecological threat hot spots, and according to Notre Dame’s Global Adaptation Initiative’s index, all six countries in the region rank among the least prepared places in the world. Writing for the Council on Foreign Relations in 2022, Beza Tesfaye noted that “Sahelian countries are simultaneously among the most affected by climate change and the least prepared to adapt,” an observation underlined last year by the I.M.F. as well. And in November 2022 the United Nations warned that climate impacts could bring about political instability and further conflict in 10 nations of the greater Sahel. In the last five years, those 10 nations have experienced a total of eight attempted or successful coups.

Across the region, environmental struggle has profoundly shaped a half-century of history, but the recent disruptions are nevertheless significant. In Niger, there have been nine droughts and five major flooding events in the last 20 years, with food crises every four years and many parts of the country without a good harvest in a decade. In 2022, an intense rainy season produced devastating flooding in Mali and Chad, events the World Weather Attribution network estimated were made 80 times more likely by climate change. Southeast of the coup belt, a three-year drought in the Horn of Africa has left more than four million people in need of humanitarian assistance; according to the W.W.A.’s “conservative estimate,” the drought was made 100 times more likely by climate change.

These disasters aren’t the source of all of the recent political turmoil. As in many unstable parts of the world, climate change may not be directly causing political disruptions, but it is pressuring already fragile systems. “The patient, as it were, is suffering from lots of different kinds of ailments,” the political scientist Kenneth Schultz told me. “But this is another one.” Last August, Roland Ngam, of the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation, wrote in South Africa’s Daily Maverick that “behind all the coups” are “weak institutions and especially climate change which has caused a massive ecosystem collapse over the last century.” And in November Abdoulie Ceesay, the deputy majority leader of the Gambian National Assembly, wrote in The New Internationalist: “The simple fact is that the rise of militarism has gone hand in hand with the rise in poverty, food insecurity, economic crises and extreme weather.

Preventing further warming is within reach, but would require a coordinated and immediate worldwide effort, the report found.

The Mississippi’s current is typically strong enough to prevent seawater from the Gulf of Mexico from moving upriver. But it’s a challenge that gets harder each year as global warming causes sea level in the Gulf to rise while coastal subsidence causes the riverbed to sink. The equilibrium broke down as the Midwest endured another exceptionally hot and dry year. Freshwater river levels fell, allowing the seawater to march upriver.

The broader Mississippi watershed has endured consecutive years of drought. According to data from the U.S. Drought Monitor, dry conditions have persisted across western regions of the upper basin since 2020. Since May, those drought conditions have deeply affected the states in the Midwest, which feed the river downstream.

“It’s really the areas in the Midwest, in the Ohio Valley, that really play a role in whether we get high or low water conditions on the lower part of the Mississippi,” said Jeffrey Graschel, hydrologist at the National Weather Service in Slidell, La.

The lower Mississippi is isolated by levees and doesn’t have large tributaries feeding into it. “When it rains in the state of Mississippi or in Louisiana, it doesn’t actually go into the river at all,” he said.

Below average rainfall and a record-hot summer have parched the central and eastern parts of the Mississippi River Basin. The western areas have had rainfall, but much of it is captured in reservoirs and doesn’t reach Louisiana.

In a year of record-breaking heat worldwide, much of the basin has also been much hotter than average.

According to NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, Louisiana just had both its driest and hottest August on record. The next few weeks in the lower Mississippi Valley are expected to be a continuation of that hot and dry weather, although the prospects for rain are higher in seasonal outlooks through the end of the calendar year.

While there’s a good chance of some rain in the next two weeks, according to the National Weather Service precipitation outlook, a huge amount will be needed to stop the saltwater creeping upriver.

Because salty water is heavier and sinks while freshwater flows over top, it creates a wedge shape as the mixture moves upriver. The Army Corps of Engineers is currently raising an underwater sediment shelf near Myrtle Grove as part of the mitigation response, since even a submerged barrier could block saltwater at the bottom of the river. But ocean water has already crept over the top of that sill and through a notch cut out for ship traffic.

“The sill augmentation is not going to stop the saltwater from progressing upriver,” said Matthew Roe, spokesman for the Army Corps. “It’s just going to delay the impacts that we see, and give the parishes and state more time to get their plans in place.”

Residents downstream have already had to switch to bottled water while the Army Corps tries to secure a plan to ship fresher water from upstream to lower the salinity levels to a point where water can be treated for public consumption.

The low-water season typically runs from May through the end of October. Once temperatures cool, the river should start to rebound. “In a typical year, we typically don’t see low water conditions improving for our area until we start to get into November,” Mr. Graschel said.

By then it may be too late, because the saltwater will already have hit the intake valves for the New Orleans public water supply.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,scientific report,0,0,2,0.8514,"['United States', 'Mexico']","['Carrollton', 'Myrtle Grove', 'Orleans', 'New Orleans', 'Slidell']"

katrin bennhold

From “The New York Times,” I’m Katrin Bennhold. This is “The Daily.” [MUSIC PLAYING] Many of the effects of climate change are already with us — heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, flooding. But some of the most alarming consequences are hiding beneath the surface of the ocean. Today, my colleagues David Gelles and Raymond Zhong on just how close we might be to a tipping point. It’s Tuesday, May 7. David, you’ve been writing about different aspects of climate change for years and are definitely no stranger to distressing news about a warming planet. But something about ocean temperatures seems particularly distressing. What’s going on?

david gelles

Starting last year, scientists started noting something alarming happening in oceans all around the world. It was warm in the oceans, but it started to get really hot in ways that they had never seen before. And for the last year-plus, I’ve been checking in with scientists. And they are increasingly concerned, perplexed even, with what they’re seeing.

katrin bennhold

And when you say oceans are getting hotter, can you just give me a sense of how much the oceans are warming and how fast?

david gelles

Well, if you look at a chart that shows, say, the last two or three decades of average sea surface temperatures, you’ll see a gradual warming trend. But starting last March, we didn’t see another gradual increase. We saw this big jump. And from March of 2023 on, it stayed hot. And it’s just getting hotter. And we began 2024 at this much higher level than we’ve ever seen before. And we’re still there. And in many parts of the world, the temperatures are still going up as we head into summer. And that has scientists really concerned.

katrin bennhold

And you said earlier that none of the scientists that you’ve been checking in with and none of these very sophisticated climate models that they’re operating with can explain this big jump. And I guess I have to ask at this point, why are these scientists so surprised? I mean, we’ve seen record-breaking heat waves for the past several years. It seems like every single year is hotter than the last. Why is it any surprise that the ocean is no different?

david gelles

Well, they’re not surprised that the ocean is warming. They have understood for many years now that the overall man-made global warming that we’re experiencing all over the world in all these different ways is going to affect the oceans. Water is very absorbent for heat, and a lot of the extra heat that we’re producing from the burning of fossil fuels, a lot of the extra heat that’s being caused in the atmosphere as a result of that is just getting sucked in to the ocean. And bit by bit, over the last many decades, the oceans have gotten warmer.

katrin bennhold

So even after the air cools, say, in winter or something, the ocean holds on to a portion of that heat?

david gelles

That’s right. Even when it’s cold outside, the oceans, year after year, have been getting a little warmer as a result of climate change.

katrin bennhold

But that on its own does not account for the kind of warming that we’re seeing right now?

david gelles

Not even close.

katrin bennhold

So what else do they think could be going on?

david gelles

Well, for the last year or so, the Pacific Ocean has been going through an El Niño cycle, which is when a lot of excess heat is released from the ocean. And in addition to making the Pacific Ocean hotter, it has sort of an overall warming nudge, a little boost for warmth in ocean heat around the world. But even that doesn’t explain the big jumps we’ve seen. And there’s another counterintuitive factor that scientists believe is playing a role here as well, and that has everything to do with the pollution being emitted by big ocean liners, by big ships traveling across the Atlantic. [MUSIC PLAYING] So in 2020, some shipping regulations changed. And they required that the emissions from the fuel being used in big ocean tankers become much cleaner. And as a result of that, there was less sulfur dioxide in the shipping emissions. That’s a good thing for many reasons. Sulfur dioxide is a pollutant. It can have really adverse health effects on humans. But one of the things it was also doing was refracting sunlight away from the oceans. And so what we’ve seen over the last recent years is, as there was less sulfur dioxide in the North Atlantic, as less and less of that particulate matter was in the atmosphere and able to bounce the sun’s energy back into space, more and more of the sun’s energy, more and more of the sun’s heat was making its way into the oceans. And that, scientists are now understanding, likely played a warming role as well.

katrin bennhold

So basically, lower emissions in these shipping lanes means less kind of smoggy cloud cover and, therefore, more direct sunlight hitting the ocean surface and heating it up, which actually kind of rings a bell. Because we talked about this in the show recently in relation to scientists wanting to artificially create more potent cloud cover to cool down the planet. It’s a little ironic that scientists are now trying to engineer the very thing we were trying to stop doing. Talk about unintended consequences.

david gelles

That’s right. And this is one of those instances where there are these very tough trade-offs, right? It’s great, yes, that we have less pollution. That’s going to be good for public health. On the other hand, it may have allowed yet more warming in the oceans that’s having cascading effects across all sorts of ecosystems that we’re only just beginning to understand.

katrin bennhold

Yeah. Let’s talk about that for a moment. What are the effects of this mysterious warming? You mentioned ecosystems.

david gelles

Well, there are a lot of effects when the oceans get this hot this fast. But perhaps the most immediate concern among people all over the world is the fact that in dozens and dozens of countries all over the world, we’re experiencing a record wave of coral bleaching, which is to say that coral reefs, these vitally important parts of the ocean ecosystems, are just dying at a rate we’ve never really seen before. And that’s going to have all sorts of negative effects for fisheries all over the globe.

katrin bennhold

Why are coral reefs so important?

david gelles

Well, they matter for a lot more than just snorkeling. Yes, they’re beautiful. And yes, they are the center of a lot of tourist activity. But they’re also sort of this fundamental, foundational part of the marine food chain. And so when we think about all of the life that coral reefs sustain, that all allows for smaller fish to flourish and go out into the ocean. And those smaller fish contribute to the lives and the ecosystems of bigger fish. And when we think back to the food chain that we learned about when we were in elementary school, coral reefs are right at the bottom of that. And if we lose that, it’s going to have devastating effects for marine ecosystems all over the world.

katrin bennhold

Is there any hope to save the coral at this point, or are they doomed?

david gelles

My colleague Catrin Einhorn has been doing a lot of great reporting on the situation with corals. And she’s highlighted some of the efforts underway to try to save them, to grow more resilient corals. But the truth is, the scale we’re seeing, with bleaching events happening all around the world in something like 56 countries, it’s just not possible to stop it entirely at this point.

katrin bennhold

So it’s one of these dominoes in our ecosystem that can set off a whole range of problems and actually result in major losses to biodiversity.

david gelles

And just to come back to the mystery of it all, we just don’t know what happens when those dominoes start to fall. And it’s not just corals that are being impacted here. The weather could well change as a result of these warmer oceans as well. And I’m particularly thinking about the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season. Warm water is a key ingredient to hurricanes. When you think about hurricanes and how strong they get and how fast they intensify, one of the most important factors in both of those dynamics is how hot the water is. And when we see all this warm water hanging out in the Atlantic Ocean, that is leading forecasters to predict a potentially record-breaking hurricane season that is right around the corner in the North Atlantic. And that could affect the Caribbean, North America, and beyond.

katrin bennhold

What’s striking to me is that we know that the oceans are getting much hotter. We don’t fully know why, and we can’t fully explain what the impact will be, which really doesn’t sound great. But if we don’t fully understand what’s going on, then how can we even hope to do something about it?

david gelles

Well, I’ve been asking scientists this very question. Like, what is there to be done? And the tough answer is, there’s no easy way to turn down the thermostat of the oceans. This warming is happening. And our job now is to live with it as best we can. [MUSIC PLAYING] And we haven’t even talked about what some people regard as the biggest threat of all. As the oceans warm, they’re contributing to the melting of glaciers and the loss of Arctic sea ice. And as that happens, many people are worried not just about rising sea levels but also about the disruption to a vitally important ocean current. And if that happens, it could have massive ramifications for the entire planet. It could change just about everything we know about life on Earth.

katrin bennhold

After the break, my colleague Raymond Zhong talks about the possibility of that ocean current collapsing. We’ll be right back. Raymond, before the break, our colleague David Gelles told us all about this alarming trend of the ocean heating up and some of the very worrying consequences of that. But you are here to tell us about something else that may be happening in the ocean, something to do with ocean currents. And if I’m honest, it sounds like something straight out of a science-fiction movie. Can you explain?

raymond zhong

Sure, Katrin. And actually, you’re right. It is something from a science-fiction movie. [CHANTING]

archived recording 1 I’m here at the global warming conference in New Delhi, where, if you can believe your eyes, it’s snowing.

raymond zhong

About 20 years ago, a movie called “The Day After Tomorrow” came out.

archived recording 2 The only force strong enough to affect global weather is the sun. archived recording 3 What about the North Atlantic Current? I got a call last night from Professor Rapson at the Hedland Center. He thinks the current has changed. [MURMURING] archived recording 2 Oh, come on, Jack. How could that be?

raymond zhong

And the plot of that movie is that there’s this major ocean current in the Atlantic that — it suddenly stops moving. It collapses. And it sets off this cascade of natural disasters —

archived recording 4 In Nova Scotia earlier today, the ocean rose by 25 feet in a matter of seconds. archived recording 5 What you’re seeing are two actual tornadoes striking Los Angeles International Airport. archived recording 6 It’s a mob scene here at Grand Central Station. Over half the platforms are flooded, and service has suspended on all trains.

raymond zhong

— that ultimately plunge the planet into a new ice age.

archived recording 3 What can we do? archived recording 7 Save as many as you can.

katrin bennhold

I guess my question to you, Raymond, given what we’re talking about here is, which part of that movie is science fiction, and which part is actual science?

raymond zhong

I’d say most of the movie is pretty purely fiction. But there is a kernel of truth in the science, which is that this vital ocean current in the Atlantic is very real. And just like in the movie, scientists are worried about what happens if it shuts down.

katrin bennhold

OK. So tell me about this current.

raymond zhong

Scientists have given it a very, very unwieldy name. [MUSIC PLAYING] They call it the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. But most people just use the acronym AMOC. AMOC.

katrin bennhold

AMOC, OK.

raymond zhong

Think of it as a giant conveyor belt of water that loops around the Atlantic Ocean. And it starts near the equator, goes up through the Caribbean, around the East Coast of the US, up toward Northern Europe, and then back again. Scientists have come to realize how important AMOC is for a lot of the climate that we enjoy today. A lot of Northern Europe — Britain, Iceland, Scandinavia — is habitable today, really, because of AMOC. It’s because this system transports heat from the equator and very generously drops it off in Northern Europe — that even though it’s so far from the equator, it’s not as uninhabitable as, say, far Northern Canada or Siberia.

katrin bennhold

And let me just ask you, is this AMOC current the same thing as the Gulf Stream, which people write about and are worried about a lot these days?

raymond zhong

Yeah, the Gulf Stream is a similar system of currents. But AMOC is the full loop. The Gulf Stream is just one part of it, but AMOC is really what’s important for the climate.

katrin bennhold

OK. So before we talk about AMOC shutting down or collapsing, can you actually kind of give me a quick science 101 explanation of how this thing works? Like, there’s this massive loop of water, like, I guess, an underwater river that you described which kind of transports warm water up towards the north and then comes back as cold water. What keeps this thing running? How does a current just stay in constant motion and loop around like that?

raymond zhong

It has to do primarily with differences in temperature and salinity. Basically, fluids want to keep moving in a particular direction. And it’s driven by this balance between warm water, cold water, salty water, fresh water. Heavier water wants to sink. Lighter water wants to rise. And so the temperature and salinity of the water is sort of what determines how dense it is. And this density and differences in density keeps this giant loop moving. It’s something that explorers noted in the Atlantic hundreds of years ago. They noticed that deep water was very cold. It was unexpected. And so I think as people have started studying the oceans more and science has advanced, they’ve realized there’s a very delicate system of differences in temperature and salinity that keeps this conveyor belt moving.

katrin bennhold

That’s really fascinating. I mean, I’ve always known we had these currents and that they were really important, but I never really appreciated and understood what it takes to keep them going. So, OK, tell me why scientists are so worried about AMOC shutting down.

raymond zhong

As the planet warms, there’s something that might be significantly affecting this delicate balance. And that’s the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. With the melting of the ice, there’s this big infusion of fresh water into the northern Atlantic. And because that affects the salinity of the northern Atlantic, it sort of changes the balance of salinity and temperature, potentially enough to knock this loop off course. And there’s signs already that this is happening, that at least the current is slowing down. And one major piece of evidence is this cold blob that’s appeared in the northern Atlantic.

katrin bennhold

A cold blob?

raymond zhong

A cold blob, that’s right. With most almost everywhere on the planet getting warmer because of the greenhouse gases that we’re putting into the atmosphere, there’s a conspicuous blob in the North Atlantic, near Greenland, that is getting cooler. And it’s exactly the place that scientists would expect to be getting cooler if AMOC were slowing down.

katrin bennhold

OK. So the Greenland ice sheet is melting due to climate change, and that seems to be disrupting this current. So as a result, less warm water is being transported north, and that’s why we have this cold blob that scientists have noticed in the North Atlantic.

raymond zhong

That’s right.

katrin bennhold

And do we know what would happen if the current collapsed today?

raymond zhong

So the best source of information we have about what happens when AMOC collapses comes from about 12,800 years ago — [MUSIC PLAYING] — which is, as far as scientists know, the last major time this happened. Basically, the climate changed really, really quickly, at least by geological time. It was sort of less than 100 years, as far as scientists know. Much of the Northern Hemisphere got cold again. The temperature in parts of Greenland probably fell by about 18 degrees Fahrenheit. Forests were replaced by tundra. Ice sheets grew again. As far away as California and the Southwestern US, you had evidence of cooler, drier conditions. And as far as scientists can tell, this may even have contributed to the disappearance of some of our early hunter-gatherer civilizations. Some of our ancestors were probably pushing into new territory as the ice sheets retreated and were suddenly confronted with another blast of cold. [MUSIC PLAYING]

katrin bennhold

Wow. OK. So the last time this happened, this current shutdown, the world was basically plunged into an ice age and wiped out part of humanity. Is that the scenario we’re looking at today?

raymond zhong

I think scientists are careful about not being too precise about what it would look like if it happened again. The world, after all, is still warming. And so in a lot of ways, the climate is already quite different from the one that was around at the time. But certainly, I think scientists expect Northern Europe — the UK, Iceland, Scandinavia — to become a much colder place even than it was 200 years ago, before the Industrial Revolution, before humans started adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.

katrin bennhold

How cold are we talking? You mentioned the UK. I’m in the UK right now. I mean, would Britain suddenly look like the frozen tundra?

raymond zhong

It would be significantly colder. It’s far north enough to really be almost Arctic. And I think an AMOC collapse could bring much stronger winter storms, deep cold in the winter that would be extremely dangerous. But at the same time, that cold around the North Atlantic doesn’t just translate straightforwardly into cold everywhere. Basically, if you don’t have AMOC, you have more heat that stays around the tropics and the equator. A warm ocean around the equator gives the fuel to storms around the equator and rainfall around the equator.

katrin bennhold

So it’s not just about getting that warm water from the tropics to Europe. It’s also getting that warm water away from the tropics to avoid things like extreme weather events.

raymond zhong

That’s right. And it’s not just about the temperatures people would experience. It’s also about agriculture. And especially in vulnerable places like Africa, big shifts in rainfall, big shifts in temperature could really affect food chains, food supplies, our ability to feed ourselves.

katrin bennhold

And what does that mean for humans living in these places? Like, you were saying that, 13,000 years ago, Northern Europe basically wasn’t inhabitable anymore. Would humans still be able to live in these places?

raymond zhong

We, as a civilization, as a species, obviously have some ability to withstand a range of temperatures, a range of weather conditions. But we really haven’t seen, in our recent history, at least, changes as fast as the ones scientists imagine an AMOC collapse would bring. It’s really hard to say, is Northern Europe ready for a much colder climate than it is right now? If, for instance, sea level rise accelerates on the East Coast of the US, are cities there prepared? That’s another consequence of AMOC that scientists are worried about. And it’s obviously already happening. And you can see the effects of sea level rise in places like the Gulf Coast, North Carolina, Florida, even New York. But certainly, it would be a test for countries, societies around the northern Atlantic that they haven’t seen before.

katrin bennhold

OK. That’s a very scary prospect with everything that goes with it — mass floods and displacement of people, climate migration — everything that you can imagine. When do scientists predict that this could actually happen based on the data they have and assuming, of course, current human behavior and emissions don’t change?

raymond zhong

As best as scientists can tell right now, they know AMOC is weakening. They expect it to continue weakening. Whether a collapse is imminent, whether it’s far away is still really, really hard to say. But it couldn’t quickly be reversed. Once you started on this process, the system just keeps moving in that direction.

katrin bennhold

Like a point of no return?

raymond zhong

That’s right.

katrin bennhold

So if we’re already seeing signs that this current is weakening, does that mean we’re possibly already past that point of no return? Is it no longer a matter of if but when?

raymond zhong

The really short answer is, we just don’t know. The best guess is that it’s not going to shut down this century. But plenty of scientists are worried. It’s something that a lot of them are focused on very intensely, just because we do think the consequences, if AMOC did shut down, could be so catastrophic.

katrin bennhold

If that current collapsed, though, is there anything we could do to bring it back? Like, it did come back 13,000 years ago after that last ice age. What happened?

raymond zhong

Short answer again, nobody is quite sure. It seems to have abruptly grown warm again over 40, 50 years. But it’s pretty unclear why. And I think as far as what would happen today to bring it back, scientists would still say cutting greenhouse gas emissions and preventing the planet from overheating is probably the only thing we have in our control that could influence the climate on that scale.

katrin bennhold

I mean, it’s sort of where we land at the end of every episode about climate change. And it’s sort of interesting. I mean, probably like a lot of people listening to you, I find all this pretty scary and dystopian and worrying. It’s kind of crazy to think, actually, that scientists have warned about this for decades, that there was even a science-fiction movie made 20 years ago, which, in some ways, predicted what might be the real consequences of this current shutting down. It’s not like we humans lack the imagination of all the terrible things we’re risking here. But when it comes to protecting ourselves and the planet against this existential threat, we are clearly unwilling to do what it takes.

raymond zhong

Yeah. Scientists have been thinking about AMOC and had a pretty good grasp of what AMOC looked like decades ago. As early as the ‘80s and ‘90s, scientists made this connection between the warming that humans were bringing about and consequences like an AMOC collapse and other things as well. [MUSIC PLAYING] It was one of the scientists who wrote about AMOC in the ‘80s who said, “The climate system is an angry beast, and we are poking it with sticks.” And that’s still true today.

katrin bennhold

Well, Raymond, thank you very much.

raymond zhong

Thank you, Katrin. [MUSIC PLAYING]

1732,2022-07-22,Utah’s ‘Environmental Nuclear Bomb’,"sabrina tavernise

From “The New York Times,”’ I’m Sabrina Tavernise. This is “The Daily.” [MUSIC PLAYING] The Great Salt Lake in Utah is drying up, creating a bowl of toxic dust that threatens to poison the air in one of the nation’s fastest growing metro areas. Today my colleague Christopher Flavelle on the struggle to avert that catastrophe. It’s Friday, July 22. So, Chris, you cover climate for “The New York Times.” Tell me why you decided to go to Utah.

christopher flavelle

So at the beginning of the year, I started hearing stories about what’s happening with the Great Salt Lake, and in particular this fear that it was beginning to dry up.

archived recording 1 Our top story this morning, the levels of the Great Salt Lake have tied the record low that was set back in 1963.

christopher flavelle

They hit a record low last summer —

archived recording 1 This week, the Great Salt Lake has been flirting with historic low levels.

christopher flavelle

— which caused everyone to suddenly sit up and pay attention —

archived recording 2 Utah Governor Spencer Cox has now declared a state of emergency and called on the people of Utah to reduce their water use and pray for rain.

christopher flavelle

— and start to ask themselves, what would actually happen if this lake disappeared?

sabrina tavernise

OK, so let’s start with the lake itself. When you say the name, I think Utah, because of Salt Lake City. But otherwise, I’m not sure I know very much about this lake.

christopher flavelle

Sure.

archived recording 3 Covering 1,700 square miles, it’s the largest American lake west of the Mississippi.

christopher flavelle

Picture a gargantuan body of water that really defines the northern half of Utah.

archived recording 3 What makes Great Salt Lake so unique is that its water is up to five times saltier than the ocean.

christopher flavelle

It is, as the name suggests, heavily salty.

archived recording 4 The Eastern shore of Great Salt Lake is America’s Serengeti for migratory birds.

christopher flavelle

So birds that are flying across the continent stop here for food.

archived recording 5 This lake is not just a landmark, though. It is a linchpin for our ecology, the ecology of a region where most Utahans live.

christopher flavelle

A crucial part of the landscape in terms of weather patterns.

archived recording 5 It protects us from dust storms. It helps our snowpack.

christopher flavelle

It helps increase precipitation and snowfall in the mountains, which increases water supply for those who live there.

archived recording 5 And it also powers over a billion dollars of Utah’s economy.

christopher flavelle

And it’s an important part of the psyche and the identity of Salt Lake City and Utah. So it would be hard to overstate just how important this lake is for a lot of reasons.

sabrina tavernise

Got it. So you said there was a fear that the lake might actually dry up completely. So what would happen if the lake did actually dry up?

christopher flavelle

One of the state lawmakers I met with, who is a Republican, said it would be like an environmental nuclear bomb going off if this lake disappeared.

sabrina tavernise

Wow.

christopher flavelle

So I realized I had to see the lake for myself, and also get a better idea of what’s causing it to shrink and what people are doing about it, trying to save it. So one of the first things I did when I landed in Salt Lake City was I drove out to the lake. But even before you see anything else, something looks wrong. Right, you’re looking out of the side of the causeway and you see these vast expanses of dry land. And it’s a kind of dry land that doesn’t really fit any framework that I had. It’s not soil. It’s not sand. There’s clearly no vegetation. It just looks wrong. So I drive past these empty expanses and meet Kevin Perry —

kevin perry If we go a little bit further south, we can get a really nice perspective of what used to be lake, which is completely dry.

christopher flavelle

— a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Utah.

sabrina tavernise

And what did he tell you?

christopher flavelle

He described two big challenges that are causing the lake to shrink.

kevin perry It’s mostly due to the fact that we divert too much water for other purposes.

christopher flavelle

The first is how much water humans are pulling from rivers and streams before that water gets to the lake water.

kevin perry The water that’s being diverted, what’s it being diverted for? 70 percent of it’s being diverted for agriculture. 15 percent is for cities. And 15 percent is for industry.

christopher flavelle

So think of the watershed around the Great Salt Lake as sort of a perfect miniature system. You’ve got precipitation falling in the mountains above Salt Lake City as snow. And that snow melts, feeding rivers and streams. And eventually those rivers and streams empty into the Great Salt Lake. But along the way you get people diverting that water, with a massive amount going to agriculture. And what’s changing now is you’re seeing a huge population boom in Salt Lake City that’s making things worse, pulling even more water away from the lake. It’s one of the fastest growing areas in the country. And when you’re there, you can feel it. You can see new subdivisions sprouting all the time at the edge of the metropolis. It’s almost literally getting bigger as you watch it.

sabrina tavernise

So as more people come to Salt Lake City, and a lot are coming, this diversion problem gets worse.

christopher flavelle

Exactly. But even as that’s happening, you’ve got a separate challenge, an interlocking set of problems related to climate change. The Western United States is facing a severe drought. And that’s really shorthand for two things. One is less precipitation, which means less snowpack forming in the first place.

kevin perry So we’re having a fairly poor snowpack this year. We’re 80 percent of normal. So if we were at 100 percent of normal on snowpack, we divert so much water that the lake would still shrink another foot next year.

christopher flavelle

And the other one is heat. Higher temperatures mean that even if the snowpack does form, you’ve got more of that snow evaporating due to high heat.

kevin perry Well, last year, the spring runoff, we got 6 inches of water in the lake. And we still lost 2 feet. So we went down a foot and a half last year.

christopher flavelle

So it’s not just less precipitation. It’s that once the snow falls, more of it is being lost back into the air. And less of it is entering these tributaries to begin with.

sabrina tavernise

Got it. So it basically evaporates as opposed to turning into water and flowing into the lake.

christopher flavelle

Exactly right.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so between population growth, drought, and rising temperatures, this lake is really facing a crisis. So, Chris, how much longer do we expect the Great Salt Lake to actually exist?

christopher flavelle

The short answer and the reason this is so scary is no one really knows how long we might have left until this lake disappears. But the better question, and maybe the scarier question, is how long until the negative effects of that lake shrinking start to be felt? And on that point, the really scary answer is they might have started already. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

OK, so let’s talk about those effects. Walk me through what’s happening.

christopher flavelle

Well, let’s start with the economic consequences. One of the reasons that this lake is so important is it helps increase the amount of snow that falls in the ski resorts above Salt Lake City.

kevin perry So the snow that we get in October and November, December would be primarily lake-effect snow. And that’s what you need to jumpstart your season.

christopher flavelle

Really, really great ski resorts that are a big tourism driver for the local economy. Not only that, but as lake shrinks, it hurts the mineral extraction industries.

kevin perry But it’s the only source of magnesium metal for the United States. christopher flavelle Really? kevin perry Yes.

christopher flavelle

So you’ve got a lot of money in Utah coming from companies that can use this water to extract minerals like magnesium from it. So as the lake shrinks, that starts to go away. The second one is the ecological consequences. The Great Salt Lake is a massively important stopover. You hear the number of 10 million migratory birds stopping here.

kevin perry The base of the food chain is the brine flies and the brine shrimp.

christopher flavelle

They all congregate at this lake because it’s a source of food.

kevin perry And when the lake hits 19 percent salinity, then the brine shrimp have to spend so much energy expelling salt that they can no longer reproduce. And at that point, the food chain collapses.

christopher flavelle

Kevin Perry said 19 percent, but a different expert I spoke with said that number could be as low as 17 percent salt content. And the lake is expected to hit that number this summer, right now.

sabrina tavernise

So what you’re saying, Chris, is that there are a lot of fates tied to this lake. I mean, there’s the fate of agriculture, the mining industry, tourism, and the fate of the environment.

christopher flavelle

Exactly, but we haven’t gotten to the worst part yet. It’s also the people who breathe the air around the Great Salt Lake, because what is trapped in the earth underneath this lake is very hazardous heavy metals. I’m talking about things like arsenic, antimony, copper, zirconium, things that you do not want in your body and that you do not want in your lungs. And as the lake disappears, those metals and the soil they’re trapped in become exposed. And then as you get dust storms and wind pulling that soil that dirt off the exposed lake bed, moving it into the air, and eventually into the lung tissue of people who live in Salt Lake City. And that could be the most serious concern and serious consequence as the lake dries up.

sabrina tavernise

Can people die from inhaling it? I mean, how dangerous is it?

christopher flavelle

Yeah, so there’s two specific threats that are different, but both worrisome. There’s an acute threat, which is as this dust gets kicked up from this exposed lake bed, it can cause really serious breathing problems, especially for those who have chronic conditions, like asthma or COPD. But long term, you have a separate thing, which is some of these heavy metals are carcinogens. And over time, they can start to — cases of cancer in people who are exposed to them. And so you’ve got both an immediate shock as the supply of dust increases and a long-term problem as rates of serious diseases, like cancer, could very well increase with perennial exposure to these chemicals in the air.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so this is crazy, I mean, the bottom of the lake coming up and effectively poisoning the air. This sounds incredibly dangerous and potentially catastrophic, both for people in the state of Utah and for wildlife that depends on the lake. And the remarkable thing is that it’s not happening at some point in the distant future. It’s happening now.

christopher flavelle

Not only is it happening now, but we know where it’s going, or at least where it could go, because this isn’t the first time the situation has come up. Not too far west of the Great Salt Lake is another lake in California called Owens Lake, which went through a very similar situation, not due to climate change, but because the river that feeds the lake was diverted to provide drinking water for Los Angeles. After that happened, Owens Lake dried up. And it became the worst source of dust pollution in the United States, requiring enormous spending in the billions of dollars to try to hold that dust down, pretty much killing a community on the shore of that lake, what used to be the shore of that lake, and also providing a really, really stark warning that if you let these lakes dry out, the results are catastrophic. Now, what’s different is the Great Salt Lake is many times bigger than Owens Lake used to be, number one. Number two, it’s right next to one of the Great Western American cities, Salt Lake City. And so if what happened in the Great Salt Lake were similar to what happened with Owens Lake, the consequences are almost too severe to imagine. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. So, Chris, you’ve just painted a pretty dire picture of Utah’s future if things keep going the way that they’re going. I mean, you said it will put 2/3 of the state’s population in pretty immediate risk. How much do local officials understand the severity of this? And what are they doing about it?

christopher flavelle

Well, there’s no question that state and local officials are aware of the problem. In this year’s state legislative session, state lawmakers really aggressively focused on the problem of the Great Salt Lake and passed a series of bills that are designed to begin to address the problem, things like beginning to make it easier to trade water rights or sell water rights to their highest and best use, compelling local governments to account for water needs in planning, trying to put some pressure on builders to account for how they use water and things like appliances and homes. But none of the laws that were passed in this year’s session by themselves will really be enough to address this problem. So for the moment, the actors that matter the most here are local officials, and particular local officials who have authority over drinking water.

laura briefer So back when Salt Lake City was initially being settled by the pioneers and Mormon pioneers in 1847, there is a problem of actually getting this water to upper elevations. christopher flavelle So when I was in Salt Lake City, I spent time with a woman named Laura Briefer, who is the official who is in charge of the Department that runs that city’s drinking water supply. laura briefer And so the topography wasn’t suitable. But then the water — christopher flavelle And one of the main points she made was at some fundamental level, the question of water is not a new problem in Salt Lake City. This is a city built in the desert. It’s always had to worry about its water. laura briefer And so the waters that were more pristine and also could be gravity fed to a culinary drinking water system were tapped. And those were these mountain streams. christopher flavelle OK, OK, so these, so these —

sabrina tavernise

So from its earliest days, it sounds like the city has been diverting water from the lake. I mean, I guess it seemed reasonable in the 19th century. But it turned out to be pretty bad environmental hygiene.

christopher flavelle

Yes. The thing to remember is for a long time, this made sense. And the things that have changed are relatively new, the huge population growth and the pressure on that system from droughts and heat. So it turns out there’s an upper limit on how many households and businesses you can safely supply water to in Salt Lake City if you don’t want the lake to disappear. And Laura Briefer drove me around to help me understand how their water system works.

christopher flavelle And so the other source, the reservoir, feeds directly into the plant? Or it’s — laura briefer Mhm. christopher flavelle OK, that sounds nice.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so Laura Briefer’s agency, the city utility agency, is the government body that keeps an eye on this issue. But how closely are they following it?

christopher flavelle

Well, they’re following it very closely. And, in fact, they prepare crisis management documents regarding water usage and availability that looks forward decades.

christopher flavelle Right. And running out of water in this context means that your main supply goes dry and then your reservoir goes dry? Or does it just — maybe the meaning is more simple, and just don’t have the daily supply to meet your daily demand? laura briefer It’s daily supply meaning daily demand. christopher flavelle What do your office’s protocols call for? What would your first step be if demand exceeded supply one day?

christopher flavelle

And they have different stages indicating how bad the situation is and what to do about it.

laura briefer So we have a water shortage contingency plan. And there are five stages of action to be taken.

christopher flavelle

And those stages go from stage one, which is a minor shortage, where they advise voluntary reductions in water use, all the way to stage five, which is the most critical stage.

christopher flavelle And you hit the second stage last year? laura briefer We hit the second stage last year, which is a precautionary, very proactive stage.

sabrina tavernise

Stage two out of five, but what does that mean?

christopher flavelle

So stage two is when you move past strictly voluntary limits and you start to impose mandatory limits on some of the bigger water uses, but not yet on households. So it’s creeping into the territory of telling people how much water they can use.

laura briefer I would never want to be in a situation where we ran out of water. christopher flavelle Right, and I assume all those stages are designed to prevent that from happening. So if you hit stage five, does that mean that your demand has outstripped supply? Or it’s the last step that you have to prevent that from happening? laura briefer It’s the last step we have. And in that stage, we ration water. Outdoor irrigation is very, very limited. There are mandatory actions that the community has to take. And they’re regulated.

christopher flavelle

So at stage five, not only is the city actively policing individual water use, but it also has to go out and try and find ways to bring water in from nearby communities because it can no longer meet its own needs.

christopher flavelle But what happens if you actually have demand that exceeds supply and you’ve gone through five stages? laura briefer Yeah, we’ve never been there. But for us, we have some interconnected systems with Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District and Central Utah Project. christopher flavelle So you could draw from neighbors? laura briefer We could potentially draw from neighbors.

christopher flavelle

One problem with that staging plan is Salt Lake City and the surrounding cities and counties ultimately share the same source of water. So if one place runs out, chances are good that the surrounding areas could be running out, too.

christopher flavelle I hate to be Debbie Downer — laura briefer But what if the whole state — christopher flavelle — but it seems like since it’s all one watershed, it’s at least plausible that if you ran out of water your neighbors would as well? laura briefer Hopefully it doesn’t happen that abruptly. So hopefully we see it coming. christopher flavelle Yeah. How many —

christopher flavelle

So officials hope that they’ll have time to prepare. But the underlying problem is population growth. And the population is growing now. And from my reporting and talking to local and state officials, it didn’t seem like there was any appetite to do anything that would curb that growth now.

christopher flavelle I read the State Water Plan that came out in December on my flight in. One of the things that striked me was it seemed to accept as given the premise that the population in the state will double by 2060. Not that I’m taking a stance on the wisdom of that, but I thought that seems not to be fixed, right? And it seems like of the universe of potential options, I would have thought that one option might be, well, maybe the state shouldn’t grow as much. If the question is, how do you find new water supplies for a doubled population, maybe the answer is don’t double your population. Do you feel that your office has the pull to say to the development people, you know, guys, rather than just ask us to find more water, maybe we can ask you to grow less? laura briefer Yeah, I don’t feel like that is a conversation that happens between water managers and developers very often.

sabrina tavernise

But I’m curious, Chris, can someone like Laura Briefer just go to the city and tell them we need to stop growing or we’re not going to sustain this?

christopher flavelle

So the authority is there in theory.

christopher flavelle But if I want to densify a given plot, do I have to get a permit from your office? laura briefer You do, yes. christopher flavelle And do you use that authority? laura briefer No, not very often. christopher flavelle I would think that would seem like a real buzzkill politically.

christopher flavelle

But the issue, unsurprisingly, is the politics aren’t that great.

laura briefer And, of course, there’s always politics involved. So there’s a balance that we try to maintain. christopher flavelle But, Laura —

christopher flavelle

The impression I got from speaking with Laura Briefer was that she doesn’t see it as her job to regulate or affect the rate of growth. And probably others don’t see it as her job either, either at the state or local level. Those are higher decisions that really, really belong to elected officials.

sabrina tavernise

So this is a really hard problem. And it’s the reason we’re stuck in a lot of the country in terms of dealing with climate change. I mean, most places are looking to grow. It’s equated with progress, right? And a city like Salt Lake City doesn’t want to pump the brakes on that, even if the lake is going to dry up, because it would mean saying no to something that everybody wants to say yes to, growth.

christopher flavelle

That’s exactly right. And it’s not just that we want to say yes to growth. We want to say yes to low-cost growth, right? I think elected officials don’t want to impose costs on their constituents. And they also don’t want to say anything about limiting their constituents’ choices for how they live. So if you got a lawn and you want to water that lawn, nobody wants to tell you not to water that lawn. No one wants to tell you where you can or cannot live. I think there’s a mentality in this country that we don’t want to impose sacrifice on Americans. And unfortunately, a lot of adapting to climate change really means imposing some degree of sacrifice, some narrowing of the choices that they have. And what’s so revealing about this case is Salt Lake City is reluctant to impose meaningful change or meaningful sacrifice on its residents, even knowing that the cost of inaction could mean poisoning the air and losing their water. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

So, Chris, if you had to guess and look into your crystal ball, what do you think the chances are that the Great Salt Lake will dry up Entirely

christopher flavelle

[LAUGHS]: I think that’s the right question. And it’s the same question that I posed to state and local officials when I was in Utah. And they all told me that they think they’ll find a way. There’s so much that Utah could do. There’s so much that Salt Lake City could do. They could impose higher costs on water users per gallon and that way get people to do less of the activities that consume lots of water, like watering their lawns. They could become a little more aggressive about when they approve and when they deny permits for more construction. They could be up front with people about the cost of growing and using water. So there’s a lot that could happen. It’s not like it’s some binary on/off switch, where either they go with the flow or they become environmental radicals, right? And so I wouldn’t want people to come away from this with the impression that the only salvation for Salt Lake City is doing the unthinkable and slamming the brakes on growth. You could do a lot in the meantime. And it’s just not clear to me that even those intermediate fixes are underway, because again, they’re not popular. And that just seems to me the most shocking takeaway from all of this.

sabrina tavernise

And, Chris, on that note, in the pretty plausible scenario that they don’t act fast enough and this dire future you’ve been describing really does happen, what would life in Salt Lake City look like?

christopher flavelle

I mean, after the story ran, some people joked to me that this is going to be great news for people who make gas masks that filter arsenic out of the air. And at some level, you could imagine a world where if everything else fails, living in Salt Lake City becomes an exercise in just expecting the worst, having a gas mask on you in case there’s a dust storm, and just accepting it as the cost of living there. The air is bad, but people just get used to it. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

So, Chris, I wonder how we should be thinking about this problem in terms of the rest of the country. I mean, here you have a city that’s about to experience this slow-motion car crash, right? In some sense it’s already started. And the consequences are understood. They’re not disputed. And there are clear solutions. But they are politically and economically very costly. So I guess my question for you is, do you think that that is the basic approach we’ll see across the United States more broadly, that we will likely not try to stop the problem from happening, but put all of our resources into making the problem less bad once it does happen, for better or for worse?

christopher flavelle

So in one sense, the Great Salt Lake saga is about human nature and how the incentives point towards inaction, even in the face of catastrophe. But the glass-half-full take on what’s happening in Utah might be that other cities could look at this and think, well, we don’t want to be like them. So maybe the lesson here is anticipate these problems. They tend not to come out of nowhere. And start a conversation early with your residents and your voters about what the local climate crisis is going to look like. And try to figure out some kind of consensus about what people are willing to give up to head off that crisis. I think many cities will look at Utah and say, thank god we don’t face those kinds of problems. But the reality is almost everywhere in the United States faces some version, some variety of this kind of challenge. And the question for all of them is going to be, will you wait as long as Utah did or will you act faster?

sabrina tavernise

Chris, thank you.

christopher flavelle

Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

Instead, they said Trump watched the attack unfold on TV, even as Secret Service agents protecting Vice President Pence at the Capitol became so fearful for their lives that they used their radios to say goodbye to their families. Never-before-seen video revealed that when Trump finally did call for rioters to go home in January 6, he ignored the carefully worded script approved by his aides and instead sympathized with the rioters and improvised remarks. And then in a speech the next day he refused, to say that the election was over.

archived recording (donald trump) I’ll do this. I’m going to do this. Let’s go. But this election is now over. Congress has certified the results. I don’t want to say the election’s over. I just want to say Congress has certified the results without saying the election’s over, OK?

1733,2021-09-10,Dry weather and high winds raise the risk of new fires in Northern California.,"About 100 miles east of Sacramento, the Caldor fire remained a threat, having consumed about 219,000 acres while being only 53 percent contained, according to a New York Times wildfire tracker. The cause of that blaze, which started almost a month ago, remains under investigation.

Thousands of residents have been forced to flee, and more than 780 homes have been destroyed since the blaze started. Late last month, officials said the Caldor fire had become the state’s top priority.

Farther north, where a red flag warning was also in place, the expanding Dixie fire prompted more evacuations on Thursday, when the fire jumped Highway 44 and reached just outside of Old Station, a small town in Shasta County.

The Dixie fire, now the second largest in state history, has burned more than 950,000 acres in two months and is 59 percent contained. More than 720 homes have been destroyed.

1734,2020-09-15,How Climate Migration Will Reshape America,"August besieged California with a heat unseen in generations. A surge in air-conditioning broke the state’s electrical grid, leaving a population already ravaged by the coronavirus to work remotely by the dim light of their cellphones. By midmonth, the state had recorded possibly the hottest temperature ever measured on earth — 130 degrees in Death Valley — and an otherworldly storm of lightning had cracked open the sky. From Santa Cruz to Lake Tahoe, thousands of bolts of electricity exploded down onto withered grasslands and forests, some of them already hollowed out by climate-driven infestations of beetles and kiln-dried by the worst five-year drought on record. Soon, California was on fire.

This article, the second in a series on global climate migration, is a partnership between ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine, with support from the Pulitzer Center. Read Part 1 and Part 3.

Over the next two weeks, 900 blazes incinerated six times as much land as all the state’s 2019 wildfires combined, forcing 100,000 people from their homes. Three of the largest fires in history burned simultaneously in a ring around the San Francisco Bay Area. Another fire burned just 12 miles from my home in Marin County. I watched as towering plumes of smoke billowed from distant hills in all directions and air tankers crisscrossed the skies. Like many Californians, I spent those weeks worrying about what might happen next, wondering how long it would be before an inferno of 60-foot flames swept up the steep, grassy hillside on its way toward my own house, rehearsing in my mind what my family would do to escape.

But I also had a longer-term question, about what would happen once this unprecedented fire season ended. Was it finally time to leave for good?

I had an unusual perspective on the matter. For two years, I have been studying how climate change will influence global migration. My sense was that of all the devastating consequences of a warming planet — changing landscapes, pandemics, mass extinctions — the potential movement of hundreds of millions of climate refugees across the planet stands to be among the most important. I traveled across four countries to witness how rising temperatures were driving climate refugees away from some of the poorest and hottest parts of the world. I had also helped create an enormous computer simulation to analyze how global demographics might shift, and now I was working on a data-mapping project about migration here in the United States.

So it was with some sense of recognition that I faced the fires these last few weeks. In recent years, summer has brought a season of fear to California, with ever-worsening wildfires closing in. But this year felt different. The hopelessness of the pattern was now clear, and the pandemic had already uprooted so many Americans. Relocation no longer seemed like such a distant prospect. Like the subjects of my reporting, climate change had found me, its indiscriminate forces erasing all semblance of normalcy. Suddenly I had to ask myself the very question I’d been asking others: Was it time to move?

I am far from the only American facing such questions. This summer has seen more fires, more heat, more storms — all of it making life increasingly untenable in larger areas of the nation. Already, droughts regularly threaten food crops across the West, while destructive floods inundate towns and fields from the Dakotas to Maryland, collapsing dams in Michigan and raising the shorelines of the Great Lakes. Rising seas and increasingly violent hurricanes are making thousands of miles of American shoreline nearly uninhabitable. As California burned, Hurricane Laura pounded the Louisiana coast with 150-mile-an-hour winds, killing at least 25 people; it was the 12th named storm to form by that point in 2020, another record. Phoenix, meanwhile, endured 53 days of 110-degree heat — 20 more days than the previous record.

For years, Americans have avoided confronting these changes in their own backyards. The decisions we make about where to live are distorted not just by politics that play down climate risks, but also by expensive subsidies and incentives aimed at defying nature. In much of the developing world, vulnerable people will attempt to flee the emerging perils of global warming, seeking cooler temperatures, more fresh water and safety. But here in the United States, people have largely gravitated toward environmental danger, building along coastlines from New Jersey to Florida and settling across the cloudless deserts of the Southwest.

I wanted to know if this was beginning to change. Might Americans finally be waking up to how climate is about to transform their lives? And if so — if a great domestic relocation might be in the offing — was it possible to project where we might go? To answer these questions, I interviewed more than four dozen experts: economists and demographers, climate scientists and insurance executives, architects and urban planners, and I mapped out the danger zones that will close in on Americans over the next 30 years. The maps for the first time combined exclusive climate data from the Rhodium Group, an independent data-analytics firm; wildfire projections modeled by United States Forest Service researchers and others; and data about America’s shifting climate niches, an evolution of work first published by The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last spring. (See a detailed analysis of the maps.)

What I found was a nation on the cusp of a great transformation. Across the United States, some 162 million people — nearly one in two — will most likely experience a decline in the quality of their environment, namely more heat and less water. For 93 million of them, the changes could be particularly severe, and by 2070, our analysis suggests, if carbon emissions rise at extreme levels, at least four million Americans could find themselves living at the fringe, in places decidedly outside the ideal niche for human life. The cost of resisting the new climate reality is mounting. Florida officials have already acknowledged that defending some roadways against the sea will be unaffordable. And the nation’s federal flood-insurance program is for the first time requiring that some of its payouts be used to retreat from climate threats across the country. It will soon prove too expensive to maintain the status quo.

By 2070, some 28 million people across the country could face Manhattan-size megafires. In Northern California, they could become an annual event. A megafire on average every … 1-2 years

Then what? One influential 2018 study, published in The Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, suggests that one in 12 Americans in the Southern half of the country will move toward California, the Mountain West or the Northwest over the next 45 years because of climate influences alone. Such a shift in population is likely to increase poverty and widen the gulf between the rich and the poor. It will accelerate rapid, perhaps chaotic, urbanization of cities ill-equipped for the burden, testing their capacity to provide basic services and amplifying existing inequities. It will eat away at prosperity, dealing repeated economic blows to coastal, rural and Southern regions, which could in turn push entire communities to the brink of collapse. This process has already begun in rural Louisiana and coastal Georgia, where low-income and Black and Indigenous communities face environmental change on top of poor health and extreme poverty. Mobility itself, global-migration experts point out, is often a reflection of relative wealth, and as some move, many others will be left behind. Those who stay risk becoming trapped as the land and the society around them ceases to offer any more support.

There are signs that the message is breaking through. Half of Americans now rank climate as a top political priority, up from roughly one-third in 2016, and three out of four now describe climate change as either “a crisis” or “a major problem.” This year, Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa, where tens of thousands of acres of farmland flooded in 2019, ranked climate second only to health care as an issue. A poll by researchers at Yale and George Mason Universities found that even Republicans’ views are shifting: One in three now think climate change should be declared a national emergency.

Policymakers, having left America unprepared for what’s next, now face brutal choices about which communities to save — often at exorbitant costs — and which to sacrifice. Their decisions will almost inevitably make the nation more divided, with those worst off relegated to a nightmare future in which they are left to fend for themselves. Nor will these disruptions wait for the worst environmental changes to occur. The wave begins when individual perception of risk starts to shift, when the environmental threat reaches past the least fortunate and rattles the physical and financial security of broader, wealthier parts of the population. It begins when even places like California’s suburbs are no longer safe.

It has already begun.

Let’s start with some basics. Across the country, it’s going to get hot. Buffalo may feel in a few decades like Tempe, Ariz., does today, and Tempe itself will sustain 100-degree average summer temperatures by the end of the century. Extreme humidity from New Orleans to northern Wisconsin will make summers increasingly unbearable, turning otherwise seemingly survivable heat waves into debilitating health threats. Fresh water will also be in short supply, not only in the West but also in places like Florida, Georgia and Alabama, where droughts now regularly wither cotton fields. By 2040, according to federal government projections, extreme water shortages will be nearly ubiquitous west of Missouri. The Memphis Sands Aquifer, a crucial water supply for Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas and Louisiana, is already overdrawn by hundreds of millions of gallons a day. Much of the Ogallala Aquifer — which supplies nearly a third of the nation’s irrigation groundwater — could be gone by the end of the century.

It can be difficult to see the challenges clearly because so many factors are in play. At least 28 million Americans are likely to face megafires like the ones we are now seeing in California, in places like Texas and Florida and Georgia. At the same time, 100 million Americans — largely in the Mississippi River Basin from Louisiana to Wisconsin — will increasingly face humidity so extreme that working outside or playing school sports could cause heatstroke. Crop yields will be decimated from Texas to Alabama and all the way north through Oklahoma and Kansas and into Nebraska.

The challenges are so widespread and so interrelated that Americans seeking to flee one could well run into another. I live on a hilltop, 400 feet above sea level, and my home will never be touched by rising waters. But by the end of this century, if the more extreme projections of eight to 10 feet of sea-level rise come to fruition, the shoreline of San Francisco Bay will move three miles closer to my house, as it subsumes some 166 square miles of land, including a high school, a new county hospital and the store where I buy groceries. The freeway to San Francisco will need to be raised, and to the east, a new bridge will be required to connect the community of Point Richmond to the city of Berkeley. The Latino, Asian and Black communities who live in the most-vulnerable low-lying districts will be displaced first, but research from Mathew Hauer, a sociologist at Florida State University who published some of the first modeling of American climate migration in the journal Nature Climate Change in 2017, suggests that the toll will eventually be far more widespread: Nearly one in three people here in Marin County will leave, part of the roughly 700,000 who his models suggest may abandon the broader Bay Area as a result of sea-level rise alone.

From Maine to North Carolina to Texas, rising sea levels are not just chewing up shorelines but also raising rivers and swamping the subterranean infrastructure of coastal communities, making a stable life there all but impossible. Coastal high points will be cut off from roadways, amenities and escape routes, and even far inland, saltwater will seep into underground drinking-water supplies. Eight of the nation’s 20 largest metropolitan areas — Miami, New York and Boston among them — will be profoundly altered, indirectly affecting some 50 million people. Imagine large concrete walls separating Fort Lauderdale condominiums from a beachless waterfront, or dozens of new bridges connecting the islands of Philadelphia. Not every city can spend $100 billion on a sea wall, as New York most likely will. Barrier islands? Rural areas along the coast without a strong tax base? They are likely, in the long term, unsalvageable.

In all, Hauer projects that 13 million Americans will be forced to move away from submerged coastlines. Add to that the people contending with wildfires and other risks, and the number of Americans who might move — though difficult to predict precisely — could easily be tens of millions larger. Even 13 million climate migrants, though, would rank as the largest migration in North American history. The Great Migration — of six million Black Americans out of the South from 1916 to 1970 — transformed almost everything we know about America, from the fate of its labor movement to the shape of its cities to the sound of its music. What would it look like when twice that many people moved? What might change?

COOLIDGE, ARIZ. Marisela Felix set up a pool to keep her daughters and niece cool during 108-degree heat.

Americans have been conditioned not to respond to geographical climate threats as people in the rest of the world do. It is natural that rural Guatemalans or subsistence farmers in Kenya, facing drought or scorching heat, would seek out someplace more stable and resilient. Even a subtle environmental change — a dry well, say — can mean life or death, and without money to address the problem, migration is often simply a question of survival.

By comparison, Americans are richer, often much richer, and more insulated from the shocks of climate change. They are distanced from the food and water sources they depend on, and they are part of a culture that sees every problem as capable of being solved by money. So even as the average flow of the Colorado River — the water supply for 40 million Western Americans and the backbone of the nation’s vegetable and cattle farming — has declined for most of the last 33 years, the population of Nevada has doubled. At the same time, more than 1.5 million people have moved to the Phoenix metro area, despite its dependence on that same river (and the fact that temperatures there now regularly hit 115 degrees). Since Hurricane Andrew devastated Florida in 1992 — and even as that state has become a global example of the threat of sea-level rise — more than five million people have moved to Florida’s shorelines, driving a historic boom in building and real estate.

Sea-level rise could displace as many as 13 million coastal residents by 2060, including 290,000 people in North Carolina. Percent of properties below high tide … 5–25%

Similar patterns are evident across the country. Census data show us how Americans move: toward heat, toward coastlines, toward drought, regardless of evidence of increasing storms and flooding and other disasters.

The sense that money and technology can overcome nature has emboldened Americans. Where money and technology fail, though, it inevitably falls to government policies — and government subsidies — to pick up the slack. Thanks to federally subsidized canals, for example, water in part of the Desert Southwest costs less than it does in Philadelphia. The federal National Flood Insurance Program has paid to rebuild houses that have flooded six times over in the same spot. And federal agriculture aid withholds subsidies from farmers who switch to drought-resistant crops, while paying growers to replant the same ones that failed. Farmers, seed manufacturers, real estate developers and a few homeowners benefit, at least momentarily, but the gap between what the climate can destroy and what money can replace is growing.

Perhaps no market force has proved more influential — and more misguided — than the nation’s property-insurance system. From state to state, readily available and affordable policies have made it attractive to buy or replace homes even where they are at high risk of disasters, systematically obscuring the reality of the climate threat and fooling many Americans into thinking that their decisions are safer than they actually are. Part of the problem is that most policies look only 12 months into the future, ignoring long-term trends even as insurance availability influences development and drives people’s long-term decision-making.

Even where insurers have tried to withdraw policies or raise rates to reduce climate-related liabilities, state regulators have forced them to provide affordable coverage anyway, simply subsidizing the cost of underwriting such a risky policy or, in some cases, offering it themselves. The regulations — called Fair Access to Insurance Requirements — are justified by developers and local politicians alike as economic lifeboats “of last resort” in regions where climate change threatens to interrupt economic growth. While they do protect some entrenched and vulnerable communities, the laws also satisfy the demand of wealthier homeowners who still want to be able to buy insurance.

LAKE CHARLES, LA. Cassidy Plaisance surveying what was left of her friend’s home after Hurricane Laura.

At least 30 states, including Louisiana, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Texas, have developed so-called FAIR plans, and today they serve as a market backstop in the places facing the highest risks of climate-driven disasters, including coastal flooding, hurricanes and wildfires.

In an era of climate change, though, such policies amount to a sort of shell game, meant to keep growth going even when other obvious signs and scientific research suggest that it should stop.

That’s what happened in Florida. Hurricane Andrew reduced parts of cities to landfill and cost insurers nearly $16 billion in payouts. Many insurance companies, recognizing the likelihood that it would happen again, declined to renew policies and left the state. So the Florida Legislature created a state-run company to insure properties itself, preventing both an exodus and an economic collapse by essentially pretending that the climate vulnerabilities didn’t exist.

As a result, Florida’s taxpayers by 2012 had assumed liabilities worth some $511 billion — more than seven times the state’s total budget — as the value of coastal property topped $2.8 trillion. Another direct hurricane risked bankrupting the state. Florida, concerned that it had taken on too much risk, has since scaled back its self-insurance plan. But the development that resulted is still in place.

On a sweltering afternoon last October, with the skies above me full of wildfire smoke, I called Jesse Keenan, an urban-planning and climate-change specialist then at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design, who advises the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission on market hazards from climate change. Keenan, who is now an associate professor of real estate at Tulane University’s School of Architecture, had been in the news last year for projecting where people might move to — suggesting that Duluth, Minn., for instance, should brace for a coming real estate boom as climate migrants move north. But like other scientists I’d spoken with, Keenan had been reluctant to draw conclusions about where these migrants would be driven from.

Last fall, though, as the previous round of fires ravaged California, his phone began to ring, with private-equity investors and bankers all looking for his read on the state’s future. Their interest suggested a growing investor-grade nervousness about swiftly mounting environmental risk in the hottest real estate markets in the country. It’s an early sign, he told me, that the momentum is about to switch directions. “And once this flips,” he added, “it’s likely to flip very quickly.”

In fact, the correction — a newfound respect for the destructive power of nature, coupled with a sudden disavowal of Americans’ appetite for reckless development — had begun two years earlier, when a frightening surge in disasters offered a jolting preview of how the climate crisis was changing the rules.

On October 9, 2017, a wildfire blazed through the suburban blue-collar neighborhood of Coffey Park in Santa Rosa, Calif., virtually in my own backyard. I awoke to learn that more than 1,800 buildings were reduced to ashes, less than 35 miles from where I slept. Inchlong cinders had piled on my windowsills like falling snow.

The Tubbs Fire, as it was called, shouldn’t have been possible. Coffey Park is surrounded not by vegetation but by concrete and malls and freeways. So insurers had rated it as “basically zero risk,” according to Kevin Van Leer, then a risk modeler from the global insurance liability firm Risk Management Solutions. (He now does similar work for Cape Analytics.) But Van Leer, who had spent seven years picking through the debris left by disasters to understand how insurers could anticipate — and price — the risk of their happening again, had begun to see other “impossible” fires. After a 2016 fire tornado ripped through northern Canada and a firestorm consumed Gatlinburg, Tenn., he said, “alarm bells started going off” for the insurance industry.

What Van Leer saw when he walked through Coffey Park a week after the Tubbs Fire changed the way he would model and project fire risk forever. Typically, fire would spread along the ground, burning maybe 50 percent of structures. In Santa Rosa, more than 90 percent had been leveled. “The destruction was complete,” he told me. Van Leer determined that the fire had jumped through the forest canopy, spawning 70-mile-per-hour winds that kicked a storm of embers into the modest homes of Coffey Park, which burned at an acre a second as homes ignited spontaneously from the radiant heat. It was the kind of thing that might never have been possible if California’s autumn winds weren’t getting fiercer and drier every year, colliding with intensifying, climate-driven heat and ever-expanding development. “It’s hard to forecast something you’ve never seen before,” he said.

For me, the awakening to imminent climate risk came with California’s rolling power blackouts last fall — an effort to pre-emptively avoid the risk of a live wire sparking a fire — which showed me that all my notional perspective about climate risk and my own life choices were on a collision course. After the first one, all the food in our refrigerator was lost. When power was interrupted six more times in three weeks, we stopped trying to keep it stocked. All around us, small fires burned. Thick smoke produced fits of coughing. Then, as now, I packed an ax and a go-bag in my car, ready to evacuate. As former Gov. Jerry Brown said, it was beginning to feel like the “new abnormal.”

It was no surprise, then, that California’s property insurers — having watched 26 years’ worth of profits dissolve over 24 months — began dropping policies, or that California’s insurance commissioner, trying to slow the slide, placed a moratorium on insurance cancellations for parts of the state in 2020. In February, the Legislature introduced a bill compelling California to, in the words of one consumer advocacy group, “follow the lead of Florida” by mandating that insurance remain available, in this case with a requirement that homeowners first harden their properties against fire. At the same time, participation in California’s FAIR plan for catastrophic fires has grown by at least 180 percent since 2015, and in Santa Rosa, houses are being rebuilt in the very same wildfire-vulnerable zones that proved so deadly in 2017. Given that a new study projects a 20 percent increase in extreme-fire-weather days by 2035, such practices suggest a special form of climate negligence.

It’s only a matter of time before homeowners begin to recognize the unsustainability of this approach. Market shock, when driven by the sort of cultural awakening to risk that Keenan observes, can strike a neighborhood like an infectious disease, with fear spreading doubt — and devaluation — from door to door. It happened that way in the foreclosure crisis.

By 2060 in Florida and elsewhere, the costs of sea-level rise and hurricanes will be compounded by knock-on economic challenges, from growing crime to falling productivity. Economic damages as a proportion of G.D.P. … 10%–55%

Keenan calls the practice of drawing arbitrary lending boundaries around areas of perceived environmental risk “bluelining,” and indeed many of the neighborhoods that banks are bluelining are the same as the ones that were hit by the racist redlining practice in days past. This summer, climate-data analysts at the First Street Foundation released maps showing that 70 percent more buildings in the United States were vulnerable to flood risk than previously thought; most of the underestimated risk was in low-income neighborhoods.

Such neighborhoods see little in the way of flood-prevention investment. My Bay Area neighborhood, on the other hand, has benefited from consistent investment in efforts to defend it against the ravages of climate change. That questions of livability had reached me, here, were testament to Keenan’s belief that the bluelining phenomenon will eventually affect large majorities of equity-holding middle-class Americans too, with broad implications for the overall economy, starting in the nation’s largest state.

Under the radar, a new class of dangerous debt — climate-distressed mortgage loans — might already be threatening the financial system. Lending data analyzed by Keenan and his co-author, Jacob Bradt, for a study published in the journal Climatic Change in June shows that small banks are liberally making loans on environmentally threatened homes, but then quickly passing them along to federal mortgage backers. At the same time, they have all but stopped lending money for the higher-end properties worth too much for the government to accept, suggesting that the banks are knowingly passing climate liabilities along to taxpayers as stranded assets.

Once home values begin a one-way plummet, it’s easy for economists to see how entire communities spin out of control. The tax base declines and the school system and civic services falter, creating a negative feedback loop that pushes more people to leave. Rising insurance costs and the perception of risk force credit-rating agencies to downgrade towns, making it more difficult for them to issue bonds and plug the springing financial leaks. Local banks, meanwhile, keep securitizing their mortgage debt, sloughing off their own liabilities.

Keenan, though, had a bigger point: All the structural disincentives that had built Americans’ irrational response to the climate risk were now reaching their logical endpoint. A pandemic-induced economic collapse will only heighten the vulnerabilities and speed the transition, reducing to nothing whatever thin margin of financial protection has kept people in place. Until now, the market mechanisms had essentially socialized the consequences of high-risk development. But as the costs rise — and the insurers quit, and the bankers divest, and the farm subsidies prove too wasteful, and so on — the full weight of responsibility will fall on individual people.

And that’s when the real migration might begin.

As I spoke with Keenan last year, I looked out my own kitchen window onto hillsides of parkland, singed brown by months of dry summer heat. This was precisely the land that my utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, had three times identified as such an imperiled tinderbox that it had to shut off power to avoid fire. It was precisely the kind of wildland-urban interface that all the studies I read blamed for heightening Californians’ exposure to climate risks. I mentioned this on the phone and then asked Keenan, “Should I be selling my house and getting — ”

He cut me off: “Yes.”

Americans have dealt with climate disaster before. The Dust Bowl started after the federal government expanded the Homestead Act to offer more land to settlers willing to work the marginal soil of the Great Plains. Millions took up the invitation, replacing hardy prairie grass with thirsty crops like corn, wheat and cotton. Then, entirely predictably, came the drought. From 1929 to 1934, crop yields across Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri plunged by 60 percent, leaving farmers destitute and exposing the now-barren topsoil to dry winds and soaring temperatures. The resulting dust storms, some of them taller than skyscrapers, buried homes whole and blew as far east as Washington. The disaster propelled an exodus of some 2.5 million people, mostly to the West, where newcomers — “Okies” not just from Oklahoma but also Texas, Arkansas and Missouri — unsettled communities and competed for jobs. Colorado tried to seal its border from the climate refugees; in California, they were funneled into squalid shanty towns. Only after the migrants settled and had years to claw back a decent life did some towns bounce back stronger.

The places migrants left behind never fully recovered. Eighty years later, Dust Bowl towns still have slower economic growth and lower per capita income than the rest of the country. Dust Bowl survivors and their children are less likely to go to college and more likely to live in poverty. Climatic change made them poor, and it has kept them poor ever since.

A Dust Bowl event will most likely happen again. The Great Plains states today provide nearly half of the nation’s wheat, sorghum and cattle and much of its corn; the farmers and ranchers there export that food to Africa, South America and Asia. Crop yields, though, will drop sharply with every degree of warming. By 2050, researchers at the University of Chicago and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies found, Dust Bowl-era yields will be the norm, even as demand for scarce water jumps by as much as 20 percent. Another extreme drought would drive near-total crop losses worse than the Dust Bowl, kneecapping the broader economy. At that point, the authors write, “abandonment is one option.”

Corn and soy production will decrease with every degree of warming. By 2060, parts of Texas may experience a drop in yields of more than 92 percent. Crop yield decline by: 60–92%

Projections are inherently imprecise, but the gradual changes to America’s cropland — plus the steady baking and burning and flooding — suggest that we are already witnessing a slower-forming but much larger replay of the Dust Bowl that will destroy more than just crops. In 2017, Solomon Hsiang, a climate economist at the University of California, Berkeley, led an analysis of the economic impact of climate-driven changes like rising mortality and rising energy costs, finding that the poorest counties in the United States — mostly across the",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,2,1,1,-0.9998,"['Canada', 'Kenya', 'Georgia', 'United States', 'Jersey']","['Buffalo', 'Boston', 'Washington', 'Colorado', 'Oklahoma', 'Miami', 'Iowa', 'Fort Lauderdale', 'Leer', 'Berkeley', 'Maryland', 'Missouri', 'New Orleans', 'Much', 'Bay', 'Florida', 'New York', 'Philadelphia', 'Michigan', 'Asia', 'Chicago', 'Santa Rosa', 'San Francisco', 'Kansas', 'Tempe', 'Texas', 'Phoenix', 'Duluth']"

1736,2023-05-23,What the Colorado River Deal Means for California,"“The charitable account is that water negotiations are complicated, and states needed time to reach an agreement they could live with,” said my colleague Christopher Flavelle, who reported on the deal. “It’s also possible that states were unable or unwilling to commit to significant reductions in water use until they feared the federal government might otherwise impose cuts on them — a point that was fast approaching.”

Under the new agreement, most of the reductions would be made by water districts, farm operators, cities and Native American tribes in California, Nevada and Arizona, which would take less water from the river in exchange for $1.2 billion in federal grants. The three states, which receive their share of the river’s water from Lake Mead, the reservoir formed by the Hoover Dam, also agreed to make additional cuts that were not tied to payments.

Overall, the reductions called for in the deal would save about three million acre-feet of water from now through 2026 — enough to supply six million to nine million households for a year. The deal still has to be approved by the federal government, and it remains unclear how the cuts would be shared among the states.

California has typically received the largest allocation of water from the river, and we don’t yet know how the pain will be spread among residential and agricultural areas in the state. Southern California is immensely reliant on the Colorado River, which supplies irrigation water for Imperial County and drinking water for Los Angeles, San Diego and other cities.

California is in a relatively good position this year to absorb cuts, because our extremely wet winter left behind an unusually large snowpack in the mountains.

1737,2022-08-01,Why Does the American West Have So Many Wildfires?,"In just one weekend, the McKinney Fire, fueled by strong winds and high temperatures, burned more than 55,000 acres in Northern California, becoming the state’s largest wildfire so far this year. The blaze is only the beginning of the West’s fire season, which traditionally peaks between mid-July and October.

All fires need fuel and a spark. In the West, fuel is plenty, with flammable pine needles, shrubs and grasses that can ignite easily. And while the region’s dry vegetation has always made it prone to fires, climate change is intensifying wildfires and lengthening fire season.

There’s not necessarily an increase in the number of fires in the West, “but the fires are bigger, more severe, and last longer so the total area burned per year is rapidly increasing,” said Morgan Tingley, an ecologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the effects of wildfire on Western ecosystems.

Why does the West have so many catastrophic wildfires? There are four key factors.

Climate and landscape

The Western United States has what’s called a Mediterranean climate, which means that most of its rain comes during the winter months, which are wet and cool. It also means that summer, the region’s driest season, aligns with its hottest, creating suitable conditions for a fire.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.4085,['United States'],"['McKinney', 'Los Angeles']"

It is a familiar refrain to anyone who works on climate change, and it is why global efforts to slow down warming offer a cautionary tale for the effort to slow down the pandemic.

“Both demand early aggressive action to minimize loss,” said Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was teaching classes remotely this week. “Only in hindsight will we really understand what we gambled on and what we lost by not acting early enough.”

Scientists like Dr. Cobb have, for years, urged world leaders to bend the curve of planet-warming emissions. Instead, emissions have raced upward.

1739,2023-04-18,My Continent Is Not Your Giant Climate Laboratory,"Several environmentalists last year presented Africa’s leading climate negotiators with a bold idea: A technology called solar geoengineering could protect their countries from the worst effects of climate change, they said. While insisting they were impartial, representatives from the Carnegie Climate Governance Initiative said that these technologies, which claim to be able to re-engineer the climate itself, either by dimming the sun’s rays or reflecting sunlight away from the earth, could quickly and cheaply turn the tide of dangerously rising temperatures — and that poor countries might have the most to gain.

It wasn’t the first time Westerners have tried to persuade Africans that solar engineering projects may be in our best interest. And it won’t be the last. In May, another international nonprofit, the Climate Overshoot Commission, headquartered in Paris, is hosting an event in Nairobi to help drum up support for research on solar geoengineering and other related technologies it says could be helpful in reducing risks when the world exceeds its global warming targets.

As a climate expert, I consider these environmental manipulation techniques extremely risky. And as an African climate expert, I strongly object to the idea that Africa should be turned into a testing ground for their use. Even if solar geoengineering can help deflect heat and improve weather conditions on the ground — a prospect that is unproven on any relevant scale — it’s not a long-term solution to climate change. It sends a message to the world that we can carry on over-consuming and polluting because we will be able to engineer our way out of the problem.

The solar engineering technology attracting the most attention would use balloons or aircraft to spray large quantities of aerosols — tiny particles of, for example, sulfur dioxide or engineered nanoparticles — into the stratosphere to dim the sunlight. It’s called solar radiation management and it’s highly speculative.Without using the whole earth as a laboratory, it’s impossible to know whether it would dim anything, let alone how it would affect ecosystems, people and the global climate.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,0.9395,[],"['Paris', 'Nairobi']"

But then climate change, in a few different ways, seems to also load the dice toward more fire in the future.”

People

Even if the conditions are right for a wildfire, you still need something or someone to ignite it. Sometimes the trigger is nature, like the unusual lightning strikes that set off the L.N.U. Lightning Complex fires in August, but more often than not humans are responsible, said Nina S. Oakley, a research scientist at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego.

Many deadly fires have been started by downed power lines. The 2018 Carr Fire, the state’s sixth-largest on record, started when a truck blew out its tire and its rim scraped the pavement, sending out sparks. And some are started through bad decisions, like the fire that was ignited by smoke-generating fireworks as part of a gender-reveal party east of Los Angeles.

Events like gender reveal parties can trigger a blaze, Dr. Oakley noted, but “you also have the human contribution to wildfire,” which includes the warming that has been caused by greenhouse gas emissions and the accompanying increased drying. Both contribute “to creating a situation favorable to wildfire,” she said.

“California has a lot of people and a really long dry season,” Dr. Williams said. “People are always creating possible sparks, and as the dry season wears on and stuff is drying out more and more, the chance that a spark comes off a person at the wrong time just goes up. And that’s putting aside arson.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,1,0,0,0.9175,[],"['San Diego', 'Oakley', 'Los Angeles']"

1743,2022-11-10,Remaking the River That Remade L.A.,"Canoga Park High

At 51 miles long, it’s one of America’s largest infrastructure projects. Angelenos live, work and play along it, but know little of its origins ... nor its role in protecting them from devastating flood waters. Remaking the River That Remade L.A.

February 1938 was a wet month in Los Angeles. The ground, where it hadn’t been paved over, was saturated, which meant rain had nowhere to go except into the streets, canals and washes. On the 27th, a storm arrived. During the following days, the city received its second-highest 24-hour rainfall in history. Reservoirs overflowed, dams topped out and floodwaters careered down Pacoima Wash and Tujunga Wash toward the Los Angeles River. By the time the river peaked at Long Beach, its flow exceeded the Mississippi’s at St. Louis. “It was as if the Pacific had moved in to take back its ancient bed,” wrote Rupert Hughes in “City of Angels,” a 1941 novel that climaxes with the flood. In an instant, the Lankershim Bridge in North Hollywood collapsed, and five people were swept away. Sewer and gas lines ruptured; communications were cut; houses were lifted straight off their foundations and sank into the water. In all, 87 people died.

The Los Angeles River after the 1938 flood.

The Los Angeles River was never a storybook river of the kind that, like the Hudson or the Seine, we associate with great cities. It was an arid, Janus-faced watercourse — most of the time hardly more than a shallow, burbling brook, which ran underground in places and occasionally turned bone-dry. But with heavy rains, it was prone to flooding, occasionally gaining the full, deadly force of the Mississippi or the Colorado and violently overreaching its low banks.

That violence, as the geographer Blake Gumprecht recounts in his history of the river, was due, in part, to its extreme topography. You might not think of the river’s course as steep, because it emerges in the San Fernando Valley. But over 51 miles, beginning behind the football field of a high school in Canoga Park and ending at the ocean in Long Beach, the Los Angeles River descends more than the Mississippi does over its entire 2,000-plus-mile stretch — meaning it gathers tremendous speed and power when the waters run high.

Los Angeles repeatedly tried to tame and channel the river. A massive flood in 1914 turned Long Beach into an island and increased public pressure on authorities to subjugate the waterway, which only really became possible after the completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913. A feat of engineering often compared to the construction of the Panama Canal, the aqueduct brought the Owens River on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada to the San Fernando Valley, liberating Los Angeles from dependence on its erratic river, which could then be repurposed to channel floodwaters.

That job turned out to be an equally Pharaonic effort. Requiring decades of complex construction and finally completed in the 1960s, the channel remains the largest public works project the United States Army Corps of Engineers has undertaken west of the Mississippi. It meant widening, deepening and straitjacketing the river into a dogleg and entombing it in concrete for most of its length. Where it once naturally snaked along a shallow, quixotic route, sometimes turning west, sometimes south, the new channel charted a beeline for the ocean, resembling an airport runway for long stretches, broad enough to land jumbo jets, with a sad, narrow groove carved down the middle to handle the normal trickle of water.

Protecting downtown and the city’s infrastructure from floods, the channel made possible the emergence of Los Angeles as a great, global megalopolis of booming businesses and single-family houses with green lawns and swimming pools. It solved an existential problem, but it also left a gaping scar across the region, one that exacerbated growing racial and economic tensions. The vanquished river soon became a dumping ground and frequent crime scene, much of it fenced off, crisscrossed by bridges, hemmed in by railway tracks, highways and heavy industry. Increasingly, immigrant and working-class communities, victims of redlining and other discriminatory practices, found themselves concentrated in neighborhoods wedged between the freight trains and freeways that hugged the channel and its polluted, industrialized banks.

“Erased from the city’s mental map,” as Patt Morrison, the Los Angeles Times columnist and author of “Río L.A.,” put it, the river all but disappeared from the news except when someone drowned or Hollywood used the channel to stage an invasion of giant ants in “Them!” or a drag race in “Grease” or an epic chase in “Terminator 2.” Millions of Angelenos were only too happy to forget that the river even existed.

In this year’s tech & design issue, the magazine collaborated with The Times’s Headway team to present an issue about how people around the world approach rebuilding during a time of continuous disaster.

But over time, the river has slowly come back into focus. Since 1938, Los Angeles hasn’t suffered a flood as disastrous as the one that year, thanks in no small part to the channel’s engineering, which has also allowed Angelenos to forget the danger the river originally posed. As the threat of flooding receded in people’s minds, objections to the channel — and its effects — have grown. Droughts have increasingly raised questions about the logic of a channel built to hasten billions of gallons of rainwater out of the region and into the ocean. Environmentalists, concerned about the despoliation of nature, have been lobbying for the concrete to be removed and the river rewilded, with new marshes and wetlands to green the city and mitigate flooding. And social activists have focused on how the channel worsens racial and income disparities, depriving underserved communities of healthy open spaces and concentrating poverty along the industrialized margins of the river.

Several decades after its completion, it is the flood channel itself — not the floods it was built to contain — that many Angelenos have come to see as the disaster.

In June, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved the first new master plan for the river in more than a quarter-century. Like all master plans, it lacks legislative teeth and has its share of detractors. But it is the most ambitious vision for the river since the channel was constructed, forward-looking and socially minded — a blueprint for encouraging legislators, private developers and community groups to come together around financing and new laws. It calls for tens of billions of dollars to go toward hundreds of projects in and around the river over the coming decades: the creation of a land bank, playing fields, cultural and community centers, public transportation and, of course, water management. Water and access to nature are treated as inseparable from issues like public transit and affordable housing.

The river traverses more than a dozen jurisdictions, flowing past almost every conceivable kind of neighborhood, through industrial zones, downtown and the urban wilderness of Griffith Park. It skirts the Warner Bros. and CBS studios on its northern end, and on its southern end divides some of the poorest towns in Southern California. In a sense, reimagining the river means reconsidering the governance and connectivity of the whole region.

Among the projects the master plan endorses is a proposal by the architect Frank Gehry for that southern stretch of the river. Collaborating with the landscape architect Laurie Olin and the engineering firm Geosyntec Consultants, Gehry imagines building platform parks levitated above the concrete channel at the river’s confluence with the Río Hondo and a new $150 million Gehry-designed cultural center beside the parks.

This is the area of the Gateway Cities, which include South Gate, Lynwood, Downey, Compton and Bell Gardens, and which for decades benefited from generous federal support. When companies like General Motors and Firestone shuttered factories during the 1970s and ’80s, white working-class families fled the area, and Latino immigrants moved in. Residents soon began to suffer the effects of huge public disinvestment and of the toxic waste left by the departed industries. These same towns were bereft of green parks and open spaces, a common determinant of public health. Today residents of southeast Los Angeles live, on average, a decade less than residents in neighborhoods on Los Angeles’s west side, a statistic that Gehry says stirred him to conceive the platform parks.

“When the former mayor of South Gate came to see me with his 4-year-old son,” Gehry recalls, “and said his son had a 10-year-shorter life span than kids on the west side because he doesn’t have enough parks and open spaces, that really hit me.”

His proposal involves constructing immense platforms or decks — holding troughs of dirt that support a landscape of hills, trees, horse paths and walking trails — creating green bridges as much as a mile long that span the two rivers. During extreme weather, the concrete channel can rapidly fill to the top of the embankment walls. The platform parks, raised on concrete stilts several feet above those walls, allow floodwaters to flow unimpeded into the Pacific. “We studied the river upside and down,” Gehry says, “and found that less than 1 percent of the time it runs very fast and is very dangerous. That meant we couldn’t remove the concrete, because it would cause the river to flood. So, we thought maybe we could deck the river instead.”

Some of the opposition to the master plan and to Gehry’s proposals comes from environmentalists who are pressing for a more natural version of the river. And some of it is from community activists who fear that any new development (not least development by an architect like Gehry, known for glamorous projects like the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain) will trigger displacement of poor residents. Among the naysayers is a venerable organization called Friends of the Los Angeles River, founded by the Texas-born poet and performance artist Lewis MacAdams. In 1985, MacAdams enlisted three friends to cross the First Street Bridge with him and cut a hole in a fence along the river. The quartet clambered down into the channel and walked upstream past the old city jail, to where Capt. Gaspar de Portolá and Spanish colonists first came upon the river and its centuries-old settlements of native Tongva, Kizh and Tataviam people in 1769.

For MacAdams, who died in 2020, removing concrete and restoring the waterway became a lifelong crusade, what he called his “40-year artwork to bring the Los Angeles River back to life.” That campaign is now carried on by, among others, Dennis Mabasa, chief operating officer for Friends of the Los Angeles River. We met one sweltering September afternoon at the Willow Street Estuary in Long Beach, south of the Gateway Cities. This is where 20 miles of concrete ends and the flood channel regains its natural bottom before swelling into the ocean.

The goal, Mabasa said, should not be building decks over the concrete channel but looking at removing it, installing permeable pavement and capturing more storm water. Mabasa cited a 2016 report done by the Army Corps of Engineers suggesting that restoring natural habitats could help mitigate the impact of severe floods and lessen strains on the channel, which FoLAR contends would make possible more spots like the Willow Street Estuary.

“Who wouldn’t want more of the river to look like this?” Mabasa asked as I watched an egret wade through brackish water. It was hard to disagree.

Concrete pouring for channelization, 1938.

Jessica Henson, who wrote much of the county master plan and is a partner at Olin, the landscape architecture firm founded by Laurie Olin and Robert Hanna, says that a 2021 FoLAR study on the feasibility of habitat restoration and flood mitigation in the Glendale Narrows shows the problems with this approach. The study expresses a vision that concrete can be removed and natural vegetation restored in targeted stretches of the river, without increasing flood risk or displacing any residents.

Just as FoLAR doesn’t believe that the county and Olin have fully considered alternative scenarios, the county and Olin insist FoLAR is ignoring the basic science. In fact, the master plan recommends soft-bottom improvements in some places. But removing concrete and returning grasses and other natural features slows floodwaters, Henson told me, causing the water to build up and potentially breach the embankments unless the channel is significantly widened. That, in turn, would require moving communities along its banks, not to mention many factories and much of the county’s critical infrastructure. Henson says that large-scale habitat repair along the lines FoLAR envisions would displace between 60,000 and 100,000 people. “Construction of Interstate 105, which opened in 1993, displaced 25,000 people in neighborhoods like Watts and Compton,” Henson added. “Widening the river would repeat that history at a far greater scale. L.A. hasn’t had a giant flood in years, but it’s only a matter of time, and the areas most at risk are among the county’s poorest.”

FoLAR says that the group and its allies advocate for strategic partial concrete removal that keeps or increases current levels of flood risk management, and that they do not advocate for any measures that would displace residents.

For his part, Gehry told me he hoped to remove the concrete but the facts didn’t allow it: “Two movie guys came to me after the opening of the High Line,” he said, referring to the park atop an abandoned railway viaduct in Manhattan, “and they said: New York is doing this exciting thing. Would I look at the river and see whether Los Angeles could do something like it? I thought, Well, the river runs through all these different communities, maybe we could make a great park out of it if we got rid of the concrete — which seemed a beautiful idea, a 51-mile garden — and so we worked on that plan for two years, pro bono, because I simply refused to believe it wasn’t possible.”

But he and his partner on the project, Tensho Takemori, couldn’t figure out how to engineer the concrete away. “We did all sorts of studies and finally accepted the fact that every once in a while Godzilla arrives and fills the channel up to the edge with water. We just did the research and stuck to the facts, and the facts were that communities along the river were suffering, they needed parks and open space and they also needed to be protected from floods. The platform parks were the only plan I could come up with that worked for that site.”

I asked him whether it was true that the platform parks, should they actually move ahead someday, might cost billions of public dollars to construct.

“With all the problems L.A. is facing,” he said, “even if it costs $50 billion to fix the river, we should just effing do it.”

The headwaters of the Los Angeles River aren’t easy to find. I stumbled on them in Canoga Park one morning, behind the local high school. That’s where two tributaries, Bell Creek and Arroyo Calabasas, converge in a Y-shaped funnel that the Army Corps of Engineers built to link them up with the river, whose concrete basin was nearly dry the morning I was there. It was hard to imagine a less Edenic setting for the wellspring of a great paradisiacal metropolis.

Every consideration of the river’s function ultimately comes down to how much water Los Angeles has at hand, whether too much or too little. For centuries, the river sustained small communities of native peoples. Under Spanish rule, and with the exploitation of Tongva labor, the river made the new pueblo the most important agricultural settlement on the Pacific Coast. It then nurtured hundreds of vineyards and orange groves during the 1800s, which spread Los Angeles’s reputation as a wonderland around the globe. But as the city grew, it drained marshes, chopped down trees along the riverbanks to make way for railroad tracks and paved over land that had helped mitigate floods. The city’s growing population, with newcomers soon consuming water at three times the rate residents did in many Eastern cities, placed unprecedented demands on the river, which it was eventually unable to meet. Droughts increasingly became even more of a threat than floods.

Farmland and the Los Angeles River before the 1920s.

Today, with climate change bringing ever-more-extreme weather, the river is no longer the sole or even a minor source of potable water for the county. But it remains integral to a vast, complex water-management system that regulates the flow and use of water across the entire region and that tries to anticipate both floods and droughts. This spring, residents in Canoga Park were among six million Southern Californians subject to new restrictions on water use because of a major drought. “We are seeing conditions unlike anything we have seen before,” Adel Hagekhalil, general manager for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, told The Los Angeles Times.

Officials in Los Angeles say they’re prepared for future droughts. Since 2007, both total and per capita water usage in California have significantly declined. Angelenos now use 44 percent less water per person annually than they did during the early 1980s, according to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The drop is thanks to water treatment facilities, more water-efficient appliances and various conservation policies, according to authorities.

That said, there’s still plenty of cause for concern. Los Angeles now imports about half of its water from the Los Angeles Aqueduct and another 40 percent from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which relies on the Colorado River and Northern California. Both the Owens and Colorado Rivers have suffered from droughts, and their reliability is increasingly uncertain; the drought that forced restrictions on residents in Southern California this spring included Northern California. As the hydrologist Newsha Ajami told Bloomberg News, droughts “ripple through the system,” adding, “That’s the problem with imported water.”

For authorities, the various sources of imported water are precisely what safeguard Los Angeles, creating the equivalent of a balanced investment portfolio: When one source becomes stressed, the others can make up for its losses. To demonstrate how the local system operates, Martin Adams, general manager of the city’s Department of Water and Power, and Mark Pestrella, director of the county’s Department of Public Works, which oversees flood management, took me one afternoon on a helicopter ride over the Los Angeles River, the San Gabriel Mountains and the San Fernando Valley. It was a sweltering day, and through headphones over the whoosh of the helicopter’s rotor, the two of them pointed out the area’s network of dams, spreading grounds and reservoirs, diamond-dusted in the high sun. In 2019, Los Angeles County captured 97 billion gallons of water in the reservoirs, enough to supply 2.4 million residents with water for a year. We flew over construction sites that Adams told me would soon become some of the largest groundwater treatment plants in the world. There are also upgrades underway to local wastewater treatment plants. The goal, Adams said, is that, by 2045, 70 percent of the city’s water will come from local sources, from storm-water capture and groundwater, not imported, at great cost, from faraway rivers. Which also means that Los Angeles can continue to grow, responsibly building much-needed new multifamily housing without overtaxing the water supply.

As for the Los Angeles River and the concrete flood channel, Adams gestured at hundreds of square miles of houses, highways and office buildings below us. “Look at it,” he said. “Hydrologists have studied the problem. Even if all the development in the San Fernando Valley was magically gone and the valley became a giant sponge, it still wouldn’t capture enough rain during the heaviest storms to prevent severe flooding downstream, which is only getting worse with climate change. That’s why the flood channel remains necessary.”

Pestrella agreed: “Millions of people are simply not going to move out of the valley or agree to leave their homes along the river. You’re also not going to move all those rail and power lines that run right along the channel. Much of the time the channel is dry. But on those rare days when the rains are worst, the channel does its job.”

“Increasingly, the river has become a catalyst for talking not just about water but also equity, affordable housing, habitat restoration — all of it together,” says Jon Christensen, an environmental historian at U.C.L.A. “In 1996, many Angelenos didn’t know there was a river. Now they say they not only know the river exists but that they want it to be everything, that it represents all sorts of goals for the city, which you can call a problem, because some of the goals are contradictory and unrealistic, but is also a sign that the river is a place where dreams and hopes about the city are coming together. I’m not saying it is front-of-mind for most Angelenos. It isn’t. But it is helping to focus more attention on some of our big challenges.”

I first started visiting the river nearly a decade ago, when Los Angeles was going through an earlier drought. Rents were rising, as were the numbers of homeless people, some of whom I found camped under bridges on its banks. With a landscape architect and urbanist named Mia Lehrer, who for years has designed parks and promenades and reimagined other parts of the river, I kayaked along a bumpy, natural-bottom stretch. With Mayor Eric Garcetti, I toured a 42-acre patch of brownfield in 2018 that the city acquired from the Union Pacific Railroad, in Cypress Park. The mayor talked about growing up near the river and about turning the vacant parcel into a green jewel. The project is still in development.

The site sits across from Elysian Valley, a neighborhood also called Frogtown, which has become Exhibit A for green gentrification on the river. In 2004, Julia Meltzer founded a nonprofit there called Clockshop, which is working to establish a new state park called the Bowtie adjacent to the mayor’s brownfield site. Meltzer was stunned by how rapidly Elysian Valley gentrified. “I remember the change happening rapidly after the stock-market crash in 2008,” she recalled, “when real estate investors started capitalizing on talk about improving the river, and then in 2014 when the Army Corps of Engineers got federal money to do some things FoLAR wanted.

“Taco trucks disappeared,” she went on. “An upscale taco place took over a Mazda repair shop. Artists moved in. MacAdams spread the notion of letting the river out of her corset, which was fueled by a nostalgic dream. It moved many people emotionally. And it began to expose conflicts between environmentalists who wanted habitats and community residents who wanted playing fields and not to be priced out of their neighborhood. They aren’t the same thing.”

During the past several years, real estate developers, seeing the potential for rising property values, have been gobbling up properties not just in Frogtown but in other places near the river. The county master plan recommends but cannot institute regulations like rent controls, which are up to each town and city. In August, Bell Gardens passed a town rent-stabilization and tenant-eviction protection ordinance out of fears that predatory developers would push out poor tenants in anticipation of Gehry’s parks and an extension of the Metro line. The master plan also encourages but can’t require the construction of affordable housing, and the county now has in place inclusionary zoning regulations for new multifamily developments at only a few riverside spots.

This is why some critics have argued that the plan is not attentive enough to community interests. Wilma Franco, executive director of the SELA Collaborative, represents various community groups in Southeast Los Angeles, including East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice, which has declined to back the master plan. Franco told me that people in the area want parks but fear the consequences. She said Gehry and his team have been open to ideas from community members like including a culinary school at the cultural center. But, as is widely acknowledged, it’s the county that needs to pass laws to prevent displacement. “There is excitement in the area about resources coming in,” Franco said, “but a lot of cynicism because of decades of broken promises and disinvestment. Our cement parks are 110 degrees in the summer. Our kids have no place to play baseball or soccer. But changes along the river can’t be driven by developers.”

Sissy Trinh, executive director of the Southeast Asian Community Alliance, agrees. Her office in Chinatown is just a short walk from the river. She told me she never paid much attention to the river before 2014, when the Army Corps of Engineers, lobbied by river advocates for years, secured $1.6 billion in federal funds to restore habitats and create bike trails and wetlands along an 11-mile stretch that runs from Griffith Park to downtown. For Trinh’s Chinatown constituents, the news that more than $1 billion would go to redevelop their backyard seemed both an opportunity and a threat.

“Chinatown is one of the poorest neighborhoods in Los Angeles, where the median income is closer to Skid Row than to South L.A.,” Trinh told me. “It’s an area historically devastated by the intrusions of the 110, 101 and 5 freeways, the Union Pacific and light rail lines, by rail yards and a prison, not to mention by commuters avoiding bottlenecks on the freeways by speeding through our streets. We have been feeling the impact of gentrification for years, which for many of our residents leads directly to homelessness. I am talking about a population of seniors, many of whom literally can’t afford a $4 monthly rent increase.

“When I started talking about housing in public meetings about the river, some environmentalists would tell me, ‘That’s too big an issue, it’s mission drift,’ and they would change the subject. But it isn’t mission drift. Poor communities should not have to choose between a more beautiful neighborhood and a home.”

Trinh recalled how she and other community leaders gradually began to shift the conversation toward solutions like land banking and rent control, topics reflected in the new master plan. Coalitions have started forming, she says, “around green gentrification, displacement avoidance, affordable housing — the river has become an opportunity to link equitable development with environmental justice and open space.”

As proof that all this is having some tangible, albeit still modest, effect on politicians, Trinh cites a motion the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors passed this June setting aside $50 million to establish a land bank for affordable housing. A $50 million land bank may seem a token gesture in a region where a single home can cost twice that and there are few affordable apartments or protections for renters. But the point, Christensen from U.C.L.A. says, echoing Trinh, “is that the broader conversation about the river around equity and housing is spilling over.”

Hubris and wishful thinking are at the heart of any large-scale urban undertaking. No matter how clever or sensitive to the problems of its time, a project that looks to be a solution can itself turn out to be the problem.

In July, the $588 million Sixth Street Viaduct opened. It spans the flood channel where the gentrified Arts District on the west side of the river faces Boyle Heights, a historically working-class neighborhood, on the east side. Replacing an Art Deco landmark, the new bridge became an overnight sensation on Instagram and attracted mobs of fans who camped out on it, making music and partying, blocking traffic. Its popularity resurfaced longstanding concerns about gentrification in Boyle Heights.

The bridge is architecturally striking: a graceful sequence of arches, akin to looping strips of film that tilt over the river. To a driver crossing the bridge, the arches can seem to move like a dancer or a galloping horse in one of Muybridge’s motion studies.

Parks are still being built on either end of the bridge: a lawn on the Arts District side, and tucked beneath the bridge on the Boyle Heights side, acres of playing fields. I met the bridge’s architect, Michael Maltzan, one recent afternoon. He walked me to a cul-de-sac near the center of the bridge, so we could gaze directly over the flood channel, across a panorama of rail lines and industrial warehouses toward the downtown skyline.

“Infrastructure like this defined postwar L.A.,” he said. “The flood channel was built to speed water out of the city, which it divided. Freeways were built to provide access and speed to automobiles, but they turned out to separate people and different parts of the city along racial and economic lines. My hope is that the new bridge doesn’t come to be seen as an instrument of gentrification but suggests a different vision of what infrastructure can accomplish in terms of connecting, not separating, diverse neighborhoods.” He cited the confluence of Angelenos who came to celebrate the opening.

“Los Angeles has always sold a dream of individual fulfillment,” Maltzan went on. “But the river requires collective action and imagination. We’ve crossed a threshold from people thinking it’s preposterous that the river is a vital part of city life to it seeming an inevitability. And now we’re feeling the frictions that arise when people become invested in something and things start moving forward.”

A spiral ramp led from the bridge down toward the street on the Boyle Heights side. From the ramp, Maltzan stopped to point out where the playing fields would go. The bridge will provide much-needed shade on hot days, he said. I noticed an empty dirt lot beside the bridge, flanking the lot where the fields will be. The city leased the lot during construction of the bridge from its private owner. Now the lease has expired. An image popped to mind of a skyscraper rising on the site, overshadowing the bridge, bringing an army of gentrifiers to Boyle Heights.

“I hope the city finds a way to buy the lot,” Maltzan said.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,1,1,1,0.9971,"['United States', 'Panama', 'Spain']","['Colorado', 'Hudson', 'San Gabriel', 'Los Angeles', 'Bell Gardens', 'South Gate', 'Much', 'New York', 'San Fernando', 'North Hollywood', 'Lynwood', 'Long Beach', 'Bilbao', 'Boyle Heights', 'Canoga Park', 'Compton', 'Manhattan', 'Downey', 'Hollywood']"

In the Western U.S., droughts contributed to wildfires causing air-quality warnings thousands of miles away. In usually wet and temperate Britain, the first-ever heat warning was issued. In China, record rains caused deadly floods. Each of these events took place within the space of a few days last week, and each was likely spurred by climate change.

One way to make a difference on a personal level is to ditch your fossil-fuel-powered car. Transportation is responsible for about 29 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, which reports that abandoning just one car would save roughly 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide from escaping into the environment each year.

Of course, going carless is easier in some places than in others. A recent study by LawnStarter compared the 150 largest U.S. cities to find which were best (and worst) for living without a car. Results were based on metrics related to walking, biking, commuting, safety (pedestrian fatalities, for example) and weather (some places are just too cold or too hot to hoof it.)

San Francisco, despite ranking 81st among the 150 cities for safety, came out on top, largely because of its mild climate and high commuting scores (and despite its challenging hills).

The Western United States received a lot more snow than usual this season, much of it unleashed by punishing storms that battered California especially hard throughout the winter. Parts of the Eastern half of the country, however, saw much less snow than normal amid unusually warm winter temperatures.

It’s not uncommon for the two coasts to experience opposing weather conditions. This can happen when the jet stream, a band of winds that blow from west to east around the planet, starts to meander into a wavelike pattern. This wind pattern results in cooler conditions where it dips southward and warmer conditions where it arcs northward.

The timing of precipitation and freezing temperatures also influenced this year’s unsettling winter season, said Karin Gleason, a climate scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

In some cases, precipitation just happened to fall at the same time that temperatures were cold enough for snow to form, Ms. Gleason added. But, if temperatures were too warm, more precipitation may have fallen as rain, rather than snow.

“It’s a conspiring of different factors,” she said.

A Cold, Snowy Winter for the West

Percent of average cumulative snowfall

A succession of atmospheric river storms pummeled Western states from late December to January, and again in March. These storms were largely responsible for dumping record amounts of snow across much of the West. The Western United States also experienced colder-than-normal temperatures this winter, which helped snow to fall and stick to the ground.

Some of that winter snow fell at unusually low elevations, from a range of 500 to 2,000 feet, a rare sight in regions like the hills overlooking the San Francisco Bay Area. Warming temperatures over the past decades have generally resulted in snow that is concentrated at colder, higher elevations, said David Simeral, a research scientist with the Desert Research Institute.

Colder-than-normal temperatures across much of the West also helped build up and sustain a deep snowpack in California’s Sierra Nevada and parts of the intermountain West, including northern Arizona, western Colorado, Nevada and Utah.

April 1 is a benchmark date for when water managers expect snowpack to peak. On that day, the average statewide snowpack levels — as measured by the amount of liquid water available in the snow — were more than double the historical average for California. In the southern Sierras, which generally receives less snow, average snowpack levels reached 62.6 inches, nearly triple the historical amount.

Healthy snowpack and replenished reservoirs have helped ease California out of its long-term drought, the driest three-year stretch on record. The extremely wet Western winter has also improved the long-term precipitation shortfalls that had accumulated over several years, bringing parts of western Oregon, southern Idaho, Nevada and central Utah out of extreme drought.

Though the record-deep snowpack will bring welcome water supply benefits to large swaths of the West in the spring, it also poses a greater risk of flooding as the snow melts, especially if temperatures rise quickly.

A Warm, Rainy Winter for the East

A different pattern occurred in the East, where snow has been elusive for many cities that regularly expect it. Instead, warmer-than-normal winter weather brought more rain than snow.

After 328 consecutive snowless days, New York City finally recorded 0.4 inch of snow on Feb. 1. Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., also went more than 300 days without measurable snow — defined as at least a tenth of an inch.

“This winter hasn’t been unusual in terms of total precipitation,” said Aiguo Dai, an atmospheric science professor at the University at Albany, SUNY. But the warmer weather has meant that more precipitation than usual in the Northeast has fallen as rain, rather than snow, Dr. Dai said.

The phenomenon is known as a warm snow drought, and it is likely to occur more frequently as a result of warming temperatures, experts say.

When temperatures were cold enough, precipitation did not always fall in large amounts, which was the case when a bitterly cold wind chill gripped the Northeast in early February.

Though much of the Northeast urban corridor had been spared harsh winter weather this season, a deadly blizzard early in the winter dumped several feet of snow in Buffalo.

1748,2022-09-14,China Is Writing the Story of the Climate Future,"But it isn’t only lack of information that blinds us. An unprecedented climate episode in China is also hard for Americans to process because the country occupies such an unsettled role in the stories we tell ourselves, and try to tell the world, about warming — often moralistic ones, about good actors and bad, guilt and innocence. When extreme weather strikes China, the “meaning,” beyond the obvious one, is more muddled. If we don’t know what to make of China, the climate actor, we have a much harder time making sense of its climate suffering.

For years, China has served as a convenient rhetorical touchstone for the climate-minded on both left and right — often described as a bad actor and unreliable partner by climate and energy nationalists, and by agitated environmentalists as an example of what could be done, climatewise, given a political structure without so many troublesome veto points. These contradictory depictions have always depended much more on casual stereotype than genuine insight. But like any useful talking point, they are also built on something real. China is not just the world’s largest climate polluter but is responsible now for about half of all global coal use and almost a third of all global carbon emissions — a growing share, and more than twice the American contribution. (Though on a per-capita basis, the United States is still doing much worse.)

But if China is doing much more damage now to the future of the climate than any other nation, it is also the case that the country has been the strongest force for clean energy over the past decade. Last year, China installed more renewable capacity than was rolled out in the United States, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa combined. And although the plunge in the price of renewables is often regarded as an authorless global market success story, probably the largest contribution to that price collapse has been investment and innovation in Chinese manufacturing (quite a lot of it under horrifying conditions in Xinjiang).

If the story ended there, it would be confounding enough: China, as a global behemoth, simultaneously playing hero and villain. But China also seems to occupy a confusing place in the landscape of climate geopolitics because that landscape has shifted lately as well. Ten years ago, or even five, climate diplomacy often meant rhetorical appeals to global cooperation mixed with realpolitik efforts to move more slowly than your rivals. Today, decarbonization is still happening much too slowly, but fast enough to move the diplomatic dynamics away from a rivalry of inaction toward an apparent rivalry of action. Climate investment is booming in the United States, and with the CHIPS act and the I.R.A. climate bill now passed into law, the country has affirmatively joined what Politico recently called a new “green-energy arms race.”

The power dynamics are shifting, too, not just in terms of trade deals, saber-rattling about Taiwan and China’s recent cancellation of bilateral climate talks after Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei. Since the global financial crisis, but especially since the election of Donald Trump and the bungling of the early American pandemic response, those indulging narratives of American decline often looked to China as a forbidding and inevitable successor: endowed with an overwhelming population, directed by a relatively frictionless model of booming state capitalism and unencumbered by the kinds of political dysfunction that seem unavoidable here. The country remains an obvious geopolitical rival, and just passed the United States in one measure of scientific contribution: publishing the world’s most-cited journal papers.

But over the longer term, the economic fallout caused by climate change is likely to be profound.

Devastating fires, floods and droughts tend to dominate the headlines. Other insidious effects may generate less attention but nonetheless take a toll. Researchers have found that extreme temperatures reduce labor productivity, damage crops, raise mortality rates, disrupt global trade and dampen investment.

An analysis by researchers associated with the Centre for Economic Policy Research found that in Europe, France, Italy, Spain, Romania and Germany have been most affected by climate-related disasters over the past 20 years. Central and Eastern European countries, however, have been increasingly hit with climate troubles.

Such developments put added pressure on public spending, as governments are called on to replace damaged infrastructure and provide subsidies and relief.

1753,2023-08-16,The Age of the Urban Inferno Is Here,"It wasn’t even really a wildfire. By the time the flames passed through Lahaina, Hawaii — burning a beloved 150-year-old banyan tree and throwing embers so far that when residents jumped into the ocean for relief, they saw the hulls of boats floating among them on fire, too — it had long since left the wild land behind. Instead it had become another instance of what the climate scientist Daniel Swain memorably called the return of the “urban firestorm.”

The string of examples is growing: the Tubbs fire in Santa Rosa, Calif., in 2017; the Camp fire in Paradise, Calif., the following year; and the Marshall fire in Boulder County, Colo., in 2021, which after burning through a lot of nearby vegetation made a jump to a shopping center with a Costco and a Chuck E. Cheese and ultimately destroyed more than 1,000 homes. You might think of these events as having two ignitions: the first when the natural landscape begins to burn, from a lightning strike or a dropped match or a downed power line, and the second when that fire, often supercharged by climate conditions, makes the jump to buildings and cars and other forms of modern infrastructure and keeps burning.

In general, we’ve long believed the built environment offered formidable firebreaks and worried over what might be lost when fires passed near homes as a form of tragic collateral damage. But increasingly, fires emerging hotter and more intense from the natural landscape are burning human structures not as collateral but as fuel, jumping from home to home as earlier fires would jump from tree crown to tree crown, with vegetation, Swain told me when I interviewed him in the wake of the Marshall fire for New York magazine, acting only as a wick. These firestorms may seem like a harbinger, he said, but they are also a throwback, to a time a century or more ago when towns and cities, in an era of wood-frame buildings and premodern firefighting, regularly stared down the threat of incineration by flame.

The Maui disaster has already become the deadliest American fire in over a century, surpassing the Camp fire, which incinerated 18,000 homes and structures and claimed 85 lives, with most of the damage coming in the first few hours of the fire. As of Tuesday, the official death toll in Maui was 99, but almost 1 percent of residents remained unaccounted for, and many locals were suggesting the death toll could increase significantly in the days ahead. The Hawaiian Islands are no stranger to fire, and for years fire scientists and fire officials and even the local utility warned of risk in this particular area, including that a wildfire could draft off exceptional wind provided by a passing typhoon. A climate lawsuit by Maui against Big Oil in 2020 specifically cited additional wildfire risk. But still, when the fire broke out, almost no one seemed adequately prepared. It grew almost immediately from nearby grassland into a huge urban conflagration, and first-person accounts were almost too grim to read, as were reports that early-warning alarms did not sound and that cellphone reception — on which we all now depend, especially in times of crisis and low-information panic — and 911 service were quickly lost as well.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,2,0,1,-0.9974,[],"['Santa Rosa', 'New York', 'Paradise', 'Marshall']"

At the start, the moves may not be extreme. Rural dwellers tend to migrate to nearby towns; those in towns shift to cities. And more dramatic moves — akin to the African American “Great Migration” in the first half of the 20th century, or those fleeing the Dust Bowl in the Depression — may come only later.

Lustgarten’s narrative sometimes bogs down with data and research arcana : Readers are frequently informed about the potential vulnerabilities of various states under various climate scenarios, as well as what a particular scholar may believe could happen to the American populace or agricultural yields.

What consistently enlivens the book are the author’s eloquent personal insights. His visits to Guatemala, especially, are astonishing as well as gripping, presenting an intimate understanding of why poor agricultural workers, beset by droughts and calamitous economic circumstances, risk everything to come to northern neighbors that greet them with hostility. For Lustgarten, this offers a test case for how the planet’s most vulnerable populations could respond in a climate emergency.

For those of us already living here, Lustgarten suggests that the decision to stay or go may depend on geography. For years, he points out, state and federal incentives have allowed Americans to settle in dangerous places — giving them cheap flood insurance if they reside in a flood zone, for instance, or offering subsidized or regulated home insurance policies even when they live in a wildfire area or near an eroding beach.

1756,2022-06-22,Why Summer Fires in California Are So Dangerous,"It’s almost July, which is typically the beginning of California’s fire season.

You’ve probably heard that wildfires in the Golden State have increasingly become a year-round danger, no longer limited to a few months a year. But even still, the start of the traditional summer-and-fall fire season brings a slew of heightened risks for us to contend with.

It’s true that drought conditions and extreme heat in California have increased the likelihood that fires break out in the winter. This year, in January, typically one of the state’s wettest periods, a wildfire swept through Big Sur — an event the National Weather Service called “surreal.”

But those off-season fires are generally low-intensity and less likely to exhibit the unpredictable and destructive behavior that has characterized the worst California fires in recent years. In 2020, more acres burned in the state than ever before, driven largely by massive fires that began in August and September.

“The ability for fires to burn straight through winter is probably increasing, but there’s still a very pronounced seasonality,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “I would bet a lot of money that August and September and October will see a whole lot more fire, and a whole lot more destructive fire.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.9666,['United States'],['Los Angeles']

After half a century of painstaking restoration under the Clean Water Act, streams and wetlands nationwide are once again at risk of contamination by pollution and outright destruction as a result of a ruling on Thursday by the Supreme Court.

The Environmental Protection Agency has long interpreted the Clean Water Act as protecting most of the nation’s wetlands from pollution. But now the court has significantly limited the reach of the law, concluding that it precludes the agency from regulating discharges of pollution into wetlands unless they have “a continuous surface connection” to bodies of water that, using “ordinary parlance,” the court described as streams, oceans, rivers and lakes.

Agreement between Republicans and Democrats to reduce the emissions that are causing the planet to warm is more elusive, as Republicans are largely resistant to limiting the use of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal.

As a result, Democrats in Congress and the Biden administration are aiming to fold more aggressive climate action into a separate budget bill, which Democrats hope to pass even without Republican votes.

The infrastructure bill, which could pass the Senate this week, still faces uncertainty in the House, where progressives oppose provisions to fund natural gas and nuclear plants, among other things. But money to protect communities from sea level rise and extreme weather has few opponents.

“The climate crisis impacts both red states and blue states alike,” Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware and chairman of the environment and public works committee, said in a statement. Many of his Republican colleagues, he added, “have seen firsthand how calamitous the consequences can be if we fail to invest in resilience.”

The bill would also fundamentally transform the country’s approach to preparing for climate change.

1759,2022-05-24,The Heat Is Already On,"Last week Stuart Kirk, the head of responsible investing (!) for HSBC’s asset management division, gave a talk titled “Why Investors Need Not Worry About Climate Risk,” in which he declared that it’s no big deal: “Who cares if Miami is six meters underwater in 100 years? Amsterdam has been six meters underwater for ages, and that’s a really nice place. We will cope with it.”

Kirk has reportedly been suspended, although The Financial Times also reports that his theme and content had been “approved internally” before the talk. Still, his self-immolation may be helpful in making a crucial counterpoint: Investors — and, more important, human beings — need to worry about climate risks right now. For climate change isn’t something that will happen decades in the future; its effects are happening as you read this. And while we may “cope with it” for a while, there will come a point when we can’t — and the scale of catastrophe will be immense.

There are several forms of climate denialism. Kirk simply offered one version — still unforgivable from someone who’s supposed to be a risk manager — which goes, “Hey, what’s the big deal if the planet gets a degree or two warmer?”

1760,2024-10-31,Climate Change Is Making Disasters Deadlier. Here’s How Much.,"Two weeks before world leaders meet to debate the climate crisis, a report released on Thursday shows the 10 deadliest extreme weather events in the past two decades were made worse by burning fossil fuels.

More than half a million people around the world were killed in those disasters since 2004.

“Many people now understand that climate change is already making life more dangerous,” said Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer at Imperial College London and co-founder of World Weather Attribution, the group that published the report. “What did not work yet is turning knowledge into action on a large-enough scale.”

Even with the abundance of evidence on how a warming world is endangering human life, the world keeps burning fossil fuels: 2023, the hottest year on record, also set a record for greenhouse gas emissions.

The stakes are high for how the world will respond in November, with a pivotal U.S. election and an annual climate summit of world leaders, known as COP29, hosted in Azerbaijan.

Massively, but Not Alone, Study Finds.","The 226 gigatons of storage cannot be achieved without cutting greenhouse gas emissions, said Thomas Crowther, the study’s senior author and a professor of ecology at ETH Zurich, a university in Switzerland. “If we continue emitting carbon, as we’ve done to date, then droughts and fires and other extreme events will continue to threaten the scale of the global forest system, further limiting its potential to contribute.”

Forests are essential to tackling both the climate and biodiversity crises. They offer food, shelter and shade to humans and countless other species. They clean our air and water. And they pull climate-warming carbon out of the atmosphere. As the climate crisis intensifies, that ability has made them controversial: How much can we rely on trees to get us out of this mess?

Dr. Crowther was the senior author of a polarizing study on forest carbon in 2019 that drew scientific backlash but also inspired an effort by the World Economic Forum to grow and conserve one trillion trees.

In 2019, he acknowledged, careless language led to trees being wrongly painted as a silver bullet for climate change. Now, his biggest fear is that countries and companies will keep treating forests that way, using them for carbon offsets to enable the continued use of fossil fuels.

“We are all terrified that this potential of nature gets misused,” Dr. Crowther said. “Nature has such spectacular potential to help us tackle global threats, but it will be devastating if major organizations use nature as an excuse to do more harm to our planet.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,1,0,-0.9766,"['United States', 'Switzerland']",[]
1762,2023-07-19,Global Warming Is Bringing More Change Than Just Heat,"The problem with fears about ‘climate refugees’

Climate-related mass migration, and the political consequences it produces, may have profound consequences in addition to rising temperatures themselves. But when I first started thinking about the issue, I was extrapolating from what I knew about another kind of forced migration: the refugee crises that result when people flee from persecution or conflict. And it turns out that wasn’t the right way to think about the situation at all.

Refugees, under international law, are people who have been forced to flee their own countries because of persecution. That means that a lot of refugee policy debates are essentially about countries’ obligations to vulnerable foreigners.

But climate change is most likely to displace people within their own countries, and drive them to seek protection from their own governments.

“When we talk about climate displacement, rather than thinking about future climate refugees across borders, we could already be thinking about people displaced by hurricanes or about more people displaced by fires in the United States,” said Stephanie Schwartz, a political scientist at the London School of Economics who studies forced migration. “It’s hard to make that switch psychologically, because it’s not other-ing refugees or migrants. It’s ‘we could be refugees or migrants.’”

In some extreme cases, such as Pacific islands threatened by rising sea levels, internal migration might not be possible. And climate disasters can also exacerbate other causes of cross-border migration, such as violence or weak labor markets.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,1,0,-0.989,['United States'],[]

All that precipitation has replenished California’s lakes and groundwater supplies; the state’s reservoirs are currently at 128 percent of the average for this time of year, according to state data. The bounty was particularly welcome (and surprising) after three years of extreme drought, said Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources.

“This was as close to a miracle year as you can get,” Nemeth said during a news conference this month. It wasn’t only the record rainfall to be thankful for, she said, but that an unusually mild spring and summer had prevented all that snow from melting rapidly and causing extreme flooding, which was a major concern earlier in the year.

The favorable weather has also probably helped quiet California’s fire season. So far, 317,191 acres have burned in California this year, compared with an average of 1.5 million by this point in the past five years. Especially helpful in Southern California were the summer rains from Hurricane Hilary, which brought a reprieve during what would otherwise have been peak fire season.

1765,2020-06-16,The Return of the Platypuses,"The returned platypuses were plumper, and different in another way as well: They’d been implanted with tracking devices as part of an ongoing study to better understand how platypuses behave, how they respond to changes in their habitats, and how they are faring in Australia — which is still a very open question, explained Gilad Bino, a researcher at the University of New South Wales who will be monitoring the Tidbinbilla platypuses. “Everyone seems to assume that if it’s out of sight it’s probably doing OK,” he said. But his research suggests that platypuses, thanks to unsustainable water use and climate-driven drought, are actually in considerable trouble: extinct in 40 percent of their historical range, with bigger losses coming as climate change intensifies.

Tahneal Hawke, another University of New South Wales researcher, recently analyzed nearly 26,000 records of interactions with platypuses, going back to 1760: newspaper articles, explorers’ journals, books of natural history. The results, for modern platypus researchers, make for surreal reading. Dr. Bino was struck to read about people seeing (or shooting) platypuses by the dozen, or using terms like “mob” or “migration.” “I would never, in our years of studying platypuses, describe them that way,” he said.

The final four platypuses returned to Tidbinbilla on June 5. Their receivers, Dr. Meagher reported, “are tracking them happily moving about the ponds.” People who saw the platypuses slip into their recovered habitats described doing so with a feeling of relief, even of magic, after a painful summer. But Dr. May can’t shake the memory of those desperate days in December, when the air was orange and the bush crackled with dryness. And Dr. Bino warns that the story of happy news disguises a more alarming larger picture. “Rescuing platypuses from drying ponds is not really a viable strategy” for the survival of the species, he said.

But the move toward solar is global: the study’s authors expect solar to be the cheapest source of electricity in almost all countries by 2027.

If the I.E.A.’s projections come to pass, oil and gas demand would most likely plateau at slightly above today’s levels for the next three decades, expanding in developing countries and shrinking in advanced economies. Demand for coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels, would start declining, though it might fluctuate year to year if, say, coal plants needed to run more often during heat waves or droughts.

On Thursday, the administration fired 3,400 employees from the U.S. Forest Service, which manages 193 million acres of land, about the size of Texas. This comes on top of a funding freeze also ordered by the administration that has interrupted work designed to clear national forests of vegetation that can feed wildfires.

That work has grown increasingly important as wildfires become more frequent and intense because of drought and other conditions linked to climate change.

The job cuts, which amount to roughly 10 percent of the agency’s work force, could hobble the Forest Service, which was already struggling to remove vegetation across its vast land holdings at a pace that matches the growing threat from fires, according to current and former federal employees, as well as private companies and nonprofit organizations that work on thinning forested lands.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,-0.8479,['United States'],['Texas']

For 150 years of industrialization, the combustion of coal, oil and gas has steadily released heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, driving up average global temperatures and setting heat records. Nearly everywhere around the world, heat waves are more frequent and longer lasting than they were 70 years ago.

But a hotter planet does not hurt equally. If you’re poor and marginalized, you’re likely to be much more vulnerable to extreme heat. You might be unable to afford an air-conditioner, and you might not even have electricity when you need it. You may have no choice but to work outdoors under a sun so blistering that first your knees feel weak and then delirium sets in. Or the heat might bring a drought so punishing that, no matter how hard you work under the sun, your corn withers and your children turn to you in hunger.

It’s not like you can just pack up and leave. So you plant your corn higher up the mountain. You bathe several times a day if you can afford the water. You powder your baby to prevent heat rash. You sleep outdoors when the power goes out, slapping mosquitoes. You sit in front of a fan by yourself, cursed by the twin dangers of isolation and heat.

Extreme heat is not a future risk. It’s now. It endangers human health, food production and the fate of entire economies. And it’s worst for those at the bottom of the economic ladder in their societies. See what it’s like to live with one of the most dangerous and stealthiest hazards of the modern era.

Savings from the drug price negotiation policy may end up being lower, and the savings from limits on drug price increases are unofficial estimates based on an analysis by Don Schneider, a former chief economist of the House Ways and Means Committee. Figures are in billions and over 10 years.

The bill includes policies lowering the prices of prescription drugs; increasing the generosity of Medicare benefits; and encouraging the development of renewable energy and reducing the impact of climate change.

It would also raise taxes on some corporations and bolster the ability of the Internal Revenue Service to crack down on wealthy tax evaders. It would lower the federal deficit, though modestly.

The bill includes last-minute changes requested by Senator Kyrsten Sinema, Democrat of Arizona, the final holdout among her party’s 50 senators. Democratic leaders agreed to remove a tax on some wealthy hedge fund managers and private equity executives, and to include $4 billion in drought funding for her state.

Savings from the drug price negotiation policy may end up being lower, and the savings from limits on drug price increases are unofficial estimates based on an analysis by Don Schneider, a former chief economist of the House Ways and Means Committee.

But if the current bill includes a lot — in spending, new taxes and policies — it also omits a lot of the Democrats’ original ambitions. Missing is an entire set of family policies that were in a bill passed by the House last year, like a generous child tax credit and paid family leave.

Certain health policies, such as an expansion of Medicaid to give more low-income adults health insurance, have been removed to pare down the bill’s cost. And though the climate policies are the most expansive passed by any Congress, they are more modest than those included in earlier versions of the legislation.

The current bill includes clean electricity incentives that are comparable in size to those in a version passed by the House last year. But it scales back spending in almost every other category, from transportation to climate resilience. Some proposed investments from earlier versions — like those for lead remediation, work force development such as a Civilian Climate Corps, and electric bicycle tax credits — did not make it into the new text. The one major exception is manufacturing: Compared with previous versions of the bill, this legislation marks a significant increase in grants, loans and tax credits to manufacture clean energy technology domestically.

But it also pairs new climate spending with several major concessions to the fossil fuel industry at the request of Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, whose support was necessary to advance the bill.

Here’s how the legislation compares with the much larger social safety net and climate bill passed by the House in November, often referred to as Build Back Better.

$8 $50 Total $764 billion $2 trillion *The figure for the Inflation Reduction Act is a rough estimate because of changes to the drug price provisions in the bill after cost and savings estimates were released. Savings from the drug price negotiation policy may end up being lower, and the savings from limits on drug price increases are unofficial estimates based on an analysis by Don Schneider, a former chief economist of the House Ways and Means Committee.

The Inflation Reduction Act is projected to reduce deficits by roughly $275 billion over 10 years, while the Build Back Better plan passed by the House would have added about $160 billion to deficits.

Democrats have said the new bill’s deficit reduction, as well as the provisions aimed at lowering energy and prescription drug costs, will help address the rapid inflation over the past year. Many economists, including supporters of the bill, have said that while it may reduce price pressures, the overall effect is likely to be modest, and over the long term.

The promise of taming inflation helped bring Mr. Manchin on board, who cited concerns about rising prices when he pulled his support from the bill passed by the House last year.

In a statement last month after an agreement on a new bill had been made with Democratic leadership, Mr. Manchin announced, “Build Back Better is dead, and instead we have the opportunity to make our country stronger by bringing Americans together.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,natural disaster,1,0,0,0.9999,"['United States', 'Mexico']",['Green']

As the state’s two major sources of water, groundwater and the Colorado River, dwindle from drought, climate change and overuse, officials are considering a hydrological Hail Mary: the construction of a plant in Mexico to suck salt out of seawater, then pipe that water hundreds of miles, much of it uphill, to Phoenix.

The idea of building a desalination plant in Mexico has been discussed in Arizona for years. But now, a $5 billion project proposed by an Israeli company is under serious consideration, an indication of how worries about water shortages are rattling policymakers in Arizona and across the American West.

On June 1, the state announced that the Phoenix area, the fastest-growing region in the country, doesn’t have enough groundwater to support all the future housing that has already been approved.

1779,2022-10-04,Meet the Band of TV Animals That’s Talking to Preschoolers About Climate,"Four-year-old Francis Gaskin, who lives with his family in Houston, has a favorite episode of his favorite new Netflix cartoon: When the Amazon rainforest canopy dries up from too much heat, the manic howler monkeys must move into the lower realms of the forest, creating havoc among the other rainforest residents. “They had to find a new home,” Francis explained during a video interview.

“I noticed something else,” the preschooler added. “The frogs were going to lay their eggs in the water, but there was no water in the stream because there was zero rain.”

“Sometimes the Earth warms up,” he said.

Francis’ favorite show is “Octonauts: Above and Beyond,” the recent spinoff of a long-running BBC program, and one of the first television shows directed at very young children to explicitly address climate change. The program attempts to strike a delicate balance: gently showing 3- and 4-year-olds that their world is already changing, without frightening them with the consequences.

Climate scientists say its depictions are largely accurate, with one striking omission. The program says nothing about why the Earth is heating up: the burning of oil, gas and coal.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,0.9143,[],['Houston']
1780,2022-08-09,Fighting inflation with climate action,"Democrats this weekend muscled through what would be the biggest expenditure ever by the United States to slow global warming, but you wouldn’t necessarily know from the name of the measure that it had anything to do with climate.

The $370 billion bill — designed to move the country away from fossil fuels and toward solar, wind and other renewable energy — is called the Inflation Reduction Act, and it’s expected to pass the House this week. (In case you don’t remember, Senator Joe Manchin III cited inflation as a big reason for not supporting an earlier version of the bill.)

The name, in fact, is fitting because there’s a direct connection between climate change and rising prices, no matter where you are in the world. Today I’ll explain that link and talk about how the those billions in spending could actually help reduce, not increase, inflationary pressures in the future.

The ‘fossilflation’ problem

Fossil fuels are subject to abrupt changes in supply, and those changes can cause shocks in energy markets that fuel inflation around the world. We’re seeing that now with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and we’ve seen it before. In the late 1970s, for instance, sharp reductions in Middle Eastern oil exports made energy prices surge in the United States. At one point, inflation rose to 9 percent.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,0.7375,"['United States', 'Ukraine']",[]
1781,2024-08-01,Where Potential Democratic V.P. Candidates Stand on Climate,"Vice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has a long history as a climate-minded politician. As California’s attorney general, she prosecuted polluters, and as a U.S. senator she cosponsored the Green New Deal, a resolution that called on the nation to pivot away from fossil fuels but that never passed the Congress. During her time as vice president, she helped broker the largest climate deal in U.S. history, the $370 billion Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Now, the choice of running mate could help bolster her climate and energy agenda, or moderate her stance for voters in swing states. A rally is scheduled for Tuesday in Philadelphia and Ms. Harris is expected to appear with her chosen running mate.

So, where do some of the top contenders stand on climate policies?

Josh Shapiro, Governor of Pennsylvania

Last week, Gov. Josh Shapiro secured the second largest federal grant in Pennsylvania history, almost $400 million, to create 6,000 jobs and cut industrial pollution in President Biden’s home state. The funds highlight Governor Shapiro’s approach to addressing climate change in the region: use the crisis as an opportunity to employ workers, revitalize the economy and lower electric bills through the state’s version of a cap-and-trade policy.

As a candidate, he set goals to generate 30 percent of the state’s energy from renewables by 2030, a nearly 10-fold increase, and to stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2050.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,news analysis,0,0,0,0.9109,['United States'],"['Philadelphia', 'Deal']"
1782,2023-12-21,The Year in Climate Culture,"2023 was a year when climate change felt inescapable. Whether it was the raging wildfires in Canada, the orange skies in New York, the flash floods in Libya or the searing heat in China, the effects of our overheating planet were too severe to ignore.

Not coincidentally, it was also a year when climate change started to feel ubiquitous in popular culture. Glossy TV shows, best-selling books, art exhibits and even pop music tackled the subject, often with the kind of nuance and creativity that can help us make sense of the world’s thorniest issues.

Here are some highlights from the year in climate culture.

“The Deluge” by Stephen Markley

This bracing and beguiling novel tracks a cadre of radicalized scientists and activists from the gathering storm of the Obama years to the super-typhoons of the 2040s. Hamilton Cain, the Times book reviewer, writes: “The dystopia is realistic and nuanced, grim but playful, setting Markley’s book apart from the tsunami of recent climate-change literature.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,0.6369,"['United States', 'Canada', 'China', 'Libya']","['New York', 'Obama']"
1783,2023-07-10,The Southwest Bakes With More Heat on the Way,"“Looking at the current forecasts that we have, we’re forecasting temperatures at least 110 or above for at least the next seven to eight days and potentially longer,” Mr. Lojero said, adding that this streak could potentially break the 18-day record.

Isaac Smith, another meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Arizona, said that “we’re going to be looking at these very hot temperatures continuing through the next week.” The Weather Service, he added, expects highs to continue to remain above 110 degrees each day. “That’s pretty significant for us,” Mr. Smith said. “Even for Phoenix standards.”

“People certainly need to be taking precautions to protect themselves from the heat,” Mr. Smith added. “People need to keep in mind that heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer in the U.S.”

A report released by the Maricopa County Department of Public Health last month found that in 2022 there were 425 heat-associated deaths in the county, up 25 percent from the previous year. More than half of the heat-associated deaths occurred in the month of July, according to the report, and 107 of the deaths occurred on days with an excessive heat warning.

Still, throughout the region, people are finding ways to make do and assessing how much of the heat this year is extraordinary, and how much just feels like summer in the South and the Southwest.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,2,0,0,0.5859,['United States'],['Phoenix']
1784,2023-03-15,Yet Another Powerful Atmospheric River Slams the State,"Yet another atmospheric river.

It arrived late Monday, flooding roads and setting off avalanche warnings in the state. Strong wind gusts accompanied the rain, knocking out power for more than 350,000 customers.

Already, a number of powerful storms this winter have severely stressed our state’s infrastructure. In coastal Monterey County, more than 1,500 people were ordered to evacuate over the weekend in Pajaro, a small agricultural community, after a river levee was breached by flooding. In the Sierra Nevada and San Bernardino mountains, sky-high piles of snow have closed roads and collapsed roofs.

But despite the mounting damage from this especially ferocious winter, water experts are warning that the spring could be even more challenging, my colleagues Tim Arango and Shawn Hubler report.

The cumulative impact of the recent back-to-back storms has left California in “uncharted territory,” particularly in the Southern Sierra Nevada, where the water content of the snowpack is the largest ever recorded, said Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow specializing in water at the Public Policy Institute of California. Low-lying communities could be at risk of flooding as the snowpack melts and dam managers are forced to release water, he said.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.7689,[],['San Bernardino']

Then came record rainfall early Tuesday, drenching parts of St. Louis and other areas of Missouri with up to a foot of rain that quickly transformed interstates and neighborhood streets into roaring rivers that collapsed roofs and forced residents to flee their homes in inflatable boats.

While officials worked to assess the full scope of the damage, Chief Dennis M. Jenkerson of the St. Louis Fire Department said at a news conference on Tuesday that one person who had been pulled from a flooded vehicle had died. There was about 8.5 feet of water in the area, he said.

Firefighters had helped or rescued about 70 residents, he said. Property damage was “very significant” in some hard-hit areas, he said, including one in the southwestern part of the city where 14 or 15 homes had experienced “significant flooding.”",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,natural disaster,0,0,1,-0.959,[],['Missouri']
1786,2023-04-28,Looking for a Climate Career? They Might Have the Answer.,"Each issue of the newsletter is written by M.B.A. students from elite schools: Stanford, Harvard, Yale, Columbia and the University of California, Berkeley.Kolman, Kossoff and Liu receive pitches. They vet the material with outside experts. They also write. They’re keen to help their readers distinguish between what actually makes a difference in bringing down emissions and what counts as greenwashing.

How did they get drawn into this project?

Liu grew up in Southern California. Daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, she saw on trips to China and Taiwan how farmland turned to skyscraper land. She became intrigued by land use changes, and then, gradually, by the links between climate change and sustainable food systems. She majored in international relations at the University of California, Irvine.

Kolman, who grew up in Savannah, Ga., majored in physics and political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “I spent my time in undergrad searching for a career where I could use my analytical skills to improve society,” he told me. A trip to South Africa, which has dealt with successive droughts exacerbated by climate change, brought home “the impacts of water insecurity.”

He considered working in public policy but those plans changed after the 2016 election. He worked for a consulting firm that helped its clients buy solar and wind energy for their operations. Then, business school.

Kossoff, who calls herself the “most recent climate convert,” grew up mostly in southwest Florida and studied business and chemistry at Emory University. There was no “Aha!” moment for her. “It was more of a slow realization that something was very, very wrong as I saw the places I loved most from my childhood changing,” she said.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,0.6581,"['China', 'South Africa', 'Taiwan, Province of China']","['Savannah', 'Berkeley', 'Columbia', 'Irvine', 'Florida']"
1787,2021-07-02,Going to the Beach? Here’s How to Check if It’s Polluted,"“We’ve always been dependent on our beaches as open space, as a place to relax,” she recently told me. “In 2020, they were open and available, and people were seeking out that connection to nature.”

Heal the Bay this week released its 31st annual Beach Report Card and its third River Report Card. The grades aim to help Californians better understand the water quality in the places where they may be swimming. The report assigns A through F letter grades based on bacterial pollution levels to some 500 beaches, almost all in California, and 28 freshwater recreation sites in Los Angeles County.

The findings paint a mixed picture of our drought-wracked summer. While the vast majority of beaches had excellent water quality in summer 2020, it was most likely because there was no rain to wash pollution into the sea.

“The first rain washes so much pollution in, and in what used to be our normal weather pattern, each one was less polluting than the last one,” Luce said. “Now there’s weeks or months before the next flush, so pollution builds up again.”

In other words, we’re facing more extreme fluctuations in water quality, which could then tip into dangerous levels of pollution more often.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,scientific report,0,0,0,0.6124,[],"['Los Angeles', 'Bay']"
1788,2023-11-18,I’m a Climate Scientist. I’m Not Screaming Into the Void Anymore.,"Two and a half years ago, when I was asked to help write the most authoritative report on climate change in the United States, I hesitated. Did we really need another warning of the dire consequences of climate change in this country? The answer, legally, was yes: Congress mandates that the National Climate Assessment be updated every four years or so. But after four previous assessments and six United Nations reports since 1990, I was skeptical that what we needed to address climate change was yet another report.

In the end, I said yes, but reluctantly. Frankly, I was sick of admonishing people about how bad things could get. Scientists have raised the alarm over and over again, and still the temperature rises. Extreme events like heat waves, floods and droughts are becoming more severe and frequent, exactly as we predicted they would. We were proved right. It didn’t seem to matter.

Our report, which was released on Tuesday, contains more dire warnings. There are plenty of new reasons for despair. Thanks to recent scientific advances, we can now link climate change to specific extreme weather disasters, and we have a better understanding of how the feedback loops in the climate system can make warming even worse. We can also now more confidently forecast catastrophic outcomes if global emissions continue on their current trajectory. But to me, the most surprising new finding in the Fifth National Climate Assessment is this: There has been genuine progress, too.

I’m used to mind-boggling numbers, and there are many of them in this report. Human beings have put about 1.6 trillion tons of carbon in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution — more than the weight of every living thing on Earth combined. But as we wrote the report, I learned other, even more mind-boggling numbers. In the last decade, the cost of wind energy has declined by 70 percent and solar has declined 90 percent. Renewables now make up 80 percent of new electricity generation capacity. Our country’s greenhouse gas emissions are falling, even as our G.D.P. and population grow.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,-0.9238,['United States'],[]

At least 162 people were dead after a powerful earthquake struck Java, Indonesia’s main island, yesterday. Hundreds more were injured. Officials expect the death toll to rise sharply — many people are trapped under damaged buildings or in landslides.

Damage from the 5.6-magnitude quake prevented many people from reaching the main hospital in ambulances. Instead, injured people reportedly arrived on motorbikes. Here’s a video of the damage.

The hospital itself was damaged and lost power. The government erected tents outside to treat injured people, and others were being treated in smaller hospitals nearby. “This is overwhelming,” a government official told reporters.

1790,2024-09-25,I’m a Chef. This Grain Should Be the Next Quinoa.,"In 1999, Ruth Reichl, then the editor in chief of Gourmet, asked me if I would travel around Ethiopia, the country of my birth, with a writer for the magazine. I hadn’t been back since my Swedish parents adopted me when I was about 2 years old, and when the plane touched down there, I was overcome with emotion.

Everything was both unfamiliar and yet so comfortable. My first time walking through the open-air market in the capital, Addis Ababa, the sights and smells of spices, herbs and grains overwhelmed me. I picked up a handful of millet and wondered how toasting it might bring out its earthiness, or how slow-cooking it in a rich broth could make it creamy like risotto. This was the start of a decades-long obsession with the foods of my ancestors and my attempts to bring them into my home and onto my menus.

In the years since my trip, climate change has made it far more difficult to grow food in many parts of Africa (and beyond). Months of heavy rain and flooding have battered East African farmland, while blazing heat and drought in southern Africa have left farmers with little to harvest.

But a handful of African grains are well suited to difficult planting conditions. Millet, sorghum and teff are delicious, nutritious and quick to grow, even after natural disasters. Pearl millet, a staple throughout sub-Saharan Africa, can grow in both waterlogged and barren soil. Teff is an ancient grain used in injera bread that provides up to two-thirds of Ethiopia’s protein and dietary fiber. It can regrow even after extreme drought. Fonio, a grain from West Africa, is part of the millet family. It’s rich in iron, B vitamins and calcium.

1791,2023-01-20,Leveling the (Green) Playing Field,"The Biden administration has two years left to make good on a big, bold promise to redress longstanding environmental harms suffered by poor communities of color in the United States and to help them prepare for the climate-changed era.

This is the essence of the administration’s environmental justice pledge. It acknowledges that pollution, driven by fossil fuels, has had an inequitable impact on disadvantaged communities in the United States. And it promises to widen access to public resources so that those communities can pivot to renewable energy.

With the Inflation Reduction Act, the White House has $370 billion at its disposal. How it distributes that money, and to whom, will be crucial in demonstrating the administration’s commitment to environmental justice.

“Part of this is also making sure we’ve got a level playing field,” said Heather McTeer Toney, a former mayor of Greenville, Miss., and a vice-president at the Environmental Defense Fund. “It’s a bit broader than addressing past injustices.

Then the sun comes out, the water recedes, and the neighbors go back to worrying about all of the obvious environmental hazards of living in a Southern California neighborhood bordered by three freeways and the Port of Long Beach: heat, drought, air quality and aging infrastructure.

1793,2023-11-20,What an El Niño Winter Could Mean for California,"Odds are that this winter’s going to be a wet one.

The intermittent climate phenomenon known as El Niño, which typically means more rain and snow for California, developed over the summer and is expected to intensify in the next few months. And this year’s El Niño is predicted to be an exceptionally strong one — maybe even ranking in the top five on record, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at U.C.L.A.

“This is likely to become an event that is historically significant,” Swain told reporters earlier this month. “All of California has elevated odds of a wetter-than-average winter.”

Of course, there are no guarantees. Experts emphasize that not every El Niño period is extra wet in the Golden State, and that the effects of the weather pattern often vary across the state (typically, El Niño’s effects are greater in dry Southern California than in the north).

“We’ve had wet years in California that are not El Niño, like last year,” Alex Hall, the director of the Center for Climate Science at U.C.L.A, told me. “And we’ve had dry years when El Niños are occurring.”",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,scientific report,0,0,0,0.5549,[],['Of']
1794,2022-11-07,Is California’s Fire Season Over?,"A prolonged dry period could follow these upcoming rainy weeks, as happened last year, which could allow fire danger to creep back up, experts say. And the risk of blazes in Southern California, while expected to be greatly diminished after this week’s storms, will remain higher than in the northern part of the state, as winter fires fueled by the Santa Ana winds are always more common there.

Still, these autumn rains are indisputably good news, particularly after predictions of drier-than-usual La Niña conditions over fall and winter. The storms will most likely yield significant benefits for both California’s ongoing water shortage and its fire season, especially in the cooler and wetter northern parts of the state, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

“In the short term, this is really one of the best forecasts you could hope for if you don’t like drought and extreme autumn wildfires,” Swain wrote on Friday. “The upcoming rain and mountain snowfall should deliver some much needed water to parched ecosystems, and effectively kill off fire season in northern and central California once and for all.”

As of Monday, the outlook from the National Interagency Fire Center shows little or no fire danger in all of the state except for a few inland swaths of Southern California, where the risk is considered low. Nowhere in the state is the risk of fires deemed moderate or high over the next seven days.

Already, we’ve seen far less fire devastation in 2022 than in recent years. About 362,351 acres of the state had burned through the end of October, compared with nearly 2.5 million by that point last year, according to Cal Fire.

1795,2024-11-17,"To Save More Water, American Homes Need Smaller Pipes","Many high-performing, water-saving fixtures and appliances are designed like straws, supplying only enough water to satisfy one’s thirst. But the pipes that bring that water into Americans’ homes are sized more like fire hoses.

Oversize plumbing pipes move water inefficiently, wasting money and increasing the risk of waterborne diseases. And water efficiency is especially important as climate change makes droughts more frequent and severe. Efforts to right-size plumbing pipes to match the intake of water-saving products are slowly gaining traction, but homeowners and designers of multiunit properties who want to use these more sustainable pipes need to demand them during the project design phase.

When the current method for sizing pipes to transport hot and cold water throughout the home was created in the 1940s, it was under the assumption that every fixture had to be able to support a line of people for the bathroom, like at a sports stadium at halftime, according to Christoph Lohr, a mechanical engineer specializing in plumbing systems and the vice president of technical services and research for the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials, a trade organization.

But even during a party at home, there won’t be a line for the kitchen sink, the shower, the bathtub, the laundry machine, the dishwasher and the toilets, with people using them over and over. In other words, most plumbing fixtures in the United States are designed to accommodate total flow rates far higher than they will realistically encounter.",,1,Drought_Glacial_Water,commentary,0,0,0,0.9499,['United States'],[]
1796,2021-04-19,"The Science of Climate Change Explained: Facts, Evidence and Proof","As a result, climate damages are hard to quantify. Moody’s Analytics estimates that even 2 degrees Celsius of warming will cost the world $69 trillion by 2100, and economists expect the toll to keep rising with the temperature. In a recent survey, economists estimated the cost would equal 5 percent of global G.D.P. at 3 degrees Celsius of warming (our trajectory under current policies) and 10 percent for 5 degrees Celsius. Other research indicates that, if current warming trends continue, global G.D.P. per capita will decrease between 7 percent and 23 percent by the end of the century — an economic blow equivalent to multiple coronavirus pandemics every year. And some fear these are vast underestimates.

Already, studies suggest that climate change has slashed incomes in the poorest countries by as much as 30 percent and reduced global agricultural productivity by 21 percent since 1961. Extreme weather events have also racked up a large bill. In 2020, in the United States alone, climate-related disasters like hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires caused nearly $100 billion in damages to businesses, property and infrastructure, compared to an average of $18 billion per year in the 1980s.

Given the steep price of inaction, many economists say that addressing climate change is a better deal. It’s like that old saying: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In this case, limiting warming will greatly reduce future damage and inequality caused by climate change. It will also produce so-called co-benefits, like saving one million lives every year by reducing air pollution, and millions more from eating healthier, climate-friendly diets. Some studies even find that meeting the Paris Agreement goals could create jobs and increase global G.D.P. And, of course, reining in climate change will spare many species and ecosystems upon which humans depend — and which many people believe to have their own innate value.

The challenge is that we need to reduce emissions now to avoid damages later, which requires big investments over the next few decades. And the longer we delay, the more we will pay to meet the Paris goals. One recent analysis found that reaching net-zero by 2050 would cost the U.S. almost twice as much if we waited until 2030 instead of acting now. But even if we miss the Paris target, the economics still make a strong case for climate action, because every additional degree of warming will cost us more — in dollars, and in lives.

A ‘critical’ risk on Monday

The central and southern Rocky Mountains are set to get strong westerly winds on Monday, driven by a weather system moving through the Plains. Wind gusts reaching 25 miles per hour are possible across southeastern Colorado, the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, eastern New Mexico and western Texas. Gusts of up to 50 miles per hour are possible in parts of eastern New Mexico and western Texas, where the National Weather Service has issued wind advisories. Low humidity levels are expected in the afternoon, especially across western Texas.

“Western portions of Texas are in exceptional drought,” Frank Pereira, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center, said. “The fact that you’ve got a dry cold front coming through with little to no moisture and strong winds means you’re adding more fuel to the fire.”",,0,Storm_Flood_Disaster,scientific report,0,0,0,0.8583,['Mexico'],"['Texas', 'Colorado', 'Oklahoma']"

Brian Paré, 38, pleaded guilty to lighting 14 fires in the Chibougamau area of Quebec between May and September 2023. Last year was Canada’s worst wildfire season on record, with a total of 45 million acres burned. On many days, smoke from the fires spread across North America and around the world, degrading air quality and disrupting the daily lives of millions of people.

Two of the fires Mr. Paré set forced people to evacuate about 500 homes in the town of Chapais at the end of May, according to a statement by the prosecutor, Marie-Philippe Charron, in court and reported by The Canadian Press. One of those, the Lake Cavan fire, burned more than 2,000 acres of forest and was the largest of the fires Mr. Paré admitted lighting. The court hearing took place Monday; sentencing is expected in April.",,4,Climate_Global_ExtremeWeather,commentary,0,0,0,-0.959,['Canada'],[]

Today: Record-breaking climate extremes are blanketing the United States this summer — from heat, to drought, to wildfires. Astead Herndon spoke with our colleagues, Sergio Olmos, about the historic heat wave that scorched the Pacific Northwest, and to Henry Fountain about how much climate change is to blame. It’s Wednesday, July 14.

astead herndon

Sergio, I feel like Portland has been basically at the center of every national news story recently.

sergio olmos

Well, we had a pretty extreme year in Portland. We had Covid shutdowns, 100 days of consecutive protests. Then we had historic wildfires where the sky just turned red. And then, finally, the city is starting to open back up again. Covid restrictions are starting to get lifted. People are starting to come out of their houses, go to restaurants, go to bars, and regular life was resuming a little bit. And then this massive heat wave just descends on the Pacific Northwest in late June.

archived recording The Northwest bracing for record-breaking and potentially life-threatening heat this weekend. Dozens of records, some of them decades-old are expected to fall —

sergio olmos

It’s Oregon, Washington and parts of Western Canada, and it brings this punishing heat.

archived recording 1 Portland hit an all-time record high of 112 earlier today. archived recording 2 Today in Portland, Oregon, temperatures soared to 114 degrees. archived recording 3 Portland hit 116 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday, making it one of the hottest places in the world.

sergio olmos

In Portland, we saw temperatures for three days in a row break record after record, and it finally got to 116 degrees.

archived recording This is some serious heat. Average temperatures this time of year — lower and middle 70s. We’re talking about —

sergio olmos

You know, 116 degrees is like 40 degrees above what it should normally be for this time of the year.

astead herndon

Wow.

sergio olmos

And that’s 9 degrees above the previous record of 107.

archived recording Many people that are not used to relying on air conditioning are needing to seek out cooling centers to stay safe.

sergio olmos

And so we see Portland thrown back into this state of emergency, right? Just like Covid or the protests, the wildfires — everything shuts down. No one’s outside. And this time, it’s a different catastrophe. It’s heat.

astead herndon

I know reporters have this weird experience, where people are staying in, and you run out. And I know that that is a reporter’s shared instinct. But can you describe what it was like over those last couple of weeks? What has it felt like, just physically being in that level of heat?

sergio olmos

Yeah it felt like, I walk out of the door, and the heat wave hits you. It’s like, OK. Feels like Vegas, right? But I’m in Portland. This is the Pacific Northwest, where it’s raining a lot of the time. It’s cool. It’s not a place you think of to buy an AC. It never gets that hot. We’re not used to this. 116-degree weather is something that — the health officer here for the county explained it that bodies acclimate to heat, but it takes time. You can’t just acclimate one day to the next, one week into the next. And so yeah, we’re not acclimated to that, and our infrastructure’s not built for it. For instance, I was driving around, and just a few blocks from my house, in the middle of the road, the pavement just buckled. It cracked, and it rose up. And the city said it was heat-related. I don’t know anything about pavement, Astead, but I assume it wasn’t —

astead herndon

I’ve never seen it buckle, so you’ve already got me shocked. [LAUGHS]

sergio olmos

Public transportation here, right? So the city, ahead of time, was like, hey, public transportation is gonna be free this weekend. If you need to get to a cooling center or anything, just get on there. Don’t worry about paying for it. But as soon as the heat hit, the streetcars and the trains — they stopped them because the overhead wires for the light rail system were being strained. They were only designed to work in temperatures of up to 110 degrees. And the streetcars — the cables that power them were actually melting.

astead herndon

Wow.

sergio olmos

So the city of Portland paused all trains, all streetcars, at the time they needed them the most. So it was harder for some people just to get to the cooling centers. And there’s a socioeconomic aspect to all this. There’s a professor at Portland State University named Vivek Shandas, and he studies climate adaptation. And during the heat wave, he went around Portland with a thermometer. It’s not the kind you buy at the store. It’s a scientific-grade thermometer. And he took measurements of different parts of Portland, and he found that the wealthiest parts of Portland were, in some cases, 98, 99 degrees. Right? And then he went to the working class parts of Portland, parts of Portland where the highest concentration of people of color, historically, have been disinvested. So not a lot of sidewalk, not a lot of tree covers, a lot of it exposed to sun, and a lot of concrete that just absorbs the sun’s radiation. He found a reading of 121 degrees in the poorest neighborhoods in Portland.

[music]

And so if you look at that and look at the big picture here, the county released a map of where people died in the city. And in the poorest zip codes, the highest number of deaths occurred. And in the wealthiest zip codes, we had the lowest number of deaths occur.

astead herndon

And what do we know about the people who died? Who are there?

sergio olmos

Right now, at least 193 people have died across Oregon and Washington related to the heat. What we know is that many of the people who died were elderly, living alone, without air conditioning. Others were homeless, and others had underlying health conditions. For example, there’s a story of an 84-year-old woman in Washington state, Dorothy Galliano, who was found dead in her home. She lived alone and had no air conditioning. A friend said that she was found with the window cracked open and the TV on, and she just imagined that Dorothy was watching TV, dozed off and just didn’t wake up. Another woman, Debra Moore, was found collapsed on the sidewalk just a few steps from a house she was visiting. And the police said that she had serious, underlying health issues. You have the story of a houseless man, Joseph Wade Davis, who’s 64. And he had just this tent on the side of the road with PVC pipe and tarp. And he was just discovered dead at 10 a.m. So it’s a mix of people. Obviously, the most vulnerable, elderly who were living alone without AC, homeless folks — these are the highest number. But there are other people, healthy adults, who also died, and some of them died at work.

sergio olmos [SPEAKING SPANISH] speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH] sergio olmos [SPEAKING SPANISH] speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

Sebastian Francisco Perez — he was the first reported workplace fatality related to the heat. And he died in the Willamette Valley, where he lived and worked. And so I went there to learn more about him. And it’s like a farmland community there, where they grow a lot of fruit, trees and kind of the breadbasket of Oregon. And I eventually tracked down his brother-in-law and his nephew, and they were working in the field when I find them. And he tells me about Sebastian Francisco Perez.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

He came from Guatemala three months ago. He wanted to have children, but he couldn’t afford it in Guatemala. Lived just very austere conditions. They grew their food. They didn’t have any wages. Came here to try to get some money to start a family.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

And he owed a coyote — these are the people that help immigrants cross illegally — he owed them $8,000 for the crossing. Five to front, three after. And so he was desperate to work. And that Saturday, when it was extraordinarily hot — and a lot of farm workers could take the day off, took it.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

He asked to work.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

He was told by relatives, like, don’t do it. It’s too hot. He said, no, please. I need the money.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

That Saturday, he was moving irrigation lines in a field of trees, and his co-workers, other laborers, found him collapsed among the trees. And they called 911, but they couldn’t tell the operator where he was exactly. A lot of the laborers, a lot of them immigrants, they work from farm to farm, and they get brought in together. And they don’t necessarily know where they are all the time. So they called his nephew, and they said, hey, he’s collapsed on the ground. We don’t know what to do.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

He tells them, take him to the shade. I’m on my way.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

And —

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

sergio olmos

Unfortunately, they couldn’t resuscitate him. He died that day.

speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]

[music]

sergio olmos

So this heat wave was kind of an opening salvo to what’s going to be a catastrophic season. The west is currently in the midst of a historic drought. Another heat wave is already sweeping across California and the southwest, and fire season has already begun here in Oregon. And this is unprecedented. This is the earliest in the year that I’ve covered a wildfire season. There’s a fire right now burning in Oregon. It’s uncontained. It’s already burned 150,000 acres as of Monday. And nobody expected the season to begin this early or already have been this destructive.

astead herndon

So from one climate disaster to the next?

sergio olmos

Yeah.

[music]

astead herndon

Thank you, Sergio.

sergio olmos

Thank you, Astead.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

astead herndon

OK, Henry, I’ve been speaking with our colleague who has been reporting on the heat waves out in the West. There was the record-breaking one that happened in June in the Pacific Northwest and another that’s underway in California. The question that’s running in the back of my head is, how much of what we’re seeing is related to climate change?

henry fountain

Well, you know, that’s the question that journalists and others always ask after a heat wave or other kind of extreme weather event. And it’s really a central question. So right after the late June heat wave in the Pacific Northwest, in fact, there was actually a group of scientists trying to figure that very question out.

archived recording (friederike otto) Good morning, good afternoon. Thank you very much for joining.

henry fountain

This group is called World Weather Attribution, and they held a press conference on Zoom announcing their findings. It was led by Geert Jan van Oldenborgh and Friederike Otto.

archived recording (friederike otto) In our study, we focus on the hottest day of the year, which is what broke the records and what you will have heard in the news. So the question immediately arose, what is the role of climate change in this event?

henry fountain

They try to figure out a link, if it exists, between the world that’s warming and these extreme events, like this really, really bad heat wave. And they try to do it really quickly.

archived recording (friederike otto) We have done this study within a week, and everyone worked nights and weekends and really —

henry fountain

They think that getting it out when it’s still fresh in people’s minds would help people understand the problem.

astead herndon

And how exactly do they do that analysis? How do they measure the impact of climate change when it comes to a single event?

henry fountain

They use a lot of computers, basically, that run models of the world. They simulate the world. And they run some models with the world as it is today, which is, it’s warmed about 2 degrees Fahrenheit because we’ve poured all this CO2 into the atmosphere. They also run models of a world that would exist if we hadn’t pumped all that CO2 in the atmosphere — in other words, a world without warming. And then they compare the two results. So for instance, if a heat wave like this had a 1 in 100 chance of occurring in any given year in a world that hadn’t warmed, and in a world that warmed it has a 1 in 10 chance of happening in a given year, then you know that climate change had an impact.

astead herndon

So when these scientists ran this model, what did they find?

henry fountain

Well, what you’ve got to understand about this heat wave — it was really off the charts. It was extraordinary.

archived recording (geert jan van oldenborgh) We’ve never seen a jump in record temperature like the one in this heat wave, as far as I can remember.

henry fountain

And when they ran the analysis, the results were clear.

archived recording (friederike otto) There is absolutely no doubt that climate change played a key role here.

henry fountain

This extreme heat wave in this place would have been impossible before we started warming the world.

archived recording (friederike otto) It means that, without the additional greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such an event just does never occur. Or if it occurs, it occurs once in a million times, which is the statistical equivalent of never.

henry fountain

So it was still a rare event, but 100 years ago, it was an impossible event. And that’s because the world has warmed.

archived recording (friederike otto) So heat waves are increasing in likelihood by orders of magnitude — more than any other type of extreme event.

henry fountain

And what these researchers have also found is that heat waves are more affected by climate change than any other extreme weather.

archived recording (friederike otto) So for any other type of extreme event, we do see extreme rainfall or droughts. We do see an increase maybe by a factor of four, but for heat waves, we see orders of magnitude. So this event was made at least 150 times more likely.

henry fountain

And she said that heat waves, more than any other type of climate-related natural disaster, are not only more likely, but they also tend to kill more people.

archived recording (friederike otto) And, yeah. And I think this is really — heat waves is how climate change kills us today. I think this is how climate change manifests most strongly.

henry fountain

Just think about it. A flood might affect a relatively small region, area near a river, whatever. But a heat wave can cover a huge amount of area. In this Pacific Northwest heat wave that ended in the end of June, everybody in Oregon, everybody in the state of Washington, and most of the people in British Columbia were affected. So I think the researchers estimated that that was something like nine million people, and that’s really a lot of potential victims of extreme heat. And so all of this has these scientists concerned.

archived recording (geert jan van oldenborgh) We feel that we do not understand heat waves as well as we thought we did.

henry fountain

You know, I’ve covered a bunch of these attribution studies, and I’ve talked to a lot of scientists about them. And normally, it’s pretty straightforward. But there’s one thing Dr. Van Oldenborgh said that really struck me, and I frankly I kind of found it alarming.

archived recording (geert jan van oldenborgh) I think most of us, or all of us, have just dialed down our certainty of how heat waves behave. We are much less certain about how the climate affects heat waves than we were two weeks ago.

henry fountain

Essentially, he said, like, after this heat wave, it was so unusual, so extreme, we’re not sure we really understand heat waves anymore. Like, it’s really kind of jolted us in our certainty of the way heat waves behave.

astead herndon

Henry, it sounds like what you’re saying is what really surprised you is the fact that the scientists themselves were surprised, and that they were saying the heat wave that was just experienced in the Northwest may have actually changed their understanding of how these operate. What exactly are we saying, though? How is this heat wave possibly different than ones that we have seen previously?

henry fountain

So what we’d expect with a kind of quote, unquote, “normal” heat wave is that, as the average baseline temperature goes up, you’d expect the hottest, record-breaking temperatures to go up at about the same rate more or less. But with this heat wave in the Pacific Northwest, the highest temperatures broke the record not by a couple of degrees, but by as many as 9 degrees. So the scientists are trying to figure out what’s going on here, and they say there’s really only two possibilities.

archived recording (geert jan van oldenborgh) The first one is the obvious one. It’s that it was just a really, really rare event, and this region was unlucky.

henry fountain

Maybe it’s just this confluence of bad luck, as they put it.

archived recording (geert jan van oldenborgh) I mean, the Earth is a really huge place, and weird things happen or very improbable happen somewhere on Earth on a fairly regular basis.

henry fountain

The Pacific Northwest had a heat wave that was compounded by the drought that’s been going on in the West, and the jet stream was acting funny or whatever, and maybe that’s the case. And in that case, maybe it’s not such a concern.

archived recording (geert jan van oldenborgh) The second possibility is that we could be past the threshold that made these kind of heat waves certainly much more likely.

henry fountain

But if it’s some other mechanism, some other threshold idea, that’s a concern. Maybe this one time of it now becomes once every five years or 10 years or once a year or whatever. So that’s the fundamental issue they’re trying to figure out. More and more, I think this heat wave is a big deal. It’s like a seminal event, really. Kind of like a big volcanic eruption or something, and it’s going to be studied for a long time because it was so unusual. And they’ve got to figure out why.

astead herndon

So what’s most alarming about their findings is that it could mean that we have hit a sort of tipping point.

henry fountain

It’s not necessarily that we’ve hit a tipping point. But the thing that really stuns a lot of climate scientists, and it certainly stuns a lot of people, is how fast things are happening. I’m guilty of this, too. I’ve been writing about climate change for a while, and it was always like, yeah, the big impacts are going to be in the middle of the century. Well, the big impacts are starting now. And it’s obvious now that the impacts are hitting us, but it seems like they’re sort of accelerating. So whether we’ve passed a tipping point or not, I don’t know. But we’re in a bad state right now where bad climate events are happening, and what we thought would happen in the future is happening now.

astead herndon

Hm. This makes me think back to the beginning of our conversation, when you were talking about all of those scientists who are rushing to get information out to the public after each of these extreme weather events. There seems to be an optimism at the core of that effort, a belief that, with a little more information, with a little more knowledge, that policymakers and the public will care more about this issue — will push people to do something. But I guess I’m wondering, is that true? Is this really a problem of lack of information?

henry fountain

Well, a couple of things. Scientists are scientists, right? They’re like men and women who believe in empirical thought and experimentation and getting data and analyzing it, and figuring out what’s going on and explaining it. If they’re optimistic, they think they’re going to do what they can do, which is explain the world — the way it is, the physical world, the warming world — to people. And then there are some scientists who then take that and use it to go out and directly influence the policy makers, like they go lobby Congress or whatever. But there’s a lot who just think, I’m going to do my job, and then it’s up to the public and the public’s elected officials to do their job and deal with it. And, you know, I think you’ve seen some of that. Scientists have gotten better about explaining what’s going on more quickly. And this whole attribution study by this group — I mean, that’s their goal. But what’s really going to change people’s minds is the more they’re personally affected by things like heat waves or floods or droughts, particularly if they keep happening or if, God forbid, they lose a loved one to a flood or to a heat wave.

astead herndon

I guess the “glass half full” read is that, as these things like heat waves become more tangible in people’s lives, then something will be done. But that same view also means that a lot of bad things are going to happen to people before they really come to know the bad effects of climate change. And we know that the people who are most likely to experience those negative effects are the people who are most vulnerable in our communities — the people who are most unheard, the people who have the least amount of political power to do something about it.

henry fountain

You know, sadly, I think that’s really true.

[music]

The poorest and most disadvantaged people in society tend to suffer the most from all kinds of climate-related disasters, and heat waves are really no exception. And what we’ve learned is that as the world continues to warm, heat waves are going to continue to increase in frequency and get hotter, and we may even see more events like this one in the Pacific Northwest with really off-the-charts, extreme heat. And that doesn’t bode well for all of society, but it’s especially bad news for the poorest and disadvantaged among us.

astead herndon

Thank you, Henry, for your time.

henry fountain

Well, thanks. Nice talking to you.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (joe biden) So hear me clearly. There’s an unfolding assault taking place in America today, an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections. An assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we are — who we are as Americans.

michael barbaro

In a speech delivered on Tuesday in Philadelphia, President Biden issued his most forceful denunciation to date of Republican efforts to restrict voting in states across the country and to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his victory.

archived recording (joe biden) Bullies and merchants of fear, peddlers of lies are threatening the very foundation of our country.

michael barbaro

The speech was designed to reassure Democrats, who say Biden has failed to deliver on a promise to make voting rights a central theme of his presidency. And it comes as Republican lawmakers in Texas try to adopt voting restrictions over the objections of their Democratic colleagues, many of whom have fled the state to block the legislation.

archived recording (joe biden) I’ll be asking my Republican friends in Congress and states and cities and counties to stand up for God’s sake and help prevent this concerted effort to undermine our election and the sacred right to vote. [APPLAUSE] Have you no shame?
