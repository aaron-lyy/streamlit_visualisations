disaster,Kite Confiscated After Coming in Contact With a Jet Near Washington,2025-03-30,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/us/kite-plane-ronald-reagan-airport.html,Washington,"Gravelly Point is a part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway and is overseen by the National Park Service. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.

Kite flying is barred at the park because of the low-flying aircraft in the area. Officers “briefly confiscated” a kite on Saturday, Ms. McGee said.

“That kite was returned to its owner shortly later, and no charges were filed,” Ms. McGee said.

It was not immediately known how high the kite was flying or what kind of kite was confiscated. The Federal Aviation Administration said on Sunday that it did not have a report about the kite.

Jamie Larounis, a travel industry analyst, said in an interview on Sunday that he had reported the kite to the airport police after seeing it make contact with the plane on Saturday while he was walking home from the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington.

He stopped to sit at Gravelly Park for 10 to 15 minutes.

Storm-Battered Communities Are Paying a Price.,2025-03-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/musk-fema-immigrations-doge-freeze-aid.html,North Carolina,"Ms. Noem’s office has directed staff to develop a plan to disband the agency, according to a person familiar with internal deliberations who was not authorized to discuss the matter in public.

It is not clear what government agencies, if any, would take over FEMA’s role delivering aid to communities hit by disasters. Mr. Trump has mused about returning those duties to the states, or perhaps having the Defense Department carry more responsibility for responding to disasters.

In the short term, however, many communities that see FEMA grants as a lifeline are still waiting.

“There are projects beyond our ability to address on our own,” Damián J. Fernández, the president of Warren Wilson College, said earlier this month on a campus still covered in debris from the September storm, his voice breaking. “We have followed the rules. But the system is not working.”

One storm leads to another

FEMA’s existential crisis arguably began last fall, when Hurricane Helene killed more than 100 people in North Carolina and damaged more than 73,000 homes. The destruction was shocking, especially in a region not accustomed to hurricanes, and quickly became part of the presidential campaign.

Within a week of the hurricane reaching North Carolina, FEMA had provided more than $45 million in disaster relief and sent more than 1,500 personnel, according to the agency. But as survivors struggled to regain access to basic services, many concluded that FEMA was failing to do enough.",clear would happen femas role disaster relief agency criticized response hurricane katrina,North Carolina,,DUK,117.11000061035156,117.6500015258789,119.41000366210938,118.93000030517578,0.46110572343350503,1.495964397283352,1.9639680981732581,1.55409417243513

disaster,Why Airline Pilots Feel Pushed to Hide Their Mental Illness,2025-03-18,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/magazine/airline-pilot-mental-health.html,"the United States, Washington, V.A.","Pilots are taught early — by those who went before them, by those around them — that being honest with the F.A.A. about any aspect of their medical history can jeopardize their careers. Several years ago, an investigation by the Department of Veterans Affairs that cross-checked V.A. and F.A.A. databases revealed a wide discrepancy: Around 4,800 commercial and airline pilots were receiving V.A. disability benefits without reporting these medical issues to the F.A.A. While some of those pilots may have been fraudulently collecting benefits for nonexistent or exaggerated problems, others were found to have conditions that should have grounded them. Unreported health disorders can be deadly: A study of 202 fatal aviation accidents that occurred in the United States in 2015 found that in 5 percent of the cases, pilots had not disclosed the diagnoses or medications that were later implicated in the crash, most commonly including psychiatric drugs of some sort, whether taken by prescription or recreationally.

Every pilot I interviewed for this article knew of colleagues who had hidden their medical issues from the F.A.A.; some admitted to doing so themselves — several of whom told me that their supervisors had urged them not to report a health problem. And then there are the pilots who simply do not seek medical attention: A 2022 survey of pilots in the United States found that 56 percent of them reported having avoided health care in some way.

Because pilots are often reluctant to seek medical care or disclose health concerns, the number of those who are struggling with mental illness — a condition that is often easier to hide and harder to be open about than many other ailments — remains unknown. A 2016 survey of airline pilots found that nearly 13 percent of them met the criteria for a diagnosis of depression and more than 4 percent had suicidal thoughts in the preceding two weeks. The pandemic, which forced pilots into furloughs and, upon return, into facing more unruly passengers, probably made things worse, as it has for the general population. Almost half of Americans will experience mental illness at some point in their lifetime. There’s no reason to think pilots are spared. If anything, given their schedules, their irregular sleep and all the time they spend away from home and family, it would be little surprise if they don’t fare worse.

For more than half a century, the F.A.A. essentially barred anyone known to have a mental-health disorder from piloting a plane. Then in 2010, the F.A.A. began allowing pilots with depression or anxiety into the cockpit on a strict case-by-case basis if, after a monitoring period no shorter than 12 months that begins when they start one of four designated psychiatric medications, they are considered to be stable. Though the minimum monitoring period is now six months and the list of medications has since expanded to eight, many pilots are still withholding their symptoms, reluctant to seek help and go through the F.A.A.’s onerous certification process around mental health.

The hypothetical dangers of a system that makes pilots hesitant to disclose their mental-health symptoms became frighteningly real one Sunday evening in October 2023. Joseph Emerson, an off-duty captain for Alaska Airlines, was returning from a guys’ trip in rural Washington. To get home more quickly to his wife and two sons in the Bay Area, he took a jump seat in the cockpit — available only to those who, even if off-duty, are qualified to provide assistance in emergencies.",study 202 fatal aviation accidents occurred us 2015 found 5 percent cases pilots disclosed diagnoses medications later implicated crash 202 survey pilots,the United States,,TRV,265.1300048828125,260.5,261.32000732421875,262.260009765625,-1.746314938914199,0.3147820822336852,-1.437029943207586,-1.0824859745527626

It was in that cavernous building in southwestern South Korea that the families waited anxiously for news after Jeju Air Flight 7C2216 crash-landed on Dec. 29. Then there were tears and outbursts of anger as officials periodically read out the names of the dead, many identified by DNA tests.

Under the Trump administration’s so-called deferred resignation offer, more than 800 FEMA employees are leaving, according to several people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. They include the agency’s top lawyer and his deputy, as well as senior officials in charge of human resources, information technology and reducing the risk communities face from future disasters.

Elon Musk, the founder of the private space company, is one of the most influential people in the Oval Office, and President Trump has endorsed his vision of sending humans to Mars.

But so far, it has not been a great year for the rocket company. The vehicle that is central to the Mars goal, SpaceX’s giant Starship rocket, has launched twice this year, and twice, it has blown up.

The latest explosion occurred on Thursday during the eighth test flight of Starship, less than two months after the seventh test flight also came apart in space. Again, a shower of debris rained down, creating a novel headache for travelers around Florida and the Caribbean who were unaccustomed to seeing “falling space debris” as the reason for flight delays. Neither incident injured anyone.

Explosions are not necessarily failures for a company that has thrived on a mind-set of “launch it, break it, fix it, launch again.” With innovations like landing and reusing rocket boosters, SpaceX has slashed the cost of sending stuff to space.

disaster,Medical Plane That Crashed in Philadelphia Lacked Cockpit Recorder,2025-03-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/ntsb-crash-philadelphia.html,"the United States, Philadelphia, Mexico","In the weeks after a medical transport plane crashed in northeast Philadelphia in January within a minute of takeoff, killing seven people, investigators had hoped that the plane’s cockpit voice recorder would contain clues to what had gone wrong.

But after the recorder was recovered from beneath eight feet of soil and debris, those hopes were dashed: The recorder did not record anything during the jet’s final, fatal flight. In fact, it “had likely not been recording audio for several years,” according to a preliminary report released on Thursday by the National Transportation Safety Board.

Jeff Guzzetti, a former accident investigator for the N.T.S.B. and the Federal Aviation Administration, said the finding was “shocking.” Federal rules for medical transport flights on planes registered in the United States require the use of cockpit voice recorders, though the plane in this case was registered in Mexico.

disaster,Trump Team Plans Deep Cuts at Office That Funds Recovery From Big Disasters,2025-02-20,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/climate/trump-cuts-hud-disaster-recovery.html,North Carolina,"As disasters have grown more frequent and severe, HUD’s disaster recovery program has become central to the country’s strategy for coping with climate change. During the 1990s, Congress typically gave the program a few hundred million dollars a year. Over the past decade, by contrast, Congress has often provided billions or even tens of billions annually.

HUD’s disaster recovery money also comes with fewer strings attached. The money is largely used to rebuild homes that were either uninsured or underinsured, which the Federal Emergency Management Agency does not pay for. It also goes toward rebuilding infrastructure that’s not covered by FEMA, like the private roads and bridges that were significantly damaged by Helene in North Carolina.

The money can also be used for job training, to help workers whose employers went out of business after a disaster.

Because state and local officials are often overwhelmed by a disaster, and because the influx of federal funds is large and quick, one of HUD’s main jobs is ensuring the money isn’t lost to waste, fraud or abuse. That includes tasks like helping state and local governments set up systems to avoid paying contractors twice, according to a former official who worked on the program. It can also mean more complicated tasks like coordinating HUD’s grants with other federal disaster programs.

Housing and Urban Development’s community planning and development office was already stretched thin, especially as large-scale disasters have become more frequent. On average, the HUD employees who manage disaster grants are each responsible for overseeing about $1 billion in grants, according to an official who worked in the office.",huds disaster recovery program become central countrys strategy coping climate change 1990s congress typically gave program hundred million dollars year past decade congress,North Carolina,,DUK,111.79000091552734,113.16000366210938,115.55000305175781,117.48999786376953,1.2255145678165402,2.1120531215117904,3.3634512080124814,5.098843278970286

Using a mix of archival and originally shot material, it wends between the past and the present to chart Spiegelman’s life, giving you a sense of both the man and the artist though without satisfying depth. His story begins in 1948, the year he was born, but more truly seems to have started when he was a boy in New York and accompanying his mother on errands. In a drugstore, he spied a copy of “Inside Mad,” a collection of Mad magazine work that featured a grotesque cartoon of a hyena-like woman by Basil Wolverton in the style of a Life magazine glamour girl. It was, Spiegelman says, “the cover that launched a thousand misbegotten thoughts and brains,” his obviously included.

The documentary fills in some of those thoughts through Spiegelman, who occasionally reads aloud from his work amid testimonials and a cursory history of comics. Early on, the married cartoon royals, Robert Crumb and Aline Kaminsky-Crumb (she died in 2022), share a meal with Spiegelman and his wife, Françoise Mouly. The first time that you see Mouly she’s prepping the meal in their kitchen and scarcely says anything. It isn’t until about a half-hour into the movie that she receives some serious face time. She deserves better: Mouly has been the art editor at The New Yorker for more than three decades and, as the documentary finally lays out, an important collaborator of her husband’s for even longer.

The documentary can be irksome, and its chronology a touch confusing, but Spiegelman is an entertaining interlocutor, and so are many of the artists and critics who testify to his greatness here. The cartoonists Joe Sacco and Chris Ware pop up, as do the comics scholar Hillary Chute and J. Hoberman, who’s a longtime friend and a Times contributor. I loved seeing an early cartoon that Spiegelman drew of Hoberman (they were at college together), along with a peek at the filmmakers Ken and Flo Jacobs. Everyone is engaging, the art is magnificent and the whole thing pleasant, if overly cozy and hagiographic. That’s too bad. Then again — with “Maus” and his other work — Spiegelman has already produced his definitive biography.

Officials were still marveling that all 80 people on board Delta Flight 4819 escaped death or life-threatening injuries after the jet made a rough landing and rolled over, grinding to a halt in a cloud of dense smoke, sparks and flames at Toronto Pearson International Airport.

“Every time you board a flight, you are greeted by flight attendants and by flight crew,” Deborah Flint, the president of the Greater Toronto Airports Authority, said at a news conference on Tuesday. “But we saw the most important role that they play in action yesterday. The crew of Delta Flight 4819 heroically led passengers to safety.”

As investigators from safety boards in Canada and the United States, as well as the regional jet’s manufacturer, began combing over the wreckage, there was no official word on what caused the crash. They are expected to look into a range of factors, according to aviation safety experts.

“Everything’s on the table: The wind, the pilot performance, the airplane, all those things will be looked at in detail,” said John Cox, a former airline pilot and founder of Safety Operating Systems, an aviation consulting firm.

The plane approached the runway on Monday in windy conditions that former pilots described as challenging.

For the 80 people on board the flight from Minneapolis, the world lurched immediately after the wheels hit the ground. In the blink of an eye, passengers found themselves hanging upside down, still strapped to their seats as jet fuel ran down the windows, said Pete Carlson, one of the passengers.

“The absolute initial feeling is just, ‘Need to get out of this,’” Mr. Carlson told CBC, the Canadian public broadcaster.

But after a horrific string of fatal aviation accidents over the past two months, this crash proved different.

The seatbelts that passengers had strapped on to prepare for landing probably contributed to the lack of a more catastrophic outcome, aviation experts said. Flight attendants and passengers were then able to help one another out of the emergency exits and, with the assistance of firefighters, onto the snowy runway.

Delta said that 21 passengers had been transported to local hospitals after the crash. By Tuesday morning, all but two had been released, the airline said.

Dianna Ertl, the mother of one of the passengers, said that her son, Mitch Ertl, 37, had been treated at a hospital and would be returning home to Minnesota on Tuesday. He had been on a business trip.

“My heart sank,” said Ms. Ertl, describing the phone call she got from her son.

Mr. Ertl told her that he had been one of the last people to exit the plane, and that he had needed to break a meal tray table that was blocking him from unbuckling his seatbelt, she said.

“I felt relieved that I was talking to him, that I knew he was walking,” Ms. Ertl said.

The crew of an air ambulance waiting to take off captured the moment of the crash-landing on video.

Mr. Duffy wrote on the social media platform X that following that meeting with Kelly Ortberg, the aerospace company’s chief executive, he planned to visit Boeing “to evaluate firsthand the measures being implemented to ensure its planes meet the highest safety standards.”

When asked about Mr. Duffy’s post, Boeing deferred comment to the Transportation Department.

During his confirmation hearing last month, Mr. Duffy said he would continue his department’s oversight of Boeing. The company came under an intense international spotlight during President Trump’s previous administration after a pair of Boeing Max plane crashes — a Lion Air flight in 2018 and an Ethiopian Airlines flight in 2019 — killed a total of 346 people.

The company was further thrust into crisis after a panel in the body of a 737 Max plane was blown out during an Alaska Airlines flight in January 2024.

In fact, Ms. Barger had confused the option to leave a tip on donations with a mandatory fee. Those tips are GoFundMe’s primary source of revenue and what allows it to be profitable, company officials say. But the tips, which can be adjusted from 0 to as high as 28 percent, are voluntary. The company also charges a 2.9 percent fee on all donations, as well as 30 cents for every transaction, which it says covers credit card and bank transaction fees. It also draws revenue from Classy, a subscription-based software company that helps clients including the World Central Kitchen and Salvation Army raise money. GoFundMe officials rushed to contact Ms. Barger’s office and straighten out the confusion, although not before multiple outlets published critical articles.

As it happened, Mr. Cadogan had been volunteering on a search-and-rescue team looking for dead bodies in Altadena when the controversy broke out, and he was oblivious to the public relations disaster. But the next day, he ran into Ms. Barger at a community meeting. “She gave me a massive hug,” he said, noting that since then Ms. Barger had been promoting the fund-raising site.

It was hardly the first time the site faced pushback. Over the years, it has been attacked for hosting campaigns by anti-vaccine activists as well as a fund-raiser by the men behind We Build the Wall, a charity that raised $25 million to build a border wall with Mexico but was later accused by prosecutors of illegally diverting that money for personal use. One of the founders of that group, Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former adviser, is set to face trial for fraud in New York next month.

Members of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, of which Mr. Cruz is chairman, received a closed-door briefing with the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board on the midair collision between an American Airlines commercial jet and a Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan National Airport that killed 67 people last week.

Senators, including Mr. Cruz, were updated on the investigation and told that the N.T.S.B. needed to collect valuable evidence from the helicopter still resting in the Potomac. The wreckage of the helicopter is expected to be recovered on Thursday.

disaster,What to Know About Collision Avoidance Systems on Planes,2025-01-31,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/business/washington-crash-tcas.html,"Calif., Cerritos","Years ago, Mr. Cox said, he was descending in a Boeing 737 over Orlando International Airport when the system alerted him and his co-pilot to traffic nearby. The pilots looked around for another aircraft, but saw nothing. Then, TCAS provided an urgent instruction: “Climb.” Mr. Cox said they did so and later saw a smaller aircraft beneath them. A collision would have been catastrophic, he said.

After a series of collisions, culminating in the 1986 crash of a passenger jet and smaller aircraft near Cerritos, Calif., that killed 82 people, Congress instructed the Federal Aviation Administration to require TCAS on all large commercial airplanes. It is optional on military aircraft, though, and it’s not clear if the Army helicopter involved in the crash on Wednesday was equipped with it.

That crash occurred at a relatively low altitude, though, where TCAS’s most critical collision avoidance instructions would have been limited by design, Mr. Cox and other safety experts said. As jets approach an airport, they are likely to be closer to each other than at higher altitudes. As a result, the system limits the alerts it issues to avoid causing confusion and hindering safety.

The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast

In recent years, the F.A.A. has required all passenger airlines and many other aircraft to use another system, called the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast. The technology broadcasts the location, altitude, speed and other data of aircraft it is installed on every second. Those broadcasts can be picked up by other aircraft or equipment on the ground.

Air traffic controllers and many passenger plane pilots rely on the information received from ADS-B systems using devices that can provide detailed maps of aircraft in an area. That information is useful in visualizing what is happening in the air, but the system typically does not issue the kind of alerts that TCAS does. Still, ADS-B is helpful to pilots, especially when they are flying in poor weather conditions or at times when visibility is low, said Dr. Hassan Shahidi, the president of the nonprofit Flight Safety Foundation.",series collisions congress instructed federal aviation administration require tcas large commercial airplanes optional military aircraft though clear army helicopter involved crash,Calif.,,PCG,15.666926383972168,15.626985549926758,15.13770580291748,15.157676696777344,-0.2549372676332422,-3.130992509374724,-3.3779477102547655,-3.2504760328471645

But the conditions on the moonless night of Jan. 29, when an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines passenger jet collided, were unusually challenging.

Many of the factors that contributed to the disaster are still being uncovered as investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board try to reconstruct the collision that killed 67 people. The midair crash, which caused wreckage from both aircraft to tumble into the icy Potomac River below, was the nation’s deadliest aviation accident since 2009.

Investigators have said the helicopter was flying about 100 feet higher than authorized in its designated portion of the airspace and are trying to determine why.

But interviews with helicopter pilots suggest that the Black Hawk was also dealing with a set of complex flying conditions, some of which are typical for the bustling area around National Airport outside Washington and some of which were unique to the series of events that happened last Wednesday.

One of the most alarming came last April, when a Southwest Airlines flight was instructed to cross the same runway that a JetBlue Airways plane was cleared by a controller to take off from. The JetBlue plane abruptly aborted its takeoff after a controller yelled at its pilots to stop. The jet came within 312 feet of the Southwest plane, according to a preliminary Federal Aviation Administration safety report and recordings that The Times reviewed. The safety report said that the controller who had cleared the Southwest plane had not coordinated with the controller directing the JetBlue plane.

The next month, an American Airlines jet was cleared to take off at the same time that a private plane was given permission to land on an intersecting runway, according to another preliminary safety report. As the American jet began speeding down the runway, the controller suddenly called off the takeoff. The jet exited the runway but the private plane had already touched down by the time it received instructions from the controller to abort its landing. The controller did not warn the pilots of either plane about the other aircraft, and the two fast-moving planes got within about 1,600 feet of each other.

Ms. Ellis is a Black Hawk pilot who has served for 15 years in the Virginia Army National Guard, according to a blog post she published Tuesday on Smerconish, an independent news website, which detailed her transition while in the armed forces. Ms. Ellis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Posts and reposts about Ms. Ellis surged Friday morning as thousands of accounts on X shared her photos and details online. The posts earned hundreds of thousands of views on the platform, according to a review by The New York Times and data from Tweet Binder, a company that collects data on the social network. “Jo Ellis” was the No. 2 most-trending topic in the United States on X late Friday morning with more than 90,000 posts, according to Trends24, a website that tracks trending topics.

By Friday afternoon, many of the posts shared Ms. Ellis’s video and emphasized that she was not involved in the crash.

disaster,"Before Crash, an Alarming Pattern of Near-Misses Between Planes",2025-01-31,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/plane-crash-near-misses-airlines.html,"Texas, Austin, the United States, New Mexico","A series of New York Times investigations in 2023 found an alarming pattern of close calls involving major airlines. Here are some of the key takeaways from those articles.

Near misses happen much more frequently than most people realize

In 2023, close calls involving commercial airlines occurred, on average, multiple times each week. The incidents often took place at or near major airports, and they were often but not always the result of errors by pilots or air traffic controllers, according to a Times analysis of internal Federal Aviation Administration records and federal safety reports.

In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2023, there were 503 air traffic control lapses that the F.A.A. preliminarily categorized as “significant,” 65 percent more than in the prior year. During that period, air traffic increased about 4 percent.

The biggest problem was a shortage of air traffic controllers

The vast majority of air traffic control towers in the United States — as many as 99 percent, by one measure — were understaffed in 2023, The Times found. The F.A.A. made up for those shortages by pushing controllers to work longer hours.

Controllers said in interviews and safety reports that they were being pushed to the brink. Some were experiencing mental health problems. Others were falling asleep on the job or showing up to work under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

“What happens when you stretch a rubber band too much?” one retired controller told The Times. “It breaks.”

Lousy working conditions contributed to problems

Controllers were not only working long hours; they were working in suboptimal conditions.

Elevator malfunctions forced employees to climb hundreds of stairs to reach control towers. Bees and biting flies harassed controllers who were directing traffic. Faulty air-conditioners left control rooms alternately broiling or freezing. One employee at a facility in Texas had to bring in lightbulbs from home.

Underinvestments in technology also increased the risks

The Times found that in 2017, after an increase in close calls and warnings from federal agencies, the National Transportation Safety Board called for the F.A.A. to install more systems that alert air traffic controllers to imminent collisions on or near runways.

Over the next six years, however, the F.A.A. did not install a single new ground-based system to warn about possible collisions. Only 43 of the nation’s more than 500 airports serving commercial flights had such systems as of August 2023. An F.A.A. spokesman told The Times that the agency did not have the funding for new systems but was looking for more affordable options.

In lieu of such technology, some controllers resorted to using a public flight-tracking website in lieu of radar.

In other cases — including in Austin, Texas, where two large planes nearly collided on a foggy winter morning in 2023 — a system that gauges the speed and direction of the wind was down for weeks, leaving controllers to rely on a windsock. In New Mexico and Southern California, controllers reported that the radio frequencies they used to communicate with pilots had cut out at dangerous moments. At other facilities, radar feeds that allow controllers to track planes in the sky failed and runway lights malfunctioned.",series new york times investigations 2023 found alarming pattern close calls involving major airlines incidents often took place near major airports biggest problem shortage air traffic controllers,Texas,,CNP,32.667808532714844,32.35980987548828,32.300193786621094,31.942520141601562,-0.9428200759721008,-0.18422879830435945,-1.1253119281803245,-2.2201929780105956
disaster,N.T.S.B. Investigates Washington Plane Crash: What to Know,2025-01-31,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/washington-dc-plane-crash-ntsb-investigation.html,"the United States, Washington, F.B.I.","Federal investigators have begun a sweeping probe for answers in the collision that sent two aircraft plunging into the Potomac River. Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety Board, an independent federal agency entrusted by Congress to examine serious transport-related accidents, including in civil aviation.

“We are going to conduct a thorough investigation of this entire tragedy, looking at the facts,” the agency’s chairwoman, Jennifer Homendy, said Thursday, a day after the crash involving an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter. All 67 people aboard the two aircraft were believed to have been killed.

Here’s how the investigation is expected to unfold.

Who makes up the N.T.S.B.?

The agency has five board members, each serving a five-year term. The members must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.

About 400 employees, including investigators, work for the agency. Since 1967, the N.T.S.B. has investigated more than 153,000 aviation accidents, according to its website.

It is collecting evidence at the crash site.

Representatives from the agency were at the site within hours of the Wednesday night collision near Reagan National Airport in Washington. On Thursday, as it became clear that no one had survived, dozens of investigators began collecting evidence from the scene.

Two “black boxes” — the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder — from the Bombardier CRJ700 plane operated by American Airlines were recovered and sent to an agency lab, the N.T.S.B. said. A senior Army official on Thursday urged caution in making assessments until the helicopter’s black box could also be recovered and analyzed. It was not known early Friday whether it had been retrieved.

“Right now we are going through the debris fields,” J. Todd Inman, a board member, said Thursday. While evidence needed to be verified, he said the accident involved a “very, quick rapid impact.”

Investigators will also gather evidence from other sources, including flight data and maintenance records, and will conduct interviews to understand what happened in the lead-up to the crash.

Investigators will look at ‘the human, the machine and the environment.’

The inquiry will probably pull in a wide range of industry groups, labor unions and aircraft manufacturers.

“As part of any investigation, we look at the human, the machine and the environment,” Ms. Homendy said.

Mr. Inman said that it would seek information from parties including PSA Airlines, which operated the Wednesday flight for American Airlines; GE Aerospace, an aircraft engine supplier; Sikorsky, the maker of the helicopter; the Federal Aviation Administration; labor unions representing air traffic controllers, pilots and flight attendants; and MHI RJ Aviation, which owns Bombardier’s CRJ aircraft program.

He said that some teams of investigators would examine the Bombardier plane’s accident history and operating systems, and its altitude and course before impact. Others will look at the Sikorsky helicopter and review air traffic control communications.

They will also study the actions of the people involved in the crash to determine if human error played a role.

“A loss of life in an aviation accident is very unusual in the United States,” Mr. Inman said. “Our mission is to understand not just what happened, but why it happened, and to recommend changes to prevent it from happening again.”

A preliminary report is expected within 30 days.

The N.T.S.B. typically shares a preliminary report that describes what probably caused an accident. A final report, which requires approval from the agency’s board or a director, is released later.

In all, its investigations into aviation accidents can take one to two years, according to the agency. Mr. Inman said the N.T.S.B. intended to have a preliminary report within 30 days, and that it was too soon to speculate on potential findings.

Five years later, when American Airlines Flight 587 fell out of the sky, President George W. Bush predicted that the “resilient and strong and courageous people” of New York would get through the tragedy. In 2009, after a Colgan Air plane crashed near Buffalo, President Barack Obama said that “tragic events such as these remind us of the fragility of life.”

And then there was President Trump. In the wake of this week’s midair collision near Washington, Mr. Trump was more than happy to jump to conclusions and pull the country apart rather than together. After declaring it to be an “hour of anguish for our nation,” Mr. Trump just five minutes later let anguish give way to aggression as he blamed diversity policies promoted by Mr. Obama and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for the crash, which killed 67 people.

Mr. Trump has never been like other presidents. He does not follow many of the rituals and traditions of his office. He practices the politics of division rather than unity. Where past presidents have sought to project a comforting, paternal presence for a stricken nation in moments of crisis, Mr. Trump’s instinct is to move quickly from grief to grievance.

The helicopter flew outside its approved flight path. The American Airlines pilots most likely did not see the helicopter close by as they made a turn toward the runway. And the air traffic controller, who was juggling two jobs at the same time, was unable to keep the helicopter and the plane separated.

An F.A.A. spokesman said the agency could not comment on the ongoing investigation, which is being led by the National Transportation Safety Board. Crash investigators will spend the next several months reviewing flight data, recordings from inside the cockpits, weather patterns, as well as interviewing controllers and others involved to try to figure out what went wrong.

But the catastrophe already appeared to confirm what pilots, air traffic controllers and safety experts had been warning for years: Growing holes in the aviation system could lead to the kind of crash that left 67 people dead in the Potomac River in Washington.",helicopter flew outside approved flight path american airlines pilots likely see helicopter close air traffic controller unable keep helicopter plane separated,Washington,,WY,30.744855880737305,30.4072208404541,30.53631591796875,29.93055534362793,-1.0981838444549124,0.4245540169290938,-0.6782922111507182,-2.6485749039388473

“Do you have C.R.J. in sight?” the controller asked, according to a radio traffic feed on LiveATC.net, a website broadcasts air traffic control communications. A helicopter pilot responded that he did and said he would use “visual separation” — meaning he would keep an eye on the aircraft and make sure he was staying a safe distance away.

But moments later, the helicopter and the incoming jet collided. The audio registers sounds of concern in the air traffic controller’s background. Someone on the channel asks the air traffic controllers, “Tower, did you see that?”

Shortly after, all takeoffs and landings were halted at the Washington, D.C., airport as emergency personnel rushed to the scene.

And then a few started taking off.

Joseph and Ivy Craig considered themselves among the lucky ones — “timing-wise,” Mr. Craig quickly added, to make clear there were more profound things to feel fortune about than making a flight in time. They were heading to Florida to see Mr. Craig’s father, and so far, it seemed to be unfolding as planned. “We’re right on that line,” said Mr. Craig, 29, pointing out that a number of flights departing just before theirs had been canceled.

The Craigs had been unsure how this day would go since late Wednesday night, when Mr. Craig’s father texted him about the crash.

While speculation ran rampant for several hours — “including from the president,” Mr. Craig muttered — the grim facts were clear soon enough. And their worries about whether they would make their own flight came into a perspective: “That’s kind of selfish,” Mr. Craig said. “Let’s reserve our feelings for the people whose family members were on the flight.”

Even if their trip to Florida were disrupted, there were worse things. They would get there, just maybe later than planned.

Mr. Trump cited no evidence that diversity programs had anything to do with the fatal accident, which killed 67 people, and even admitted when pressed that the investigation had only just begun.

Moments later, he blamed the pilots of the Army helicopter that appeared to fly into a passenger jet while it was on final approach to Reagan National Airport, across the river from the capital. But he quickly returned to the theme that diversity goals that he said were created by President Barack Obama and President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had created unsafe skies, implying that those moves had to have contributed to the disaster.

Mr. Trump’s instant focus on diversity reflected his instinct to frame major events through his political or ideological lens, whether the facts fit or not.

American Airlines Flight 5342, which was en route to Washington from Wichita, Kan., had originally been cleared by the National Airport traffic control tower to land on the airport’s main runway, called Runway 1, the person briefed on the events and the audio recordings revealed. But in the final moments of the flight, this person and these recordings also showed, the jet pilot was asked by air traffic control to instead make a circle landing on a separate, intersecting runway, Runway 33.

That decision, according to the person who was briefed on the event and two other people who are familiar with the airport’s air traffic, happens routinely when regional jets like the American Airlines aircraft are involved, and may have been made to help keep air traffic moving efficiently by not clogging the main runway. It nonetheless raised questions within the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday morning about congestion at National Airport, one of the nation’s busiest, the person briefed on the event added.

When it comes to make-believe disasters, our appetite is endless; yet we’re loath to anticipate real-world disasters until it is too late.

It’s a discrepancy that Dorian Lynskey explores in “Everything Must Go: The Stories We Tell About the End of the World,” which happened to land on my desk as wildfires were tearing through Los Angeles. Lynskey, whose previous book was a “biography” of George Orwell’s novel “1984,” charts the doomsday scenarios that have enthralled and terrified people through the centuries. But our current era also offers us an unrelenting stream of catastrophe from around the world; we can no longer find respite from actual bad news. “What is notable now is that apocalyptic angst has become a constant,” Lynskey writes. “All flow and no ebb.”

Lynskey, a British cultural journalist, has the kind of omnivorous sensibility essential for a project like this. He has immersed himself in pulpy sci-fi, gloomy poetry, the literary criticism of Susan Sontag and the Book of Revelation. He sometimes gets so excited about his cultural stockpile that he can get carried away, letting loose a barrage of examples when a bit more restraint would do; at 500 pages (endnotes included), this is a book that would have lost none of its erudition or energy had it been 25 percent shorter.

But Lynskey also happens to be a terrifically entertaining writer, with a requisite sense of gallows humor. The extremity of his subject provides plenty of absurdity to work with. Reflecting on how a Nobel Prize-winning scientist predicted that “On the Beach” (a 1959 film that takes place after a nuclear war) would be “the movie that saved the world,” he notes wryly: “It is amazing what people thought a novel or a movie could achieve.”",everything must go stories tell end world written dorian lynskey charts doomsday scenarios enthralled terrified people centuries 500 pages,Los Angeles,,TRV,238.185546875,245.71473693847656,240.5259552001953,248.0750732421875,3.1610608461595233,-2.111709620241641,0.9825987999278399,4.152026223647202

Of course it should be more expensive to insure a home in an area buffeted by disaster. But in practice, states vary widely in their willingness to allow insurance premiums to increase, with some making it far harder than others for insurers to raise prices. California is one of the most resistant, and until recently refused to let insurers raise premiums or reflect climate-catastrophe risks in their pricing.

Insurers doing business in such heavily regulated states, finding themselves unable to raise premiums when needed, wind up shifting some of the costs to homeowners who happen to live in states that are more accommodating to premium increases. That is, in part, how middle-class communities, such as Enid, Okla., can end up subsidizing the owners of million-dollar houses in Malibu. And under our current regulatory regime, that dynamic is only expected to strengthen as climate losses continue to cut into insurance companies’ bottom line.

The voices loudly criticizing California for its rigid control of insurance pricing are ignoring numerous similar examples from the rest of the country. In 2023, after the federal flood insurance program began to adjust its premiums to better reflect climate realities, 10 states across the political spectrum — including reliably red Louisiana, Florida and Texas and moderate blue Virginia — sued the program. And California isn’t the only state that failed to raise premiums to properly fund its FAIR plan, the state-sponsored insurer of last resort often relied on by those living in climate-vulnerable areas; Florida did as well.

Home insurance is just one way our financial system encourages Americans to move to flood-prone sections of Florida or parched, air-conditioning-dependent Arizona. The government mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which guarantee about 70 percent of mortgages on single-family homes, charge the same fees regardless of climate risk. Nobody intends to move into harm’s way. Many people settle in places like Texas because housing is generally more affordable. But that affordability is a mirage: Their mortgage and insurance risks are being subsidized by everyone else. This system, and the continual building in risky areas, portends ever-rising disaster losses.

We get why change is hard. Losing one’s home can be economically and emotionally devastating. Rising insurance premiums can stress homeowners who are already struggling. For households that have their entire life savings tied to their homes, hefty premiums combined with lower home values tied to the cost of insurance could even lead them to default on their mortgages.",theory insurance prices quantify risks living certain place practice states vary widely willingness allow insurance premiums increase california one resistant,California,,PCG,16.845191955566406,16.92507553100586,16.9849853515625,16.51567840576172,0.47422181741927855,0.3539707722242595,0.8298711962727129,-1.9561281977306377

The move was not unexpected. Mr. Trump has been railing against the W.H.O. since 2020, when he attacked the agency over its approach to the coronavirus pandemic and threatened to withhold United States funding from it. In July 2020, Mr. Trump took formal steps to withdraw from the agency.

The first step in Los Angeles, too, will involve removing the remnants of homes and belongings, a process that could take months as officials sort out the details of the arduous and environmentally sensitive process. Only when inspectors determine that the cleared lots are free of toxic materials can rebuilding begin.

After that, California’s web of state and local laws can make it tedious and expensive to obtain the permits needed to undertake new construction. The state’s Legislature has passed dozens of laws intended to make it easier and faster to build housing, but the system remains sclerotic.

The city of Los Angeles is worse than most: It takes over a year — 466 days — to obtain permits for a new single-family home there, compared with 187 days statewide, according to an analysis of permit data by the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley.

But disasters have a way of creating a sense of urgency.

Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order on Jan. 12 that suspends two of California’s most stringent environmental laws — the Coastal Act and the California Environmental Quality Act — for homes and businesses being rebuilt after the fires. Karen Bass, Los Angeles’s mayor, followed with her own order a day later that expedited permitting for recovery efforts, established a new task force for debris removal and accelerated the creation of more temporary housing for displaced families.

In a state where wildfires are becoming more frequent and destructive, this has become something of a playbook.

Mr. Davis’s ideas were shocking when the essay appeared, but the events of recent years have won a lot of people over to his way of thinking. After the 2021 Dixie fire in rural Northern California, a Los Angeles Times op-ed series raised the possibility of abandoning small fire-prone towns in favor of supposedly more defensible cities. Now, while wildfires burn across greater Los Angeles, some commentators are questioning the wisdom of rebuilding. Has the time come, they ask, for a “managed retreat” from wildfire?

We need a serious discussion of how to live with fire in this new era. Today’s wildfires make clear that “let it burn” is not a realistic or humane response to the destruction of homes and communities — in either urban or rural places. These wildfires also make clear that the prospect of large-scale retreat from fire risk is a fantasy. Instead, we need greater investment in preparing our buildings, and community-led experiments in new ways to protect neighborhoods.

As scholars, we have spent the past two years studying how managed retreat from wildfire might work. Known primarily as a response to floods, managed retreat typically involves government buyouts of individual properties and, sometimes, collective relocation from high-risk areas. While managed retreat is the focus of substantial research and government programs when it comes to flooding, there is scarce precedent for applying it in response to wildfires.

Before a jet takes off, pilots perform visual and other inspections for damage or other problems. Airline mechanics also conduct periodic checks. Often, a mechanic can troubleshoot a problem quickly, fixing it or safely patching it up until the issue can be addressed later. Serious problems can result in a long delay or cancellation.

In addition, every part of a plane, down to the nuts and bolts, is subjected to routine inspections, repair or replacement. Those checks are typically scheduled based on how many hours the plane has been used, the number of flights, time or some combination of those factors. These inspections are overseen by aviation authorities around the world, with many following the lead of regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration or its European Union counterpart.

When it comes to more intensive maintenance that might take a plane out of service for days or weeks, the world’s largest airlines perform much of that work on their own. Some, including Lufthansa and Delta Air Lines, even sell those services to others. But every airline outsources at least some work to the companies that make parts and planes, like Boeing and Airbus, or to third parties. Small carriers, especially, depend on the practice.

“If you look at the long tail of aircraft operators, the majority are very small, so it never made sense for them to invest the capital,” said Jonathan Berger, a founding partner of Alton Aviation, a consulting firm. “Outsourcing has been going on since the dawn of time.”

The Rise of Outsourcing

While it has always played a role in aviation, outsourcing accelerated in recent decades. In the United States, the share of spending on airline maintenance that was outsourced more than doubled from 1990 to 2011, rising from about 20 percent to more than 44 percent, according to a 2012 Congressional Research Service report.

As Los Angeles burned for days on end, horrifying the nation, scientists made an announcement on Friday that could help explain the deadly conflagration: 2024 was the hottest year in recorded history.

With temperatures rising around the globe and the oceans unusually warm, scientists are warning that the world has entered a dangerous new era of chaotic floods, storms and fires made worse by human-caused climate change.

The firestorms ravaging the country’s second-largest city are just the latest spasm of extreme weather that is growing more furious as well as more unpredictable. Wildfires are highly unusual in Southern California in January, which is supposed to be the rainy season. The same is true for cyclones in Appalachia, where Hurricanes Helene and Milton shocked the country when they tore through mountain communities in October.

Wildfires are burning hotter and moving faster. Storms are getting bigger and carrying more moisture. And soaring temperatures worldwide are leading to heat waves and drought, which can be devastating on their own and leave communities vulnerable to dangers like mudslides when heavy rains return.",scientists say 2024 hottest year recorded history scientists warn world entered dangerous new era chaotic floods storms fires made worse climate change,Los Angeles,,TRV,241.7808380126953,231.4829559326172,232.37930297851562,235.96461486816406,-4.259180406818429,0.3872194573838762,-3.8884533246948365,-2.4055765512012393
disaster,Economic Toll of Los Angeles Fires Goes Far Beyond Destroyed Homes,2025-01-15,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/business/economy/los-angeles-fires-economy.html,"Los Angeles, Altadena","On the other hand, several mitigating factors could lead to lower costs and a stronger rebound relative to other places. The cinema capital’s wealth and industrial diversity, along with other natural advantages from geography and weather, may allow Los Angeles to stave off a worst-case scenario.

Estimating the likely economic losses is tricky at this stage. The weather data company AccuWeather has offered a figure of $250 billion to $275 billion, though a Goldman Sachs report said it found the estimate high. (Declining to provide a breakdown because its methodology is “proprietary,” AccuWeather said it considered many factors including long-run health impacts as well as short-term losses in the value of public companies exposed to the disaster.)

Here are some elements to account for when thinking about the total cost of the fires.

Physical Wreckage

The most straightforward component of damage is the number of structures damaged or destroyed, currently about 12,000. That’s fewer than the 18,000 felled by the Camp fire in Northern California in 2018, but this is a different kind of house: Zillow values the average home in the Pacific Palisades ZIP code at $3.4 million; in Altadena’s ZIP code, it’s $1.3 million.

That’s what is driving early estimates of insured losses progressively higher, now reaching $30 billion, according to Wells Fargo. But insurance will neither make all homeowners whole nor pay the full cost of rebuilding. Carriers have dropped thousands of policies in the affected areas in recent years, and the state-backed insurer of last resort caps coverage at $3 million per residential property.

Then there’s the damage to commercial space. Although one landlord managed to protect an outdoor mall with privately hired water tankers, many other businesses were gutted.",estimating likely economic losses tricky stage weather data company acuweather offered figure 250 billion 275 billion cinema capitals wealth industrial diversity may allow los angeles st,Los Angeles,,TRV,235.96461486816406,239.002197265625,241.38246154785156,240.5259552001953,1.2873041998937285,0.9959173218734709,2.296042007279146,1.9330611645223668

The country is regarded as a model for how to turn poor air safety practices into some of the world’s best.

Three decades ago, South Korea had a dismal record of air safety. Its flagship airline, Korean Air, experienced several deadly crashes in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2001, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration downgraded South Korea’s air safety rating for failing to meet international standards.

Around the turn of the century, South Korea began an immense project to overhaul its aviation safety practices, drawing on the experiences of other countries including the United States. By 2008, South Korea had earned one of the world’s highest scores in a safety audit conducted by the International Civil Aviation Organization. At the time of the crash, it was considered one of the safest countries for flying.

Air safety experts cautioned that it was premature to speculate about what caused the crash on Dec. 29 of Jeju Air Flight 7C2216, in which 179 of the 181 people on board died.

It Could Cost Taxpayers Billions.,2024-12-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/business/economy/mortgages-climate-risk-fannie-freddie.html,"Louisiana, S.C., Charleston","One report has estimated that homes in places at risk of flooding were collectively overpriced by at least $187 billion; in some counties in Appalachia and coastal Louisiana, that amounts to more than 10 percent of the total property value. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office found that federally backed mortgages covered properties that were likely to sustain about $190 billion in flood damage over 30 years. That’s not counting the peril of wildfires or drought.

While banks are becoming more careful about extending credit in areas that might flood, and homeowners are responding to flood risk disclosures on property search websites, the government-sponsored enterprises do not formally take such risks into account when underwriting loans. Studies have found that banks are more likely to sell mortgages in risky areas to the secondary market, and to Fannie and Freddie specifically after hurricanes (a conclusion that economists funded by Fannie Mae have disputed).

Fannie and Freddie have generally relied on insurance to deal with climate risk management: Flood coverage is required in special flood hazard areas.

That has become a riskier gambit in recent years, however, as disasters have also hit places far beyond where federal flood maps say they’re supposed to. At the same time, extreme weather has driven up insurance costs nationwide. Recent research has found that those rising costs can drive homeowners into delinquency, even if the house avoids damage.

The plea agreement, reached in July, has been a flashpoint for controversy. It would have required Boeing to admit to deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration about critical safety issues tied to a flight control software implicated in both accidents. The crashes, a Lion Air flight in 2018 and an Ethiopian Airlines flight in 2019, killed a total of 346 people.

Judge Reed O’Connor, of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, raised concerns on several levels about how the agreement had been handled, including a question about the independent monitor who was to determine if Boeing was abiding by the terms of the agreement.

disaster,Republicans Would Regret Letting Elon Musk Ax Weather Forecasting,2024-12-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/opinion/doge-musk-ramaswamy-noaa.html,"the United States, Oklahoma, U.S.","The best-known part of NOAA, touching all of our daily lives, is the National Weather Service. This is where daily forecasts and timely warning of severe storms, hurricanes and blizzards come from. Using satellites, balloon launches, ships, aircraft and weather stations, NOAA and its offices around the country provide vital services like clockwork, free of charge — services that cannot be adequately replaced by the private sector in part because they wouldn’t necessarily be profitable.

For most of its history, NOAA has largely avoided politicization especially because weather forecasting has been seen as nonpartisan. Members of Congress from both parties are highly engaged in its work. Unfortunately, legislation introduced by Representative Frank Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma — a state with a lot of tornadoes — that would have helped NOAA to update its weather research and forecasting programs passed the House but languished in the Senate and is unlikely to move forward in this session of Congress. However, in 2025 there is another opportunity to improve the agency and its services to taxpayers and businesses.

While there are already multiple efforts at NOAA to improve weather modeling, observation collection and marine management, Congress has piled more responsibilities on the agency, and the funding has not kept up. NOAA is spread thin, with a backlog of maintenance and upgrades that will probably take years to get through without significantly more sustained budget support.

As we enter a new world of artificial intelligence, NOAA needs significantly more computational resources to improve weather models rapidly. Otherwise, the United States risks becoming more dependent on similar institutions in Europe. Plain and simple, NOAA weather modeling and climate analysis efforts do not have the funding in the current institutional structure to keep up with our European friends. And because the military relies on NOAA’s infrastructure, the risks of and damage from extreme weather and climate events are a national security concern as much as an economic one. With a bigger budget, NOAA could offer increased value for taxpayers and boost the entire U.S. economy. What would that look like?

First, we need to have a serious conversation about further upgrading the agency’s aging systems like radars; observations, including balloons and buoys; research aircraft; satellites; and supercomputers. There is also an opportunity to build a state-of-the-art weather and climate prediction capability for the nation. That would involve modernizing emergency communication systems for future disasters instead of reacting to the most recent one. Though accurate weather forecasts, combined with effective watches and warnings, have reduced human deaths from extreme weather, still too many Americans are seemingly caught off guard by weather disasters.

In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, Mr. Biden cited the devastation he saw firsthand as he toured states like Florida, South Carolina and Georgia after Hurricanes Helene and Milton tore through southeastern states this fall, causing billions of dollars in damage and claiming hundreds of lives. “Additional resources are critical to continue to support these communities,” he said.

“From rebuilding homes and reopening critical infrastructure, such as schools and roads, to supporting the nation’s farmers and ranchers and ensuring access to health care services, impacted communities await your response,” Mr. Biden wrote. “There can be no delay.”

Mr. Biden’s letter aims to ratchet up pressure to act on a Congress that has been reluctant to take up his other recent requests for disaster aid.

Over time, repeated events can worsen the impact of frightening experiences, just as they would for anyone else. “Instead of seeing each incident as something that builds your armor, view it instead as something that puts chinks in your armor,” she said.

While emergency workers, such as paramedics and police officers, are often offered alternative work environments where they can regain resiliency after traumatic incidents, Ms. Healy said, flight attendants don’t have that same recovery period protocol. “It’s get back on the plane or don’t.”

‘I wish I could say I’m much improved, but I’m not.’

For some, the trauma endures for years, on planes and off. On a flight from Boston to Chicago in 2016, the aircraft that Emma Lazaroff was on went dark. The pilot, over the intercom, urgently told flight attendants to take their seats, and the plane started shaking and loudly rattling. It took what felt like a nosedive. “We were thrown against our seats,” Ms. Lazaroff said. “Luggage was all over the cabin. Everyone thought we were going to die.” After about five minutes of chaos, the plane seemed to ascend, and the black sky outside the windows revealed a sunset. The flight landed safely.

Ms. Lazaroff, now 32, doesn’t know what caused the incident — the pilot didn’t tell passengers, and the airline wouldn’t tell her — but it has caused severe and lasting repercussions. Shortly after the flight, she started experiencing panic attacks, flashbacks, nightmares and nausea, which persist to this day. This year, she was finally diagnosed with PTSD; Xanax helps her fly. “I’m much more irritable generally,” Ms. Lazaroff said. “I have a very exaggerated startle response — if someone puts a cup down, it’ll make me shriek.”

Jacob Morton, 35, said a 2016 flight from St. Louis to Los Angeles was “burned in my brain.” A few minutes after takeoff, he heard what sounded like an explosion. With a background in aerospace engineering and a previous job in aircraft design, he correctly guessed that the plane had hit a bird, which he knew was a benign occurrence that pilots are trained for. But when the engine stopped, and he smelled smoke, and the pilot instructed flight attendants to assume the brace position, everyone panicked — and so did he. “Ever since then, I just grip the seat and white-knuckle through every takeoff,” he said. He keeps an eye on speed and altitude, which provide comfort thanks to his knowledge of flight mechanics, but that’s all he can do. “I just grit my teeth and get through it,” he said.",flight attendants immune emotional trauma flights time repeated events worsen impact frightening experiences,Los Angeles,,TRV,260.3110656738281,259.07135009765625,261.600341796875,258.446533203125,-0.4762439018728649,0.9761757516859558,0.4952828723241248,-0.7162709222048206

His “refusal to provide climate finance will deepen the crisis,” Mr. Singh added, “endangering lives and livelihoods — especially in regions least responsible for, yet most impacted by, climate change.”

The question of what rich countries owe to poor countries has been a sticking point in international climate talks for years. Wealthy areas like the United States and Europe have historically pumped more heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the air than others by burning coal, oil and gas, while poorer countries, such as those in Africa, are more vulnerable to climate disasters.

Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, wealthy nations agreed to provide significantly more financial aid to developing nations. The vast majority of that aid, however, goes toward helping countries reduce their greenhouse gases, such as by building solar or wind farms.

But as global emissions keep rising and as the planet gets hotter, the necessity of adapting to heat waves, floods, sea level rise and other effects of climate change is getting more attention. Adaptation aid from wealthy nations and development banks jumped to $28 billion in 2022 from $21 billion in 2021.

Climate adaptation can include planting drought-resistant crops, raising buildings to avoid flood damage or moving communities away from coastlines. It might also include broader infrastructure improvements, such as paved roads or hospitals, that can make countries more resilient to a broad range of disasters.",question rich countries owe poor countries sticking point international climate talks wealthy areas like united states europe historically pumped heatraping greenhouse gases air others,the United States,,TRV,251.8611297607422,250.20486450195312,254.77696228027344,258.67462158203125,-0.6576105095543909,1.8273416815541659,1.1577143810564068,2.7052573883717597

She evacuated just before Hurricane Helene arrived, but her roommates, friends, co-workers and neighbors — people I knew, people I’d been to parties and trivia nights and potlucks with — did not. Soon there was no word from them. Texts and calls went unanswered. Social media pages showed the earliest impacts of the storm — falling branches, ominously rising water — and then went quiet. At first, all we could find from my sister’s town, Spruce Pine, was a single photo, blurred with rain, that showed the downtown area entirely swallowed by the small river that usually flows placidly beside it. The mountain soils had already been saturated when the storm blustered in, its swirling clouds laden with some 40 trillion gallons of rain, and when the water fell earthward there was little that could stand in its way. Hillsides and light poles collapsed; trees lost their grip on the sodden earth and fell across phone and power lines. Sweet little burbling creeks, the sorts of places where salamanders and crawdads usually laze under rocks, rose up into monsters that swallowed houses and erased roadways. The region’s residents were cut off — from one another, and from the outside world.

Stuck on the outside, we started sending one another images and videos, whatever scattered scraps of digital information we could find. We searched for familiar landmarks and place names, trying to guess what some crumb of nearby news meant about the places and people from which no news was coming. There was a woman in the next town who posted a video of waterfalls cascading over the broken slabs of what used to be her access road. On a Facebook page for Spruce Pine residents, suddenly the only activity was from people like us: people who weren’t actually there. Person after person begged for any news of friends and relatives, until finally the number of posts grew so overwhelming that it was clear the problem needed to be corralled into spreadsheets. Several versions appeared, with columns for residents’ names and addresses and one for the vulnerabilities that made those who couldn’t contact them especially frightened: the people who were elderly and living alone, who needed oxygen tanks or dialysis, the ones whose houses were in bad condition already and located very close to a creek.

The spreadsheets went on for name after name, hundreds of them. Next to nearly every one was a little status box marked “Unknown.”

Eventually, once some people had time to start chainsawing out of wherever they’d been trapped — once they found the remaining roads or paths that could take them to the few scattered places that still had cellular service — videos began trickling, and then flooding, out of the mountains.",sister lives western north carolina hours childhood home east tennessee evacuated hurricane helene arrived roommates friends coworkers neighbors soon,North Carolina,,DUK,117.65912628173828,118.33634948730469,116.8150634765625,113.13453674316406,0.5755806854665699,-1.2855610447112815,-0.7173798003179521,-3.845506661115224

But being proactive about that is extremely difficult.”

In basic terms, eastern Spain was flooded this week because of a cutoff low: an area of low pressure that breaks away from the jet stream, the fast-moving current of wind that meanders west to east across the globe’s temperate regions.

When a cutoff low forms in the Gulf of Cádiz off southern Spain, it produces winds that blow warm, moist air from above the Mediterranean Sea toward the country’s eastern coast. This moisture-laden air hits the mountains and is pushed skyward, condensing into clouds that dump rain onto coastal areas including the province of Valencia.

Normally the jet stream would whisk such weather systems away relatively quickly. But because cutoff lows are detached from those winds, they can linger in place, blasting the same places with rain for days and days.",cutoff low area low pressure breaks away jet stream jet stream fastmoving current wind meanders across globe cutoff lows linger place blasting places,Spain,,ITX.MC,52.29999923706055,52.68000030517578,52.040000915527344,52.540000915527344,0.7265794907430133,-1.214881142636512,-0.49712872911279987,0.45889422938409563

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, is also waiting for estimates from agencies on the ground, a spokeswoman said.

Homeowners can get loans of up to $500,000 to repair or replace damaged or destroyed real estate. Homeowners and renters are also eligible for up to $100,000 to repair or replace personal property.

Whether you were born into this changed planet or, like me, have seen it degenerate before your very eyes, there’s plenty to fret about.

And yet, two out of every three Americans say they “rarely” or “never” discuss global warming with family and friends. That must change. My connection and level of comfort with the audience allowed me to show my emotions without fear of judgment. It might sound corny, but it was like I was speaking to family and friends. If I can do it over the airwaves, shouldn’t everyone be able to do it at the kitchen table?

If we can have more conversations about climate change and how it’s making us feel, we can share the burden and prioritize action.

Action on climate isn’t just what you can do on your own but also what you can do with others. If your neighborhood or school can switch to renewable energy, heat pumps and electric vehicles to lower their carbon footprint, it’s far more powerful than making those changes inside your household. One example is the 19-fold increase over the last five years in the size of the electric school bus fleet. Overall, the United States spent a record $248 billion in 2023 on the clean energy transition, more than triple what it was in 2018.

We must also look for more ways to scale community actions to the city, county, state and the nation.

disaster,The Lessons of the Texas Power Disaster,2021-02-20,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/opinion/texas-power-energy.html,"Texas, California, America","Both sides have elided an interesting piece of Texas history. The person who put wind power on the Texas map was a Republican named George W. Bush. As governor, in 1999, Mr. Bush signed a law deregulating the state’s power market, at which point Texas started building loads of wind turbines. Wind now supplies about a quarter of the state’s energy diet — natural gas is about twice that — and Texas is far and away the biggest supplier of wind energy in the country and among the biggest in the world.

But wind, which supplies a smaller fraction of power in wintertime, had little to do with this week’s disaster. The simple truth is that the state was not prepared for the Arctic blast. A few wind turbines froze up, but the main culprits were uninsulated power plants run by natural gas. In northern states, such plants are built indoors; in Texas, as in other Southern states, the boilers and turbines are left exposed to the elements.

There are two lessons here to be absorbed and acted on. First, the country’s energy systems must be robust enough to withstand whatever surprises climate change is likely to bring. There is little doubt that a warming climate turned California’s forests into tinderboxes, leading to last summer’s frightening wildfires. The scientific connection between climate change and extreme cold is not as well established, but it would be foolish to assume that it is not there. (The dominant hypothesis is that global warming has weakened the air currents that keep the polar vortex and its freezing winds in check.) As the Princeton energy expert Jesse Jenkins observes in a recent Times Op-Ed, we know that climate change increases the frequency of extreme heat waves, droughts, wildfires, heavy rains and coastal flooding. We also know the damage these events can cause. To this list we should now add deep freezes.

If building resilience is one imperative, another is making sure that America’s power systems, the grid in particular, are reconfigured to do the ambitious job Mr. Biden has in mind for them — to not just survive the effects of climate change but to lead the fight against it. Mr. Biden’s lofty goal is to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury and to eliminate fossil fuel emissions from the power sector by 2035. In the simplest terms, this will mean electrifying everything in sight: a huge increase in battery-powered cars and in charging stations to serve them; a big jump in the number of homes and buildings heated by electric heat pumps instead of oil and gas; and, crucially, a grid that delivers all this electricity from clean energy sources like wind and solar.",texas biggest supplier wind energy country among biggest world wind supplies quarter states energy diet,Texas,,CNP,19.304908752441406,18.62027359008789,18.719362258911133,18.746387481689453,-3.546430450063292,0.5321547416789297,-3.0331482061847193,-2.8931567505146556

Their conversation has been condensed and edited.

Frank Bruni: I’m here in North Carolina, but far from the devastation. You’ve been on my mind because I keep thinking back to Hurricane Sandy and to the teamwork and mutual respect that you and President Barack Obama demonstrated at the time. Helene, now Milton — this has been politicized in a way that I don’t recall from Sandy. And a lot of misinformation has been pushed by Donald Trump. What do you make of that and also — because you know this from experience — how much does that actually hurt the relief and rescue efforts?

Former Gov. Chris Christie: Well, unfortunately, I think it’s a natural extension of the reaction politically that I got within my own party from working with President Obama. I will tell you, Frank, that not only when I ran in 2016, but when I ran in 2024, I could not get by a week without hearing about, “Oh, you hugged Obama.” And now it’s 12 years later.

So there’s no question that inside my party in particular, there is no longer the water’s edge. Everything is politicized. And when you add to it not only Trump’s willingness but seeming inability to avoid lying about everything — the combination of the two are toxic to the political environment generally, but they are really toxic to the human environment in a disaster. Because people are so disoriented by what’s happened to them. They’ve lost their home. Some of them have lost loved ones. They’ve lost their business. They have no place to stay.

disaster,Niall Ferguson Examines Disasters of the Past and Disasters Still to Come,2021-05-04,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/04/books/review/niall-ferguson-doom.html,"the United States, Montana","If the book’s vast temporal scope leads it to resemble histories written in earlier times, its drive to pronounce on events in cultures spanning the globe and its heavy reliance on cutting-edge theories makes “Doom” very much a product of our moment. It belongs on the shelf next to recent ambitious and eclectic books by authors like Jared Diamond, Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Steven Pinker. What unites these writers is their disregard for traditional disciplinary boundaries and a determination to reach for synoptic knowledge of stupefyingly complex subjects.

The result, in Ferguson’s case, is a book containing some genuine wisdom, but also some perplexing lacunae. One of its concluding lessons for the current pandemic, for example, is that lockdowns, which do great economic damage, should be avoided in favor of more precisely targeted measures, among them the quarantining of superspreaders — people who interact with far more people than most and therefore play an outsize role in spreading disease.

That sounds reasonable. Yet 300 or so pages earlier, in a section of the book’s introduction titled “Confessions of a Superspreader,” Ferguson tells us he “first spoke and wrote publicly about the rising probability of a global pandemic” long before most Western journalists, in late January 2020, while he was in the midst of a round of travel that took him from the United States to Asia, Europe and then back to North America. His travels continued over the following weeks, despite his awareness of the risk and the fact that he was “ill for most of February, with a painful cough I could not shake off.” The globe-trotting finally came to an end on March 15, when Ferguson flew with his wife and two youngest children to Montana, where they would ride out the pandemic in rural isolation.

Since one of the central purposes of the book is to show his readers that “all disasters are at some level man-made,” one might have expected Ferguson to reflect, beyond a cleverly self-deprecating section title, on his own possible role in spreading Covid around the world. This is a book, after all, containing a chapter titled “The Fractal Geometry of Disaster,” about how “nested within a massive event like the collapse of an empire are multiple smaller but similar disasters, each one, at each scale, a microcosm of the whole.” Yet Ferguson’s own arguably irresponsible actions do not inform his analysis in any notable way.

This is probably a function of Ferguson’s preference for highlighting systemic, as opposed to individual, failures. Eschewing great man theories of history, Ferguson treats political leaders as “hubs” within complex networks of information. When those hubs communicate efficiently with one another, the results are good. But when communication breaks down or information is less than accurate, a cascade of failures ensues that makes a disaster far worse. Superspreaders are hubs, too, within social networks, though in their case the more connections they have with others, the worse, since those connections spread disease far and wide. Hence, Ferguson says, the need to build an institutional infrastructure that can disrupt social networks in times of emergency to halt contagion.",doom book containing genuine wisdom also perplexing lacunae one concluding lessons current pandemic lockdowns avoided yet fergusons arguably irresponsible,the United States,,TRV,144.1371612548828,145.92286682128906,146.62242126464844,141.52301025390625,1.2388932533842012,0.4794001506399374,1.7242326601471305,-1.8136551172628321

There, they blanket oceanside cliffs and rocky outcroppings, breeding in enormous colonies before flying back south for the winter.

But in May 2022, as many females were getting ready to lay their eggs, the birds began dying in droves. “Thousands of northern gannets started to wash up on our shores,” said Stephanie Avery-Gomm, a seabird biologist and research scientist at Environment and Climate Change Canada.

The culprit: a bird flu virus, known as H5N1, that had recently arrived in North America. Over the months that followed, the virus raced through the region, killing tens of thousands of northern gannets.

The carnage was “devastating,” Dr. Avery-Gomm said. “You have to harden your heart to work on this kind of scale of mortality.”

Since a new version of H5N1 emerged in 2020, scientists have become increasingly concerned that the virus might set off the next pandemic, infecting people around the globe. But for the world’s wild birds, the prospect of a deadly, uncontained outbreak is not theoretical. The virus has already decimated avian populations around the globe, with body counts that can sometimes be staggering: an estimated 24,000 Cape cormorants killed in South Africa, more than 57,000 pelicans reported dead in Peru.

“The scale of the mortalities is truly unprecedented,” said Johanna Harvey, an avian disease ecologist at the University of Maryland. “There’s nothing comparable historically.”

Wild birds are poorly monitored, and the true global toll remains unknown, as do the long-term consequences. But a few years into the avian outbreak, it is clear that the virus is an unwelcome new danger to animals that are already under intense threat from climate change, habitat loss, overfishing and other human activities.

“This disease isn’t being popped into a lovely, pristine, resilient ecosystem,” said Ruth Cromie, the coordinator of a United Nations task force on avian influenza and wildlife. “This is a disease that is adding pressures to species that are already really up against it.”

She added, “I feel like the worst isn’t done yet.”

Nearby, a search-and-rescue team clambered over debris.

Baumbach’s 10th feature film, “Marriage Story,” and Gerwig’s second, an adaptation of “Little Women,” were both radiating with acclaim, and the couple spent that December, January and February attending event after event. Everywhere they went, they shook hands and hugged and scrunched close together for group photos. They leaned in, nearer to people’s faces, to hear better in noisy rooms. They breathed in, breathed out. They dined indoors. Along the way, they were informed that the Chinese theatrical releases of their films were being pushed back, then canceled altogether.

After the Academy Awards — where “Marriage Story” and “Little Women” were each nominated six times — the actress Laura Dern, a close friend of Baumbach’s and Gerwig’s, who appeared in both films and won an Oscar for Baumbach’s, wanted them to join her on a vacation in Santa Barbara, Calif., to decompress. Baumbach, who by nature seems quite compressed, just wanted to fly back home to New York and sit around watching movies. But Gerwig persuaded him to go. One morning, Dern found Baumbach sitting by the pool with The New York Times open on his phone and a copy of Don DeLillo’s “White Noise” in his lap. Baumbach hadn’t read the book since he was a teenager, shortly after it came out in 1985, but picked it up again, on a whim, several weeks earlier. He’d been carrying the novel with him as he flew from place to place. “I remember it so specifically,” Dern said. Baumbach began to describe the book’s plot to her, “and then he read to me aloud this article about Covid, and he was like: ‘We are about to lock down. This is really happening.’”

“White Noise” is narrated by Jack Gladney, the head of the Hitler studies department at a small Midwestern college and the originator of Hitler studies as an academic discipline. (“You’ve established a wonderful thing here with Hitler,” an admiring colleague tells him.) Jack lives with his fourth wife, Babette, who teaches posture to seniors at a local church and reads National Enquirer-style tabloids to the blind, and four children from his and Babette’s six collective previous marriages. Their household is frenetic, cerebral and tender. Babette exercises and cooks frozen vegetables. The kids move through rooms in a whirl of rapid-fire chatter, incorrectly correcting one another’s facts, while the television, always on and internet-like, murmurs brand names, rumors and breaking news underneath their conversations: “A California think tank says the next world war may be fought over salt.”

Life is discombobulated but good — good enough that Jack and Babette don’t want it to end. They’re both afraid to die, each privately tormented by the same knowledge of mortality that everyone else seems to walk around effortlessly suppressing. They want to suppress it, too. “Let’s enjoy these aimless days while we can, I told myself, fearing some kind of deft acceleration,” Jack says, early in the book. But then, the deadpan absurdity of DeLillo’s novel inflates into mortal danger: A train derails and disgorges a cloud of toxic chemicals outside of town, what authorities label an “airborne toxic event.” The Gladneys must evacuate — frantically, haplessly — and Jack and Babette are knocked further off balance.

But I don’t think this is an anomaly. This is the new normal.

So should Californians be making a run for it?

California isn’t falling off the face of the earth, and California isn’t collapsing. The beauty, the diversity, the complexity, all of those things make us strong but also make us challenging.

Part of it is reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But it’s also being prepared. Those who understand that will best navigate a disaster. They’ve thought through their insurance.

Some claimed falsely that the record-smashing heat waves blistering parts of North America, Europe and Asia were normal, and that they had been sensationalized as part of a globalist hoax. Others made up tales that cloud-seeding airplanes or a nearby dam, rather than torrential rains, had caused the unusually intense flooding in northern Italy (and in places like Vermont and Rwanda).

The devastating wildfire on Maui this month produced especially ludicrous claims. Social media that racked up millions of views blamed the blaze on a “directed energy weapon” (the evidence: years-old footage not recorded in Hawaii). And as Florida braced this week for Hurricane Idalia, some people claimed incorrectly online that such storms are not affected by fossil fuel emissions.

The unfounded claims that now regularly follow natural disasters and dangerous weather, contradicting a preponderance of scientific evidence, can often seem frivolous and fantastical. They persist, however — attracting large audiences and frustrating climate experts, who say the world has little time to evade a global warming catastrophe.",natural disasters extreme environmental conditions became commonplace around world summer scientists pointed repeatedly shared driver climate changeconspiracy theorists pointed anything,Hawaii,,HE,13.319999694824219,13.630000114440918,14.020000457763672,12.399999618530273,2.327330530924537,2.861337784653064,5.255261103432712,-6.906907637929089

There were fire tornadoes in the American West; a slow-moving hurricane drowned northwest Florida; children in Silicon Valley breathed a bit of the foul air that children in the shanties of Delhi grow up with.

In other words, the year climate change took center stage as a problem that also affects the richest country in the world, not just low-lying islands of the Pacific and arid swaths of Africa.

It was also a year of big promises.

Two of the world’s three biggest economies, China and the European Union, pledged to act more quickly to cut their emissions of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. And climate change became an issue in the United States presidential race.

But a report released on Wednesday uses a different measure: Which parts of the country have suffered the greatest number of federally declared disasters?

That designation is reserved for disasters so severe, they overwhelm the ability of state and local officials to respond. The report finds that disasters like these have become alarmingly common.

During that same period, 29 states had, on average, at least one federally declared disaster a year somewhere within their borders. Five states have experienced at least 20 disasters since 2011.

Victims often wait years for help to get back into their homes because money for repairs moves so slowly. The longest to wait are often renters, who are more likely than homeowners to be people of color or to have low incomes.

“Disaster recovery is not equitable in this country,” said Priscilla Almodovar, president and chief executive officer of Enterprise Community Partners, a Washington-based housing nonprofit. “Renters are the hardest hit.”

To shorten that wait, Enterprise and Morgan Stanley said they will begin loaning money to owners of multifamily rental buildings to repair the damage to those complexes, making it quicker for renters to move back home.

The loans are to be paid back with interest using disaster money from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to Enterprise. The department provides the bulk of federal disaster recovery money through its Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery program.

Morgan Stanley declined an interview request.

The British journalist Adam Higginbotham wrote about Chernobyl in his 2019 book, “Midnight in Chernobyl.” Now he’s back, with a look at the American side of the ledger, in his new book, “Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster on the Edge of Space.” On this week’s episode, Higginbotham tells the host Gilbert Cruz why he was drawn to both disasters, and what the Challenger explosion revealed about weaknesses in America’s space program.

“There was certainly a lot of hubris and complacency that led into this accident,” Higginbotham says. “In complex decision-making processes like those leading to the Chernobyl accident and the Challenger disaster, those concerned with making the decisions start off with a series of extremely carefully governed and defined practices for what constitutes acceptable risk and normal behavior. And then gradually over time, they subtly and almost unconsciously expand what they deem to be acceptable without even realizing it. So months or years down the line, they’ve started to accept engineering standards, in the case of the shuttle disaster, that to an outsider coming in cold would be obviously extremely dangerous.”

Creating a disaster response command within the military would provide unity of action among the services to respond to emergencies like the present one; improve strategic planning for an array of other threats, including future pandemics and climate-linked natural disasters; and position resources we will need before we need them — like ventilators and hospital beds that health care providers are scrambling to secure.

It should be activated immediately as the Pentagon’s 12th unified combatant command.

We can no longer afford Pentagon sideshows, like the establishment of the Space Force as a sixth military branch or deployment of army troops to the Mexican border just before the 2018 congressional elections. The Trump administration is now following the lead of Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, who called for the Army Corps of Engineers to be mobilized to quickly build out additional hospital facilities and make use of mobile military field hospitals.

She was in the harried process of moving from a hotel to an apartment in the Marina del Rey section of Los Angeles because her family’s townhouse was destroyed in the Palisades fire. Her daughter, who will be 16 on Friday, was a sophomore at Palisades Charter High School, a beloved local institution of 2,900 students where “about 40 percent of the campus was damaged or destroyed,” the principal told The Los Angeles Times. Pali High is providing virtual instruction while school leaders try to find a temporary location for their students, who come from all over the city.

Kyle was especially furious and bereft because her daughter — like other Los Angeles high schoolers affected by the fire — has already had so much disruption to her young life. During Covid, Los Angeles schools stayed closed to in-person instruction longer than those of many other cities across the country. She talked about how much online learning harmed her daughter, a social butterfly, in fifth and sixth grade. “These kids suffered so much during that time period,” she said. I have heard this complaint from many parents over the past few years: California opened up hair salons and restaurants but kept schools closed, and that said everything about how the state values children and families.

“Just to have to do this again, it’s terrible,” Kyle said. “I mean, she’s traumatized from what we went through. We were stuck on the road for 45 minutes with fire on both sides of us trying to get out.” Even though her daughter was so happy at Pali — she was a cheerleader and had lots of friends — Kyle decided to enroll her at a public school in Manhattan Beach, where she will start next week. “She needs to be in school in person,” she told me.

School disruption from natural disasters is becoming more common because of climate change, and America is not ready for it. In 2023, Jonathan T. Overpeck, dean of the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan, told The Times, “Pretty much anywhere in the United States you’re going to have to be more careful about this and perhaps change how we run our schools in order to accommodate climate change.”",lz granderson parents angry childrens schools closed fire says disruption natural disasters becoming common climate change lz california opened hair salons restaurants kept schools,California,,PCG,15.936530113220215,15.766779899597168,15.666926383972168,15.577059745788574,-1.065164200845891,-0.6333158467414846,-1.6917341939096011,-2.255637612942108

It also agreed to pay a $487.2 million fine, the maximum allowed by law, and invested at least $455 million over the next three years to enhance its compliance and safety programs.

But in May, the Justice Department had determined Boeing violated the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement reached between the two entities to settle the Max crash. The determination stemmed from Boeing’s failure to create and maintain a program to detect and prevent violations of U.S. anti-fraud laws.

The company was placed on probation, supervised by the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas, for three years. As part of the probation, the Justice Department will appoint an independent compliance monitor to ensure that safety measures were implemented and followed, with annual reports submitted to the government.

The families expressed disappointment over the July plea deal, saying the Justice Department still hasn’t doing enough to hold Boeing accountable. On Oct. 11, the families will have a hearing in Texas where a judge will listen to their objections about the deal.

Those who lost relatives or loved ones in the crash have long called on federal prosecutors to pursue charges against Boeing’s executives.

The blackouts are caused by an aging fleet of coal-fired power stations that the dysfunctional state power company, Eskom, is struggling to keep online. Power cuts have been a part of life in South Africa for nearly 16 years, but the past several months have been the darkest yet.

From large industries to mom-and-pop stores, many businesses have closed or laid off workers in a country where one in three people is already jobless. With the outages driving up the cost of doing business, prices for everyday goods have shot up, as has the frustration of a populace losing faith in the government.

Then Came the Floods.,2022-09-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/07/opinion/environment/pakistan-climate-change-floods.html,Pakistan,"Sometimes a weather event is so extreme and so far-reaching, it can be hard to make sense of, particularly from a distance. A third of Pakistan has been submerged by flooding now for at least a week, leading to image after image and video after video of endless water where homes and roads were meant to be. More than a thousand people have died, with more than a million houses destroyed or damaged. More than 100 bridges have collapsed, and thousands of miles of roads have been damaged. Hundreds of thousands of farm animals have died, and as many as 73,000 women are expected to give birth over the next month without adequate medical support.

Almost certainly, the monsoon rains were made worse by climate change, in part because rapidly melting glaciers contributed, and soon after the most striking images began to circulate internationally, there were calls for climate reparations, with which the world’s rich would compensate the world’s poor for the ravages of warming. (Among those making that call was Pakistan’s outspoken climate minister, Sherry Rehman.) Others argued that flooding of this scale, in a country only very fractionally responsible for global warming, made clear the need for a loss-and-damage system — which is what climate advocates say is a more circumscribed approach to help channel support from the rich countries of the world to those suffering most from climate impacts.

But as with any disaster, climate alone does not tell the whole story, and as the flooding wore on, blame has been spread around more widely. In the Pakistani English-language newspaper Dawn, the columnist Arifa Noor outlined many of the country’s policy and preparation failures in the decade since devastating 2010 floods that killed almost 2,000 Pakistanis, caused billions of dollars in damage and at the time were “the worst natural disaster to date attributable to climate change,” according to ClimateWire. Now “Pakistan has been hit by another calamity, but this time around nature has been even more wrathful,” Noor wrote. “The problem is that climate change is also turning into an excuse,” she went on, adding that “the rains and their intensity are beyond our control; the havoc they wreak is not.”

As the flooding continued, Foreign Policy declared that “bad governance exacerbated Pakistan’s flooding,” listing some long-term mistakes: failing water infrastructure, deforestation, poor drainage systems and dangerous, unregulated construction. But there are immediate needs, as well, of course. “Pakistan is at its nadir of political stability,” the climate scientist Fahad Saeed of Climate Analytics wrote last week, citing the ouster, by a messy 13-party coalition, of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf national government, and the fact that the P.T.I. remains in power at the provincial level. “In a recently called all-parties conference, P.T.I. was not even invited,” he wrote, “a reflection of the political bitterness, even during the time of worst flooding of country’s history.”",third pakistan submerged flooding least week thousand people died million houses destroyed damaged,Pakistan,,PAK,15.175125122070312,15.072148323059082,15.053424835205078,14.407476425170898,-0.6785894559871777,-0.12422574043647508,-0.8019722136474289,-5.058598797205075

The United States runs a budget deficit, which means it does not take in enough money through taxes and other revenue to fund its operations. As a result, the country sells Treasury debt to finance its operations — using borrowed money to fund military salaries, retiree benefits and interest payments to bondholders who own U.S. debt.

But Congress limits the amount of money the federal government can borrow — what’s known as the “debt limit” — and the United States is hit the current cap of $31.4 trillion last week.

As a result, Treasury Secretary Janet L.

The tradition dates back to the first Earth Day in 1970, which led to the passage of landmark environmental legislation in the United States. It was a momentous event that helped create the modern environmental movement — one whose origins can be traced to the shores of California.

Here’s a little history: Americans in the 1960s were becoming increasingly aware of the ways their behavior could be harming the natural world.

But Mr. duSaint isn’t worried. He’s planning to live in a dome.

The 29-foot structure will be coated with aluminum shingles that reflect heat, and are also fire-resistant. Because the dome has less surface area than a rectangular house, it’s easier to insulate against heat or cold. And it can withstand high winds and heavy snowpack.

“The dome shell itself is basically impervious,” Mr. duSaint said.

As weather grows more extreme, geodesic domes and other resilient home designs are gaining new attention from more climate-conscious home buyers, and the architects and builders who cater to them.

But in places with high or even moderate disaster risk, the future savings on repairs or rebuilding are likely to be greater than the extra money spent to build in resilience features, Christopher told me.

“It’s possible to achieve a really significant degree of protection against disasters,” he said. “The toll doesn’t need to be nearly as high as it is.”

Most home buyers aren’t aware of how much these features may save them in the long run, or they are more worried about the initial price than they are about the cost of eventual repairs. So builders have shied away from adding features that buyers may not be willing to pay extra for.

But that picture could be shifting.

With insurers raising their rates or refusing to offer new coverage in California, homeowners may come to view resilient homes as a way to make their insurance more affordable, which could increase demand for the structures — and give homebuilders a way to market them, Christopher said. It’s also possible that building codes will get tougher over time and start to require at least some of these resilience technologies.

Fourteen years ago, a Harvard climate and energy expert, John Holdren, coined a kind of axiom for the three choices climate change posed for humanity: Mitigation — the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions — adaptation and suffering. “We’re going to do some of each,” he said. “The question is what the mix is going to be.”

For years, the policy conversation has rightfully been dominated by the first part of the equation, because, as he explained, “the more mitigation we do, the less adaptation will be required and the less suffering there will be.”

But nations delayed curbing their emissions for so long that global warming is now guaranteed to intensify in the next three decades. And that means that mitigation alone, while still as necessary as ever, is no longer sufficient to prevent suffering: As devastating as recent extreme weather events have been, scientists say the next 30 years will bring even more, hotter heat waves, longer and more intense droughts, and more episodes of catastrophic flooding.

In its 2018 National Climate Assessment, the federal government released a sweeping report of all the ways the United States would need to adapt. Here are just four, courtesy of The Times’s Brad Plumer:

Rethink how we farm: Intensifying drought and extreme heat jeopardizes both the yields of crops and the workers who harvest them. Farmers may have to use more precise irrigation techniques to conserve water, relocate production and invest in climate-controlled buildings.

Build for the future, not the past: The nation’s deteriorating infrastructure — its roads, sewer systems, public transportation, power plants and transmission lines — was built with historical weather conditions in mind, so it can’t just be repaired; it also has to be rebuilt or retrofitted for the weather of the future.

Enlist nature to help: Restoring degraded wetlands and expanding green space can protect cities and coasts from flooding, while planting more trees can reduce urban temperatures and protect people from deadly heat waves.

Expect the unexpected: Earth hasn’t warmed this quickly in tens of millions of years, long before humans even existed. Changes this rapid are likely to bring unpredictable dangers, and the more the world warms, the greater the risk of such surprises, some of which may be irreversible and self-reinforcing.

At the moment, however, there is no national plan for climate adaptation, just as there is no national plan for mitigation. Every year, the federal government spends about $46 billion on recovery from disasters — about seven times what it spends on resilience, as David G. Victor, Sadie Frank and Eric Gesick note in The Times. In many cases, recovery money is spent in ways that increase the risks and costs of climate change by inviting people to build and move into harm’s way.

Not long ago, when I heard that California officials were embarking on an ambitious, multiyear effort to study one of the worst natural disasters in the state’s history, I knew there would be a lot of interesting material to cover. There was just one wrinkle: The disaster hadn’t happened yet — it still hasn’t.

The California water authorities wanted to examine a much bigger and more powerful version of the rainstorms the state often gets in winter. The milder ones replenish water supplies. But the strong ones cause devastating flooding and debris flows. And the really strong ones, like those that have hit the Pacific Coast several times over the past millennium, can erase whole landscapes, turning valleys and plains into lakes.

As global warming increases the likelihood and the intensity of severe storms, the state’s Department of Water Resources wanted to know: What would a really big (yet plausible) storm look like today? How well would we handle it?

As a climate reporter for The New York Times, I had a pretty good idea of how to tell the first part of the story. The department was starting its study by commissioning two climate scientists to construct a detailed play-by-play of how a monthlong storm might unload its precipitation throughout the state. (And what a lot of precipitation it would be: nearly 16 inches, on average, across California, according to the scientists’ simulations, and much more in mountainous areas.)",california water authorities wanted examine much bigger powerful version rainstorms state often gets winter milder ones replenish water supplies strong ones cause devastating flooding debris flows,California,,PCG,11.940584182739258,12.438109397888184,12.418207168579102,12.487861633300781,4.166673987928704,-0.1600100841086118,3.9999968052674753,4.583338990672179

disaster,France Is Headed for Disaster,2024-07-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/opinion/france-elections-macron.html,France,"If the numbers are there, who would be prime minister? It would have to be a political figure who can work with the center-left, the center-right and the right. This sort of consensus personality is in short supply in French politics today. In any case, this would be only a temporary solution. Caretaker governments have little political legitimacy and cannot achieve much apart from passing budgets to keep the economy afloat. After a year — the earliest, constitutionally, the president can reuse his dissolution power — Mr. Macron would almost certainly have to dissolve the assembly and call another election. We’d be back to square one, though in an even more volatile environment.

All in all, the prospects for a national unity government do not look good. Although on Sunday Mr. Macron called for a “great democratic and republican union” to defeat National Rally, he has spent more time remonstrating with the left than with the far right: a surprising sense of priorities, one might think. By rejecting what he calls the “two extremes,” he hopes to lure back center-left voters to his centrist coalition. But Mr. Macron is deeply unpopular. By arguing that the left represents as much of a threat as the far right, he might also dissuade centrist voters from casting their votes for New Popular Front candidates in runoffs against National Rally candidates. Their abstention may facilitate the election of more far-right deputies.

They don’t need the help. Taking advantage of widespread disillusion and anger, National Rally — with a majority or not — is likely to emerge as the election’s winner. The party is now dominant in almost all categories of French society and in most regions of France. Only big cities are still resisting this immense wave. It is leading in all age groups except 18-to-24-year-olds, though it attracts considerable support from younger voters, too. It is strong among blue-collar and white-collar workers, employees and professionals. A novelty is that retired people, Mr. Macron’s most faithful constituency so far, significantly shifted to the far right in last month’s European elections.

This far-right victory, now so close, was way off when Mr. Macron was first elected in 2017. Marine Le Pen’s National Rally then had only eight deputies in the National Assembly, a far cry from the more than 200 it will win on Sunday. Mr. Macron promised that he would protect France from right-wing extremism. Yet since coming to power, he has borrowed from National Rally’s playbook, passing controversial legislation such as the so-called separatism bill in 2021, which effectively ostracized Muslims, and a hawkish immigration bill that was adopted last year, thanks to far-right support. Far from defeating the far right, Mr. Macron has prepared the ground for its success.

It’s fitting, in a way, that the main political casualty of this troubled period may be Mr. Macron himself. Whatever happens on Sunday, it is clear to everyone that his unnecessary gamble has failed dramatically and he is responsible for the political chaos to come. His authority, both nationally and internationally, will be greatly diminished and his presidency all but sunk. He will surely face increasing pressure to resign.",prospects national unity government look good writes frida ghitis numbers would prime minister would political figure work centerleft,France,,DG.PA,99.91262817382812,100.35822296142578,101.79403686523438,102.88327026367188,0.4459844523581242,1.4306888478490405,1.8830539500301928,2.9732398638092303
disaster,Is a 6-Week Abortion Ban a Disaster for DeSantis? Two Theories.,2023-04-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/19/upshot/desantis-abortion-ban.html,"California, Texas, New York, Georgia, Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida, Michigan","Theory No. 1: It’s about demographics.

Abortion is relatively unpopular in states where today’s Republicans successfully banned abortion, like Texas or Georgia. These states tend to be relatively religious states in the South. There aren’t many of the secular, white, college-educated liberal Democrats who could bring about a “Roevember” backlash.

There seems to be a lot to this theory. Not only does it explain many of the cases in question, but it also fits a broader pattern from last November: Democratic strength in the House vote was somewhat correlated with support for abortion (though big Democratic failures in New York and California stand out as obvious exceptions).

But this theory doesn’t quite explain everything. In particular, it doesn’t work outside the South, including in places like Ohio or Wisconsin, where we know the right to abortion is popular. That’s where it’s important to notice my qualifier: where today’s Republicans successfully banned abortion. If demographics are the predominant explanation, then the Republican resilience in the North must be because voters simply didn’t hold them responsible for banning abortion. Democrats could hope Republicans will pay a greater political cost when they unequivocally restrict abortion, like what Mr. DeSantis is doing now in Florida.

Theory No. 2: When abortion is the most important issue.

This is what I’ll call the salience theory: It takes a special set of circumstances for Democrats to make abortion the most important issue to voters, like a Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate who promises to represent the decisive vote to legalize abortion when an abortion case is pending before the court, or a Michigan referendum that explicitly decides the future of abortion in a state.

As with the demographics theory, the salience theory is also consistent with polling and the general story of the 2022 midterms. Only a sliver of voters said abortion was the most important issue, not because abortion rights wasn’t important to them but because there were lots of other genuinely important issues at stake — the economy and inflation, crime, guns, democracy, immigration, and so on. With so many other issues, it makes sense that abortion plays only a marginal role in vote choice unless a distinct set of circumstances focuses the electorate on abortion alone.",abortion relatively unpopular states todays republicans successfully banned abortion like texas georgia states tend relatively religious states south democrats could hope republicans pay greater political cost unequivocally,California,,PCG,16.816322326660156,16.80636978149414,16.82627296447754,16.965579986572266,-0.05918383920506282,0.11842642546943281,0.05917249695914387,0.8875761121412392

The Phinizys’ home will cost a little over $150 a square foot — roughly in line with the estimates they got to build a conventional home.

As Mr. Phinizy put it: “It’s not all dirt cheap, so to speak.”

Earth blocks also weigh up to 40 pounds each, Mr. Runge said, which makes them difficult to transport in large quantities. Because of the high labor costs and low material cost, this construction method is more widely used in disaster-prone places like Haiti and Mexico, where labor is less expensive than in the United States, and on higher-end homes, whose owners can afford to pay more for labor and hire pricey structural engineers to help with the additional permitting. (Local building codes don’t usually account for earth-block construction, so a structural engineer has to sign off on these projects.)

But while it’s still a niche market — there are maybe a couple hundred earth-block homes in the United States — Mr. Runge said he has seen demand grow in the past year or so, as lumber costs have increased and natural disasters have taken a toll on housing.

For the first three years that he owned the company, Mr. Runge said he had about one house under construction every year. But this year, his fourth, there are five homes in the works. “We’re selling them faster than we can make them now,” he said of the earth-block-making machines.

On the waterfront in Florida, Gene and Tammy Tener are confronting a different kind of challenge.

The Teners bought a house in Crystal River in 2010, because of the area’s natural beauty. “We’ve got manatees that come right up to our dock, and dolphins that come up to the sea wall,” said Mr. Tener, a mechanical engineer. “For me, it was a dream come true.”",compressed earth block homes laborintensive build may cheaper wodframe houses construction method widely used disasterprone places like haiti mexico labor less expensive,Florida,,ALCO,34.865638732910156,34.63382339477539,34.531822204589844,34.11454772949219,-0.6648819484151653,-0.2945132248983346,-0.9574370080454556,-2.1542442092391774

If a Category 4 or 5 storm came ashore near the south end of Galveston Island, it would cause the worst environmental disaster in United States history, and could deal another staggering blow to the U.S. economy and national security, because of the potential loss of military grade jet fuel production.

In its continuing studies to design protection for these facilities, the methodology used by the Army Corps of Engineers substantially restricts the size of storm to be used in the design of protection structures. This methodology is outdated, does not adequately address the environmental and economic risks associated with such storms and does not factor in climate change and its impact on storm intensity.

By contrast, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission accounts for extreme surges in its safety guidance for nuclear plants. The commission has been doing this since 2012, after the Fukushima disaster, when it issued a letter recommending that an estimation of low-risk surges be incorporated into the design and permitting of nuclear power plants.

The comparison of these policies with those currently used by the Army Corps of Engineers is revealing. The nuclear agency evaluates the hurricane surge for a plant near Bay City, Texas, and concludes that it would have to design for a surge of more than 30 feet above sea level.

By contrast, the coastal spine, a set of 14-foot-high barriers and a two-mile-wide gate structure designed by the Army Corps of Engineers to protect the Galveston Bay system (an area comparable to Bay City) is meant to protect against a 17-foot surge at the coast — insufficient for the surge generated by either a Category 4 or Category 5 storm. Indeed, with a category 5 storm, over 100 separate chemical plants or refining facilities would be flooded, assuming the construction of the $20 billion coastal spine federal project.",category 4 5 storm came ashore near south end galveston island would cause worst environmental disaster us history potential environmental economic damage associated inundation facilities,Texas,,CNP,17.56299591064453,17.731868743896484,17.838525772094727,17.776308059692383,0.9615263484153245,0.6014990847197353,1.5688090053201171,1.214554453768152

These hospitals are woefully unprepared for the influx of patients, adding to growing strain on our state’s health care system. Dr. Ross MacDonald, the chief physician for the Rikers Island jail complex, was not being hyperbolic when he wrote on Twitter recently: “A storm is coming.”

For this reason, we and a number of public health experts call on Mr. Cuomo to release as many people as possible from New York’s correctional facilities, and to ensure they have the medical and re-entry help they need when they return home.

Here are several actions Mr. Cuomo must take, in addition to ending money bail for most people charged with crimes:

First, the governor should grant compassionate release to elderly inmates, as well as those with health conditions that put them at higher risk, including people with chronic and co-morbid conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and those who are pregnant or have immune deficiencies. We know that older incarcerated people are both more vulnerable to the disease and present the lowest risk of reoffending.

Second, Mr. Cuomo should release the thousands of people currently incarcerated on noncriminal technical violations of their parole, like missing an appointment with a parole officer — except in the very few cases in which a technical violation involves a risk to public safety. There are some 4,000 people incarcerated in New York prisons for such non-crimes.

He is, however, ambitious and supremely cynical. So when he says things that sound stupid it’s worth asking why. And his recent statements on Covid-19 help us understand why so many Americans are still dying or getting severely ill from the disease.

The background here is Florida’s unfolding public health catastrophe.

We now have highly effective vaccines freely available to every American who is at least 12 years old. There has been a lot of hype about “breakthrough” infections associated with the Delta variant, but they remain rare, and serious illness among the vaccinated is rarer still. There is no good reason we should still be suffering severely from this pandemic.

But Florida is in the grip of a Covid surge worse than it experienced before the vaccines. More than 10,000 Floridians are hospitalized, around 10 times the number in New York, which has about as many residents; an average of 58 Florida residents are dying each day, compared with six in New York. And the Florida hospital system is under extreme stress.

There’s no mystery about why this has happened. At every stage of the pandemic DeSantis has effectively acted as an ally of the coronavirus, for example by issuing orders blocking businesses from requiring that their patrons show proof of vaccination and schools from requiring masks. More generally, he has helped create a state of mind in which vaccine skepticism flourishes and refusal to take precautions is normalized.",ron desantis governor florida isnt stupid ambitious supremely cynical recent statements covid19 help us understand many americans still dying getting severely ill,New York,,TRV,137.84713745117188,137.87489318847656,139.2078399658203,142.75303649902344,0.020135156825087586,0.9667799165737858,0.9871097360512289,3.55894154827069
disaster,How to Thrive in an Uncertain World,2024-01-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/13/opinion/uncertainty-anxiety-psychology.html,"Canada, n’t, Outaouais","Learning to contend with uncertainty won’t completely fix the problems of our day. But at the start of a new year rife with high-stakes unknowns, we should rethink our outdated notions of not knowing as weakness, and instead discover this mindset as a strength. The implications for taming today’s epidemic distress, divisions and stalemates are vast.

Studies of the pandemic era offer a starting illustration of the links between uncertainty and flourishing. Ohio State researchers have found that adults who scored high on a measure of “intolerance of uncertainty” were more likely to struggle with stress and anxiety during the pandemic. Akin to personality tests, uncertainty intolerance assessments gauge people’s tendency to see unknowns as a threat rather than a challenge. Individuals who eschew not knowing tend to yearn for predictability and engage in binary thinking. During the pandemic, higher levels of uncertainty intolerance were associated with more maladaptive coping responses, such as being in denial, disengaging from life and abusing substances, a British study found. In contrast, those who struggle less with uncertainty were more likely to accept the realities of the situation.

“Life is inherently uncertain, and if you have difficulty dealing with that, you will have difficulty dealing with life,” says Michel Dugas, a professor of psychology at the University of Quebec in Outaouais and a leader in the study of uncertainty and mental health.

Tolerating and even delighting in uncertainty doesn’t merely help us to accept life’s unpredictability; it also readies us to learn and adapt. Each day, the brain uses honed mental models about how the world works, which are used to process a shifting environment. When we meet something unexpected, a neural “prediction error” signals a mismatch between what we assumed would occur and what our senses tell us. Yet our uneasy sense of not knowing triggers a host of beneficial neural changes, including heightened attention, bolstered working memory and sensitivity to new information. The brain is preparing to update our knowledge of the world. Uncertainty offers the “opportunity for life to go in different directions,” says Stephanie Gorka of Ohio State University’s College of Medicine, “and that is exciting.”

This is why being open to uncertainty is critical for mental well-being. Pioneering work led by Dr. Dugas (who originated the term “intolerance of uncertainty”) and Nicholas Carleton of the University of Regina in Canada shows that being intolerant of uncertainty is associated with vulnerability to mental health challenges such as anxiety, eating disorders and depression. After more than two decades of spadework, they and their colleagues are beginning to effectively ameliorate such disorders by treating people’s fears of the unknown, or what Dr. Carleton calls the “one fear to rule them all.”",people eschew knowing tend yearn predictability engage binary thinking uncertainty offers opportunity life go different directions says stephanie gorka ohio state university,Canada,,IFC.TO,199.88526916503906,198.53921508789062,198.25636291503906,196.62747192382812,-0.673413344950919,-0.14246665210515094,-0.8149206076086891,-1.6298335814437008

The first is that no matter what we do at this stage, numerous hospitals in the United States will be overrun. Many people, including health care workers, will get sick and some will die. And the economy will tank. It’s too late to change any of this now.

In three to four weeks, there will be a major shortage of chemical reagents for coronavirus testing, the result of limited production capacity, compounded by the collapse of global supply chains when the epidemic closed down manufacturing in China for weeks.

The second hard truth is that at this stage, any public health response that counts on widespread testing in the United States is doomed to fail. No one planned on the whole world experiencing a health conflagration of this magnitude at once, with the need to test many millions of people at the same time. Political leaders and talking heads should stop proffering the widespread-testing option; it simply won’t be available.

Much better, instead, to immediately gear up for epidemic intelligence, based on techniques used for many decades. Among those is so-called illness surveillance, in which epidemiologists survey a sample of doctors’ offices in a given geographic region each day to learn how many patients sought care for illnesses with symptoms of fever, cough and muscle aches. The increasing or decreasing occurrence of patients with these symptoms provides a reliable estimate of influenza activity during the winter months — or now, the incidence of Covid-19.

A third hard truth is that shortages of personal protective equipment — particularly N-95 masks — for health care workers will only get worse in the United States as global need continues to rise precipitously. There is no point holding out the false hope that the Defense Production Act will save the residents of the United States. Not enough manufacturing activities can be converted to produce masks in a matter of weeks.

A spate of wildfires. Flooding in Hawaii. As the United States rushes into disaster season, federal officials now have an added crisis to worry about: How to stop tightly packed disaster-response shelters from becoming hot spots of coronavirus transmission.

The virus is forcing emergency managers to rethink long-held procedures for operating shelters like these in real time. That challenge comes as the nation’s crisis-response work force is already taxed by three years of brutal hurricanes, floods and wildfires, a trend that climate change promises to accelerate.

“All of these activities that we do during and after disasters are activities that require a lot of people to be in close proximity to each other,” said Samantha Montano, assistant professor of emergency management and disaster science at the University of Nebraska, Omaha. “And that is the exact opposite of what we need to do to keep people safe from Covid-19.”

Just over one-third of South Africa’s population is fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data — a high rate for Africa, though still well below that of many developed nations.

In a precursor to Monday’s announcement, Mr. Ramaphosa described a “new era” in South Africa’s response to Covid-19 in a speech last month, when he cited data showing that 60 percent of South Africans had acquired some level of immunity through vaccination, getting over an infection, or both.

South Africa’s government announced a state of disaster — akin to what many other countries call a state of emergency — on March 15, 2020, soon after the first known case of Covid was reported in the country. Early on, the restrictions included limits on the types of clothing and shoes — like sandals — that people could buy, a regulation intended to keep them from leaving their homes. The restrictions also included bans on the purchase of alcohol and cigarettes; violators could be arrested and fined.

Those restrictions were gradually eased, but limits on large gatherings remained, and masks were required throughout the state of disaster. Those and other remaining restrictions will now be phased out over the next 30 days. Indoor and outdoor venues that require patrons to show proof of vaccination or a negative test no more than 72 hours old will be allowed to admit up to 50 percent of capacity.

A year ago, an opinion article in The Washington Post about the flailing American response to the emerging Covid-19 disaster quoted Dennis S. Mileti, an expert on how to prepare for and react to catastrophic events.

“This might be the largest public information mess I’ve ever witnessed,” he said. “It just breaks my heart. We know how to do emergency planning better than anyone on Earth, and it’s not there.”

Wind and solar are now the cheapest sources of new generation in most of the world. By 2030, it is likely that few coal plants will be able to compete with clean energy. The difference in costs is so great now that in many cases, it makes more economic sense to invest in renewable power with storage and use a portion of the income to buy out coal contracts, decommission plants and compensate affected workers and others.

The 38 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have seen emissions from coal plants decline by an average of 6 percent annually since 2014, according to our calculations. However, those emission reductions have been overwhelmed by emission growth in emerging nations, which now account for 79 percent of the global total, again according to our calculations. China, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and South Africa are among the countries that have relied heavily on coal for economic development.

Many factors are stacked in coal’s favor. Political and business elites are often highly invested in coal. Coal also supports tens of millions of lives directly and indirectly, and these are often concentrated in politically important regions like West Virginia in the United States, Mpumalanga in South Africa and Odisha in India. Moving away from coal, therefore, must be just if it is to prove politically and socially sustainable. By that I mean the transition must create paths to a brighter future for affected workers and others. It cannot exacerbate existing inequities or create other ones.

Another complicating factor is that an estimated 93 percent of coal power capacity worldwide is insulated from market competition by long-term contracts that guarantee the purchase of electricity at generous rates, according to the Rocky Mountain Institute. Building a grid around renewables also presents a daunting array of technical challenges. And emerging economies, with some justification, continue to place the onus on rich countries to lead the decarbonization charge and are highly resistant to outside pressure to phase down coal use.

And then, there’s the money: Federal watchdogs have begun warning, with increasing urgency, that the nation’s disaster spending is not sustainable.

The additional pressure of the pandemic has focused new attention on why disasters are so damaging in the United States: Underfunded emergency and public health agencies, weak home construction standards that make evacuation so frequently necessary, and racial and income disparities that put some communities at greater risk. But the growing toll of disasters might also generate the pressure required to address those problems, experts say.

“We have got to use this as a politically neutral, unifying effort to instill resilience,” said Brock Long, who ran FEMA until last year. “If we don’t make holistic changes in the emergency management and public health industries, as a result of going through ’17, ’18 and now Covid-19, then we are learning nothing.”

It also comes after Dr. Fauci, in an interview with “60 Minutes” that aired on Sunday, dismissed the president’s claim that the end of the pandemic was just around the corner. Dr. Fauci said during the interview that he was not surprised that Mr. Trump had contracted the virus, citing the failure to take basic precautions at White House events, including the announcement last month of Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court.

“I was worried that he was going to get sick when I saw him in a completely precarious situation of crowded, no separation between people, and almost nobody wearing a mask,” Dr. Fauci said. “When I saw that on TV, I said, ‘Oh my goodness. Nothing good can come out of that, that’s got to be a problem.’ And then sure enough, it turned out to be a superspreader event.”

More than 100,000 people across more than 80 countries have been infected with the new virus — and more than 3,400 of them have died, including at least 14 in the United States.

Proponents of closed borders and small social safety nets have a tendency to highlight the tension between citizen and noncitizen, to imply or explicitly state that the only way to help one group is to deprive the other. But the truth is, people on both sides are hanging by a thread.

Infectious diseases, especially those like Covid-19, have a knack for penetrating and exposing such false dichotomies. Already, citizens who are underinsured or uninsured are being slammed with medical bills that they can’t afford when they seek testing and treatment for the virus. Unsurprisingly, experts say that many of them are bound to avoid such care as the outbreak rages on. If quarantines become routine, tens of millions of low-wage workers, many of whom don’t have health insurance or paid sick leave, will not be able to stock up and stay home. One shudders to think what will happen if the courts dismantle the Affordable Care Act in the next year — a move that could ultimately leave 21 million or so more people without health insurance.

Among noncitizens, the effects of the public charge rule and other fear-based immigration policies have long been apparent. New mothers are turning away free baby formula. Hungry families are turning away food assistance. The chronically and even fatally ill are avoiding hospitals and rejecting medical care. In 2019, The Atlantic reported that at least 200 eligible families in a Virginia county had stopped accepting WIC and that many were also turning down reduced-price lunches. Both of those programs are exempted from the public charge rule — using them will not count against a person’s visa or green card application — but those families were too afraid to chance it.

It’s easy to see how all this fear might feed on itself in the months ahead and also where that might lead. If citizens struggling to cover their own health care nurture resentments against any group perceived to be getting help to which they themselves are not entitled — or worse, if they grow xenophobic and subscribe to the notion that immigrants carry diseases — they might be compelled to endorse policies even more draconian than those already in play. That would create more anxiety among noncitizen communities, which would lead to fewer people seeking medical care when they need it. From there, the epidemic would only get worse.",100000 people across 80 countries infected new virus wisdom measures sorely tested,the United States,,TRV,114.0675048828125,111.23408508300781,104.22027587890625,107.24283599853516,-2.483985077709561,-6.305449628023233,-8.632808277890204,-5.983008825597336

Mohammad Choirul Anam, a member of Indonesia’s National Commission on Human Rights, said his organization would investigate the disaster and the role of the police. The police have said that fans attacked officers and that the use of force was necessary. The government appointed an independent commission to investigate the deaths on Monday.

“From the videos that have been circulated, there were violent actions,” Mr. Anam said. “Not only the usage of tear gas, but also there was also use of force. We want to investigate why that happened.”

He said an initial examination suggested that tear gas played a major role in the disaster.

The United States is confidently, firmly marching down the same path as the Soviet Union.” This still seems to represent Mr. Putin’s fundamental assessment of the country. He is convinced that America is nearing its end.

For proof, advisers and officials have turned to Hollywood. This year, high-ranking Russian officials eagerly watched the American film “Civil War,” starring Kirsten Dunst. (Curiously, it was released in Russia under the title “The Fall of the Empire,” though the film contains no such imperial theme.) From the Russian elite’s perspective, the movie — which depicts California and Texas seceding, with bloodshed erupting across the nation — reflects how Americans see their near future.

The film generated immense excitement in Russia’s ruling circles. “The disintegration of the country amid deepening tensions between the federal center and states like Texas, Florida and Alabama seems frightening,” Maria Zakharova, the official spokeswoman for Russia’s foreign ministry, wrote on Telegram. “But it’s no longer such an impossible prophecy.” Dmitri Medvedev, the former president and now deputy chairman of the security council, took it as proof that civil war in the United States is inevitable. “Hollywood,” he remarked on his Telegram channel, “doesn’t make films about it for no reason.”

How would such conflict come about? The answer, for the Kremlin, is simple: culture war. Again, Mr. Patrushev has given the clearest expression of the theory. “Projects like Black Lives Matter and the rampant promotion of transgender theories are aimed at the spiritual degradation of a population already in a state of apathy,” he said in the same 2023 interview. “Ordinary citizens won’t lift a finger to preserve America’s unity, knowing they mean nothing to their own government. The U.S. authorities, without understanding the consequences, are destroying themselves step by step.”

Russia has been trying to help. As part of a broad assault on so-called woke culture and its supposed threat to traditional family and religious values — which at home has seen the banning of gender transition, the labeling of L.G.B.T.Q. groups as extremist organizations and the restricting of books that mention same-sex love — an army of Russian bots and propagandists promote conspiracy theories, vaccine skepticism, anti-feminism, anti-L.G.B.T. sentiment and anti-immigrant rhetoric on social media.

They say that the country is on the verge of catastrophe and that only one person — the great leader — can save it. They use this rhetorical strategy because it works. That is, it works in times when a critical number of people are feeling insecure, precarious, frightened, as many Americans clearly are.

No, most American cities are not in fact teeming with murderers and drug-dealing terrorists, but we do live in a world of profound economic anxiety, routine violence and an opioid epidemic. It is not true, as speakers at the Republican convention claimed, that Biden’s policies are to blame for the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, but we do live in a world of unrelenting news of war carnage. Nor is it true that the United States is overrun by millions of dangerous immigrants, but we do live in an era of mass displacement, of what Hannah Arendt described as “homelessness on an unprecedented scale, rootlessness to an unprecedented depth.” She was writing about preconditions for totalitarianism in the 20th century.

The Biden campaign’s approach to these anxieties is to insist that Americans are wrong — that experts’ objective economic data disproves ordinary people’s subjective sense of precarity. Rather than listen to their lived experience, which tells them that they are insecure despite all the job creation and economic growth, or accept what they see and hear, which tells them that the president is too old for the job, Americans should fear only Donald Trump, the Democrats insist — and put their trust in Biden, the only leader who can save us from the autocratic abyss.

It is in this kind of environment that conspiracy theories flourish — not, as it is often mistakenly thought, in a low-information environment, but in a low-trust environment. Starting immediately after the attempted assassination, social media saw a rapid profusion of posts that used the phrase “inside job,” promoting the baseless claim that the Secret Service tried to have Trump killed. According to the nonpartisan media watchdog group NewsGuard, posts about the shooting that used the word “staged” — promoting the equally baseless theory that the shooting was organized by the Trump campaign, to generate sympathy or admiration — were also proliferating, and at an even greater rate.

This second conspiracy theory concerns me even more, because I saw people I know embracing it.

The thing about conspiracy theories is that they tend to be so utterly implausible. This one would have required that the Secret Service be in cahoots with both Trump and the shooter; that Trump be willing to put his life in the hands of a 20-year-old and able to comport himself comfortably onstage despite knowing he was about to be shot; and that the shooter be willing to die for the cause of a fake news event. A world in which all of this is true seems far scarier than the world in which we are living now. And yet, people find reassurance in taking nothing at face value, in “doing their own research” by reading self-proclaimed experts on social media.",julian zelizer many americans feeling insecure precarious frightened says biden campaigns approach insist americans wrong zelizer says conspiracy theories flourish lowtrust environment,the United States,,TRV,200.92739868164062,202.8430633544922,205.9140625,205.1240692138672,0.9534113741684563,1.5139778973564797,2.481823709000729,2.0886502088627426

Their urgent mission was not a haphazard scouring of the debris, but a carefully orchestrated plan learned after specialized training in urban search-and-rescue operations. Many of the men and women working around the clock in Florida first spent hours practicing for similar situations in Disaster City, Texas, a one-of-a-kind instructional facility that includes debris from real-world disasters.

There, on a sprawling 52-acre center operated by the Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service near the flagship campus in College Station, rescue workers learn how to listen for the muffled sounds of survivors, safely lift debris and dig passageways to reach them.

Joy has been in short supply the last two weeks. The U.S. team came into the World Cup as the favorite to win it, but it is far from living up to its potential. The team lacks chemistry, despite its repeated claims to possess it in abundance. It has struggled to score goals, producing only four in three matches. Game after game, it has looked disorganized, or frustrated, or on its heels. In many ways, it has been the worst showing of the United States ever at this tournament. And it can still get worse.

The country’s vulnerability in the face of extreme weather was punctuated by the downpour that flooded the country’s largest city.

Unlike their peers in the poultry business, dairy farmers have no Red Book for dealing with bird flu. They have been pressured to take instruction from public health authorities, but without the support they need to make those steps bearable for their livelihood. As a result, these farmers have been hesitant to act, despite being maligned for moving too slowly. Unless something changes, the specter of bird flu’s devastation will hang over the United States indefinitely — as will the threat of other emerging diseases.

Scientists have long considered bird flu, or H5N1, a leading candidate for causing a human pandemic. Since 2003 the virus has infected at least 954 people around the world and killed at least 464 — an almost 50 percent mortality rate — mostly in people in proximity to infected birds. These have been largely one-off infections, including the first U.S. death from bird flu in January (a person over 65 with underlying health conditions). But scientists fear that bird flu could adapt to pass from one person to another, resulting in a fast-moving lethal epidemic that would resemble the world-spanning 1918 flu.

That’s to say nothing of the devastation to animals. In the wild world, avian flu has infected and killed members of at least 48 mammal species including sea lions and foxes, and has devastated wild bird populations. The current outbreak in poultry, which began in the United States in 2022, has affected more than 162 million commercial, backyard and wild birds — including roughly 10 percent of all laying chickens in the last three months. This has sent egg prices soaring. (Just ask Waffle House customers.)

Bird flu is far less dangerous to cattle, which may explain the initial muted response. According to Jamie Jonker, the chief scientific officer of the National Milk Producers Federation, bird flu infections seem to sicken 10 percent to 15 percent of cows on a farm, but kill only about 1 percent to 2 percent. Symptoms mostly resemble bad colds, though sick cows may stop producing milk. Most cows recover in four to six weeks after the infection is cleared, though some never return to productivity.

But while bird flu may be relatively mild in cows, it poses a potentially greater risk to humans. That’s because unlike birds, mammals like cows have respiratory systems more similar to humans, which could encourage mutations that make spread easier.",scientists long considered bird flu h5n1 leading candidate causing human pandemic since 203 virus infected least 954 people around world killed least 464 current outbreak,the United States,,TRV,241.362548828125,240.25706481933594,239.05198669433594,257.436767578125,-0.4580180372458202,-0.501578642820003,-0.9572993594107346,6.65978165545745

By 2018, those who had landed jobs in 2010 and 2011 had a lower employment rate than people at the same age who graduated before the recession hit, and those working earned less.

The effects are likely to persist. Lisa B. Kahn, an economics professor at the University of Rochester, tracked young white men who graduated from college from 1979 to 1988, a period that included the double-dip recession of the early 1980s. Over the next two decades, she found, they got stuck in low-quality, low-pay jobs. Even after the economy recovered, they had a hard time moving into better jobs.

The causes seem varied. Recession graduates, with limited opportunities, will start in jobs that are a worse fit. Once the economy recovers, they will compete for jobs with people who have more experience. In addition, Ms. Kahn noted, recession graduates seem more risk averse. “People that graduate into a recession don’t change jobs as often as people that graduate into booms,” she noted. And these job changes are one of the best ways to get a raise.

The difficult start shadowed many through their careers. Till von Wachter of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Hannes Schwandt of Northwestern University followed Americans who entered the labor market in 1981 and 1982, during the largest postwar recession up to that time.

They not only earned less in midlife. They were also less likely to be married or to have children, and more likely to die young, recording higher mortality rates starting in their 30s — driven by heart disease, lung cancer, liver failure and drug overdoses — what two Princeton scholars, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, have called “deaths of despair.”",2018 landed jobs 2010 201 lower employment rate people age graduated recession hit recession graduates limited opportunities start jobs worse fit,Los Angeles,,TRV,85.47499084472656,83.65425109863281,85.69025421142578,95.80732727050781,-2.1301432478668487,2.4338310200068767,0.2518436850028625,12.088139844964617

disaster,Review: ‘Are We Not Drawn Onward to New Era’ Stages a Disaster in Reverse,2023-01-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/06/theater/are-we-not-drawn-onward-to-new-era-review.html,New York,"Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: A woman. A man. A tree. An apple. So begins “Are We Not Drawn Onward to New Era,” a performance piece by the Belgian provocateurs Ontroerend Goed, presented by the Brooklyn Academy of Music in association with the Public Theater’s Under the Radar festival. In the show’s first minutes, an apple is plucked and eaten, a paradise destroyed. Then the story changes.

For nearly three decades, this collective (its name is a Flemish pun that translates loosely to “feel estate”) has goaded theatergoers, sometimes gently and sometimes (“The Smile Off Your Face,” “A Game of You”) less gently. “Are We Not Drawn,” directed by Alexander Devriendt, falls on the milder end of that spectrum, even as it functions as an allegory about climate destruction.

After the apple is devoured, the tree that held it is torn apart by one of the six actors. Not everything in the show is entirely real; the tree very much is. On opening night on Wednesday at BAM Fisher’s Fishman Space, audience members groaned as he ripped branch after branch. If I’m honest I groaned, too — that poor defenseless sapling — even though there’s currently a Christmas tree in the corner of my apartment slowly turning into tinder. Soon a rainbow of plastic grocery bags, the kind that have recently been outlawed in New York, litters the stage. (OK, fine, I have a few of those in my apartment, too.) Then the smoke begins to billow.

This first half-hour, which ends with the stage strewn with trash and filled with smoke is ugly, deliberately, and just a little unintelligible. There’s sparse dialogue throughout, rendered without supertitles. The non-Belgians in the theater will probably assume that it is Flemish. (I did.) It is not. This is one more show in which the troupe toys with its audience, though here it displays better than usual sportsmanship. To say more would ruin the show’s central surprise. But remember that its title is a palindrome, a type of wordplay in which a word or phrase reads the same backward and forward. So after advancing, the show must then reverse. “Are we not drawn” is a parable of disaster, but run the tape backward and it instead promises repair. Paradise, it suggests, can be regained.",drawn onward new era performance piece belgian provocateurs ontroerend goed show first minutes apple plucked eaten paradise destroyed,New York,,TRV,179.33651733398438,185.37969970703125,180.8377227783203,182.84576416015625,3.369744468602819,-2.4500940156278963,0.8370885454077335,1.9567943430263495
disaster,Government Watchdog Calls F.A.A. Air Traffic Control Systems Critically Outdated,2024-09-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/politics/faa-air-traffic-control.html,the United States,"The F.A.A. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The accountability office’s examination was prompted by a severe systems outage in January 2023 that resulted in thousands of flights across the country being grounded. The F.A.A.’s Notice to Air Missions system provides critical information to pilots about hazards like runway closures and airspace restrictions. The outage was determined to have been caused by contract personnel unintentionally deleting files while working on the system.

While the F.A.A. is trying to update these systems, the report found that some could take more than 10 years to modernize.

The agency has long faced criticism for not upgrading its technological systems quickly enough. More than two decades ago, Congress initiated a major overhaul of the national aviation system, known as the Next Generation Air Transportation System, or NextGen. This multibillion-dollar project aims to enable airlines to operate more flights and update some of the F.A.A.’s aging technology, but it has been plagued by problems and has taken longer than expected.

The report follows similar findings in previous years regarding the agency’s ability to modernize the nation’s air traffic control system. Reports released in 2016 and 2019 raised concerns about the increasing number of aging F.A.A. systems, many of which rely on outdated software languages and unsupported hardware. The accountability office previously found that some F.A.A. systems contained components that were over 50 years old.

Paul Rinaldi, the former president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the controllers’ union, said the issues facing the F.A.A. stemmed from funding problems and poor project management on the agency’s part. As a result, he said, the United States is using outdated technology compared with other countries, resulting in increasing outages, delays and cancellations.",agency long faced criticism upgrading technological systems quickly enough accountability offices examination prompted severe systems outage january 2023 resulted thousands flights grounded,the United States,,TRV,236.56796264648438,237.3812255859375,236.02249145507812,233.18600463867188,0.3437756027296162,-0.57238483266971,-0.2305769493485369,-1.4295925661186561

Over the next 30 years, 7.5 million more are projected to leave those perennially flooded zones, according to the study.

All of this suggests a possible boom for inland and Northern cities. But it also will leave behind large swaths of coastal and other vulnerable land where older adults and the poor are very likely to disproportionately remain.

The Southern United States stands to be especially transformed. Extreme heat, storms and coastal flooding will weigh heavily on the bottom third of this country, making the environment less comfortable and life within it more expensive and less prosperous.

The young, mobile and middle class will be more likely to leave to chase opportunity and physical and economic safety. That means government — from local to federal — must now recognize its responsibility to support the communities in climate migration’s wake. Even as an aging population left behind will require greater services, medical attention and physical accommodation, the residents that remain will reside in states that may also face diminished representation in Congress, because their communities are shrinking. Local governments could be left to fend alone, but with an evaporating tax base to work with.

In December, the First Street Foundation created one of the first clear pictures of how this demographic change is unfolding. It looked at flood risk and migration patterns down to the census tract, across the country, and identified hundreds of thousands of so-called abandonment zones where the out-migration of residents in response to rising risk had already passed a tipping point, and people were making small, local moves to higher ground.",young mobile middle class likely leave chase opportunity physical economic safety southern united states stands especially transformed,Texas,,CNP,29.499563217163086,29.657472610473633,29.904207229614258,29.104787826538086,0.5352940046877505,0.8319475579773101,1.3716949280650592,-1.3382414774036941

Maui is still reeling from the deadliest wildfire in the nation in more than a century.

Recovery teams with cadaver dogs are searching for bodies in the ruins of incinerated cars, houses, businesses and historic landmarks and painstakingly working to identify the dead and notify their families. Only about one-third of the burn area has been searched, and the toll is expected to rise substantially.

The fire devastated much of the west side of the island, including Lahaina, a coastal community of 13,000 that was once the capital of the Hawaiian kingdom, and wiped out more than 2,000 structures, the vast majority of them residential.

Mr. Biden said in his remarks Tuesday that he wanted to ensure that his visit didn’t disrupt recovery efforts before ticking through the assistance the federal government has begun to provide, including supplies, one-time cash payments and additional personnel to help aid firefighters and relieve first responders.

The fire’s stunning toll — abetted by hurricane-driven winds and drought-parched grasslands — has raised questions about whether Hawaii’s management of electrical infrastructure should have been more aggressive. Although an official cause for the fire has yet to be determined, witnesses have posted photos of a downed power line in an area of Lahaina where the authorities reported a critical flare-up, and the fire has already prompted lawsuits against Maui’s dominant utility.",onethird burned area recovered death toll expected rise bodies found,Hawaii,,HE,20.929758071899414,14.42456340789795,14.209999084472656,12.109999656677246,-31.081079110682268,-1.4874926703695694,-32.10624300740867,-42.13980106661481

But after Hurricane Ida, a Category 4 storm, barreled through Louisiana in 2021, his premium jumped to $6,109. Then his provider failed, leaving him facing a premium of nearly $13,000 a year from the state’s insurer of last resort.

“We were on the verge of being priced out of our home,” said Mr. Loht, 42, a research manager at a local community college.

Mr. Loht’s experience has become increasingly common as insurance companies react to cascading natural disasters by raising rates, reducing coverage and exiting some markets entirely. Last month, State Farm, the largest insurer in California, announced that it would stop issuing new home insurance policies in the state, signaling that more of the costly wrath of climate change is landing on homeowners. And Allstate, the state’s fourth largest insurer, quietly stopped selling new home, condominium and commercial insurance policies last year, confirming the change to The San Francisco Chronicle last week.

“We should absolutely be nervous that this could happen regardless if you live in California or if you live in Northern Colorado or a place like Nebraska or northern Mississippi,” said Pat Howard, a home insurance expert at Policygenius, an online insurance marketplace. “These disasters are wiping out large swaths of homes and insurance companies are responding in kind by getting out of there.”",shawn loht bought house near new orleans 2016 20ayear premium hurricane ida category 4 storm barreled louisiana 2021 premium jumped,California,,PCG,16.56756019592285,16.74666976928711,16.856128692626953,16.876026153564453,1.0810859972510334,0.6536160612696151,1.741768210234818,1.8618671306684775

The overpowering earthquake and tsunami that ripped through northern Japan in March 2011 caused a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, leading to the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl.

Under Wednesday’s ruling by the Sendai High Court, the government and the Tokyo Electric Power Company, known as Tepco, must compensate 3,550 plaintiffs, the Kyodo news agency reported. The plaintiffs had sought monthly compensation payments of about $475 per person until radiation at their homes returns to pre-crisis levels.

In 2017, a lower court had ordered the government and Tepco to pay about half that amount to about 2,900 plaintiffs.

Wildfires have killed more than 120 people as they swept the forested hillsides of Chile, and record-breaking rains have swelled rivers and triggered mudslides in Southern California.

Behind these risks are two powerful forces: Climate change, which can intensify both rain and drought, and the natural weather phenomenon known as El Niño, which can also supersize extreme weather.

In California, meteorologists had been warning for days that an unusually strong storm, known as an atmospheric river, was gathering force because of extraordinarily high Pacific Ocean temperatures. The rains began over the weekend and several counties were under a state of emergency. By Monday, officials warned that the Los Angeles area could be deluged by the equivalent of a year’s rainfall in a single day.

In the southern hemisphere, Chile has been reeling from drought for the better part of a decade. That set the stage for a hellish weekend, when, amid a severe heat wave, wildfires broke out.

As more than 300 aftershocks rocked the island over the next 24 hours to Thursday morning, the buildings shook again and again.

But for the most part, they stood.

Even the two buildings that suffered the most damage remained largely intact, allowing residents to climb to safety out the windows of upper stories. One of them, the rounded, red brick Uranus Building, which leaned precariously after its first floors collapsed, was mostly drawing curious onlookers.

The building is a reminder of how much Taiwan has prepared for disasters like the magnitude-7.4 earthquake that jolted the island on Wednesday. Perhaps because of improvements in building codes, greater public awareness and highly trained search-and-rescue operations — and, likely, a dose of good luck — the casualty figures were relatively low. By Thursday, 10 people had died and more than 1,000 others were injured. Several dozen were missing.

“Similar level earthquakes in other societies have killed far more people,” said Daniel Aldrich, a director of the Global Resilience Institute at Northeastern University.

Many Australians in disaster zones complain that their government, after dismissing climate change for years, has yet to outline recovery plans that are clear and that take future threats into account.

Oceanic sharks and rays have declined by 71 percent since 1970, mainly because of overfishing. The collapse is probably even more stark, the authors point out, because of incomplete data from some of the worst-hit regions and because fishing fleets were already expanding in the decades before they started their analysis.

“There is a very small window to save these iconic creatures,” said Nathan Pacoureau, a marine biologist at Simon Fraser University in Canada and the study’s lead author.

Texas, the nation’s leading energy-producing state, seemed like the last place on Earth that could run out of energy.

Then last week, it did.

The crisis could be traced to that other defining Texas trait: independence, both from big government and from the rest of the country. The dominance of the energy industry and the “Republic of Texas” ethos became a devastating liability when energy stopped flowing to millions of Texans who shivered and struggled through a snowstorm that paralyzed much of the state.

Part of the responsibility for the near-collapse of the state’s electrical grid can be traced to the decision in 1999 to embark on the nation’s most extensive experiment in electrical deregulation, handing control of the state’s entire electricity delivery system to a market-based patchwork of private generators, transmission companies and energy retailers.",state texas state transition since end world war ii states energy system control private companies since 1970s,Texas,,CNP,19.304906845092773,18.62027359008789,18.62027359008789,17.65637969970703,-3.5464209203315256,0.0,-3.5464209203315256,-8.53942035884411

The BRIC program was created in the aftermath of the brutal disaster season of 2017, when the United States was struck in quick succession by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as wildfires in California that were then the worst on record. Federal disaster spending skyrocketed.

A few months later, federal researchers reported that for every $1 the government spent to protect a community before a disaster, it saved $6 later. In 2018, Congress created the program to take advantage of those savings by providing more money upfront. The first grants were set to be awarded this year.

If the Biden White House approves the plan, it may find allies in Congress, even among Republicans.

Using Covid funds to increase that money has received bipartisan support in Congress in the past. In October, Representative Peter A. DeFazio, the Democratic chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which has jurisdiction over FEMA, sent a letter to the agency urging it to use the Covid money.

That letter was co-signed by Representative Sam Graves, the top Republican on the committee. But FEMA was unable to get permission from the Trump administration’s budget office, according to former officials.

The new money would present some challenges, according to people familiar with the program. State and local governments must provide 25 percent of the cost of any projects, an particularly significant hurdle as the economic downturn from Covid has devastated government budgets. And those officials would need to devise projects on a large enough scale to make use of the new funds.

Still, the extra funding is worth pursuing, said Mr. Kaniewski, the former FEMA official. “The more mitigation dollars, the better,” he said. “This is about as good of a taxpayer investment as you can find.”",bric program created aftermath brutal disaster season 2017 fema unable get permission trump administrations budget office,California,,PCG,11.661972045898438,11.293803215026855,11.00523853302002,11.671921730041504,-3.1570032017103697,-2.555070922635602,-5.631410453512395,0.0853173383018505

That includes blocking spending on the island’s electrical grid, suspending its $15-an-hour minimum wage for federally funded relief work and requiring budget plans to be submitted to Puerto Rico’s federally mandated fiscal control board.

“The Trump administration has finally showed signs of relenting in its attempts to illegally withhold vital aid to Puerto Rico, and must provide the rest of the assistance this Congress has already enacted for the island,” said Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee. “However, there are still urgent unmet needs on the island that necessitate additional relief.”

Securing congressional approval for disaster aid and getting it spent have become fraught during the Trump administration. The president has repeatedly clashed with the island’s leadership and balked at sending funds. Once the federal money has been approved, his administration has slow-walked its distribution.

This time, lawmakers included language that would allow Puerto Rican officials to combine the new money with previously allocated funds that have yet to be spent. The package would also set deadlines for the administration to complete grant agreements and establish procedural steps to spend the money.

How should we live when our lives can be upended by a thing as savage and ordinary as the weather? How can we be decent to each other when catastrophe waits somewhere just beyond the circuit of our vision or even worse, inside ourselves?

These are the abiding concerns that Will Arbery, a Pulitzer Prize finalist, has delineated, at oblique angles, in his previous plays, “Heroes of the Fourth Turning” and “Corsicana.” In “Evanston Salt Costs Climbing,” a slightly earlier script now making its New York debut courtesy of the New Group, these themes sprawl center stage. The rest of the show can only huddle at the fringes.

“Evanston,” directed by Danya Taymor at the Pershing Square Signature Center, opens in 2014 in the break room of the salt dome facility in Evanston, Ill. It’s January, and Peter (Jeb Kreager) and Basil (Ken Leung) are downing paper cups of coffee before they begin a long shift salting the local roads. Salting is a human response to an inhuman threat, an imperfect assurance of safety. It is also an environmental calamity, spoiling the ground around and below the roads. (When warriors salted the fields of their enemies, this wasn’t a friendly gesture.) So Maiworm (Quincy Tyler Bernstine), an assistant director of public works, has tasked herself with finding a greener option, though this alternative might put Peter and Basil out of a job.

The play follows these characters for three Januarys, a framing that suggests a work of ultrarealism, informed by Arbery’s own chill years in Evanston, where he attended graduate school. But Taymor and Arbery often slide the work into spaces more dreamlike and dire, closer in spirit to Arbery’s debut play, “Plano.” “Evanston” is often a comedy, though only insofar as you find paralyzing dread funny. Polar vortexes threaten the city, but all of the characters — the fourth is Maiworm’s stepdaughter, Jane Jr. (Rachel Sachnoff) — reckon with internal tempests as well. Peter wants to kill himself. Jane Jr. has suicidal thoughts, too. Maiworm suffers from crippling anxiety. Basil, an immigrant from Greece, seems the most well-adjusted of the bunch, at first.

During his term, as the director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a Health and Human Services office, I witnessed how his administration systematically undermined America’s health infrastructure. My experience during his time in office, which led me to file a whistle-blower complaint, provides a stark warning of what a second Trump presidency could mean for public health.

In early 2020, as Covid began its relentless spread, I and other public health experts urgently warned the Trump administration and senior advisers about critical shortages in medical supplies and the desperate need for a coordinated national response. Our recommendations, grounded in decades of pandemic preparedness planning, were not just ignored; they were actively suppressed.

When I opposed the administration’s reckless promotion of the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment, I faced swift retaliation. I was removed from my position, silenced and sidelined at a time when experienced leadership was crucial. This wasn’t just a personal injustice; it was a microcosm of the administration’s broader war on scientific expertise. (Under the Trump administration, Health and Human Services officials denied any wrongdoing; my whistle-blower complaint was settled under the Biden administration.)

The consequences of this approach became tragically apparent as the pandemic unfolded. By the time Mr. Trump left office, over 400,000 Americans had died of Covid-19. Hydroxychloroquine was ineffective for Covid, and studies have suggested that its use was harmful.

Still, few progressives are declaring mission accomplished: The Biden administration and Democratic legislators are mired in political trench warfare over how to pay for desperately needed infrastructure and a climate change package.

President Biden has so far ruled out any measure that would increase deficit levels. And Republicans are arguing against any new taxes on the affluent or businesses. Because many states and cities now report surpluses rather than the yawning deficits that were predicted last year, most conservatives say Congress should use as-yet unspent local aid dollars from spring’s American Rescue Plan to pay for the infrastructure, rather than issue new spending.

The standoff is a microcosm of a much larger dilemma that we’ll be stuck with for years: For America to tackle climate change, it most likely needs not only to expand federal efforts but also to build up state and local governments’ capacities to make their cities more eco-friendly and build things like new flood walls or drainage systems. Yet for such efforts to be politically viable, policymakers probably have to avoid burdening people with unpopular middle-class tax hikes. (This knowledge has led President Biden to pledge, first as a candidate and now as president, that he will never increase taxes on families earning under $400,000 annually.)

One way to avoid this circular debate on deficits, taxes and spending, while still undertaking a green transformation, is to provide states and cities with cheap, reliable low-cost loans that are easy to pay back.

Those changes would better protect millions of Americans as climate change worsens, and they reflect the sort of policy changes that experts say the United States must adopt to cope with the effects of global warming.

Populism May Take Us All the Way Down.,2024-11-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/opinion/spain-floods-valencia-populism.html,Spain,"When water mixes with dirt it becomes mud, tons of mud, the kind of mud that, in the wake of flash floods on Oct. 29 and 30, has turned the Spanish region of València into a kind of war zone. More than 200 people are dead; nearly 90 are still missing; hundreds of houses, roads and railways are destroyed; and towns are cut off without electricity, water, or provisions. Hundreds of families have lost everything. Large swaths of the region have been transformed into a brown hell, reeking of decay, after rivers topped their banks, sending water coursing through towns and cities.

But there is more than one kind of mud.

When administrative incompetence mixes with political partisanship, as has happened here, then another kind of mud emerges: populism. In this catastrophe, those anti-government forces that have been swirling in the dark edges of Spanish politics for years are now feeding on the many levels of incompetence of the state, and the absence of an effective public response by regional or national authorities.

Right now both València and Spain, mired in this morass, are at risk of being engulfed by the zeitgeist undermining so many Western democracies — and summarized in the slogan that quickly emerged on Spanish social media after the floods: “Only the people save the people.” It is the old trick of populism: confronting established institutions with the philosophical falsehood of the peoples’s purity; the idea that the average citizen is more capable at solving the problems of society than the government is.

I was born here. I grew up here. I belong to a people — the Valèncian people — with an almost pathological obsession with water due to our history of severe droughts and torrential autumn rains. Water turned us into one of the main agricultural regions of the Mediterranean and enriched us with the export of our oranges, one of the largest sources of foreign currency in Spain during the years of Francisco Franco’s dictatorship. We had little industry but we had water, and that allowed us to survive. However, in this century, with the acceleration of climate change, we are increasingly vulnerable to flooding and brutal weather events, such as the recent torrential rains that have caused the destruction of the area around València, a destruction that now threatens to also be political.",200 people killed hundreds homes destroyed flooding flooding latest long line natural disasters region,Spain,,ITX.MC,51.63999938964844,51.68000030517578,52.0,51.02000045776367,0.07746110766872352,0.6191944522728082,0.6971351948228854,-1.2006176204739623

The power plant, built in a predominantly Black and Vietnamese area of the city already populated with junkyards, truck stops and a NASA facility, was sold as a down payment on energy resilience — a guarantee that, even if storms cut off connections to the rest of the electrical grid, the city would be able to swiftly fire up its own power plant and send electricity to hospitals, nursing homes and at least some of the neighborhoods sweltering through the aftermath of a powerful summer storm.

But a summary statement issued by the regulator, the Civil Aviation Administration of China, did not put forward any theories to address why the plane, a Boeing 737-800, suddenly turned almost vertical while cruising at 29,000 feet and maintained that position except for a brief surge upward about two-thirds of the way down to the ground.

Commercial jets are designed to be naturally stable from front to back while in flight. They do not fly almost straight down at very high speed unless extreme force is continuously applied to the horizontal stabilizers on either side of the tail, aviation experts said in the days after the crash.

A mechanical failure or software error can cause the horizontal stabilizers to malfunction, or a pilot can deliberately force the plane to fly almost straight down. The report did not address these possibilities. But it did mention that key components of the tail had been found at the crater left by the plane in a bamboo-swathed hillside.

The aircraft’s engines were also found there.

Earlier this month, Wu Shijie, a safety official from the Civil Aviation Administration of China, cautioned against a plethora of theories about the crash that had spread online within China. Some of these theories have suggested pilot suicide as a cause of the crash. Chinese aviation authorities have stepped up checks on the health and mental well-being of commercial aircraft pilots in recent days.

But Mr. Wu said these measures for pilots should not be taken as a sign that the cause of the crash had been identified. “We still cannot come to a conclusion on the cause and nature” of the crash, he told reporters, according to an official Chinese aviation news website.",chinas regulator obligation produce preliminary report wednesday 30 days crash put forward theories address plane boeing 73780 suddenly turned almost vertical,China,,0700.HK,338.6602783203125,336.7995300292969,323.77410888671875,316.1449279785156,-0.5494439147822607,-3.8674107239535322,-4.395605385853394,-6.648358778144436

It was the highest number of illegal crossings recorded since at least 1960, when the government first began tracking such entries. The number was similarly high for the 2000 fiscal year, when border agents caught 1.6 million people, according to government data.

Single adults represented the largest group of those detained in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, at 1.1 million, or 64 percent of all crossers. There were also large numbers of migrant families — more than 479,000, which is about 48,000 fewer than during the last surge in family crossings in 2019.

But the nearly 147,000 children whom agents encountered without parents or guardians was the largest number since 2008, when the government started tallying unaccompanied minors.

Debby is certainly loaded with a lot of water. One big reason: The waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean have been abnormally hot for months. This warmth causes more of the water to evaporate, providing storms with more moisture to unleash as rain. The extra heat in the ocean also gives storms more energy with which they could potentially generate stronger winds.

But other factors stopped Debby’s winds from intensifying to the highest levels, said Kim Wood, an associate professor of hydrology and atmospheric sciences at the University of Arizona. Before making landfall in Florida this week, the storm crossed Cuba, where the mountainous terrain very likely disrupted the low-level winds that channel energy from the sea surface into the storm.

“The water was plenty warm, but the storm itself had to be organized,” Dr. Wood said.

Emergency responders arrived at a farm field about two miles south of Wittman Regional Airport in Oshkosh, Wis., which is hosting the Experimental Aircraft Association AirVenture showcase, and found a plane engulfed in fire, the Winnebago County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.

The crash, which occurred just before 1 p.m. local time, came on the first day of the event, which showcases aerobatic displays and historic aircraft over the course of one week. Air traffic controllers at the airport were the first to report the crash, the sheriff’s office said.

The cause of the crash is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, and the names of those on board were not immediately released. The make and the model of the airplane were also unclear. Dick Knapinski, communications director for the Experimental Aircraft Association, said in an email that the plane was not part of the air show, and it “appeared to be an arrival of a private aircraft to the event, well prior to any air show program.”",two people killed plane crash oshkosh wisconsin authorities say crash occurred first day experimental aircraft association airventure showcase cause crash investigation national transportation,the United States,,TRV,200.92738342285156,202.8430633544922,205.9140625,217.65489196777344,0.9534190407531848,1.5139778973564797,2.4818314916558557,8.325151236214948

The fastest is what FEMA calls “serious needs assistance,” which is a one-time payment of $770. That money is meant to be used for immediate needs, such as food or other supplies, for people who had to leave their homes.

You can apply for the $770 payment online, at www.disasterassistance.gov. You can also call FEMA at 1-800-621-FEMA (1-800-621-3362).

That one-time payment for disaster survivors is a relatively new program, introduced by FEMA a year ago. The program is a grant, not a loan: If you get the $770 from FEMA, you do not need to pay it back.

It’s also important to know that the $770 payment is not the only help that FEMA offers. The agency also offers a range of help through its “individual assistance program,” which pays for things like car damage, medical bills or even funeral costs.

In ideal circumstances, a power strip with adequate surge protection can help protect your electronics from harmful power surges, and it can actually help prevent electrical fires.

Here are some local organizations in the storm area.

All Hands and Hearts prepared for Ida by stationing its disaster assessment and response team in Beaumont, Texas. Its volunteers will enter areas affected by the storm when they can, meeting initial needs that will probably include chain-saw work to clear debris and trees, roof tarping, mucking and gutting flooded houses, and sanitizing homes with mold contamination.

The Second Harvest Food Bank, which serves South Louisiana, has prepared more than 3,500 disaster-readiness food boxes with items like rehydration drinks and nutrition bars, as well as bottled water. It also maintains cooking equipment that can be transported to heat prepared meals. Donations of bottled water and cleaning supplies are welcome. Volunteers can apply to help, but donating money is the most efficient way to assist the aid effort, the organization said.

Culture Aid NOLA has set up an impromptu cooking hub at the Howlin’ Wolf nightclub in New Orleans using thawing food from the freezers of restaurants experiencing power outages. The meals will be distributed to people in need, said Julie Pfeffer, a director. The group, which was originally formed to help people during the pandemic, has a donations page.

There’s the radioactive fallout after the Castle Bravo nuclear test of 1954, when the United States tested a hydrogen bomb at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands; the explosion at Kyshtym, in 1957; the Windscale fire in Britain, also in 1957; the partial meltdown at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island, in 1979; the meltdown in Chernobyl, in 1986; and the Fukushima disaster in Japan, in 2011.

The global scope of such dire subject matter means that the experience of reading this book is a formidable exercise in cumulative disillusionment. By the time you get to the Soviets’ lies about the “Northern Lights,” you will have already read about how their American adversaries tried to cover up the extent of radioactive fallout after the Castle Bravo test in the Pacific — insisting that the skin lesions suffered by some unfortunate Japanese fishermen nearby was the result not of radiation but “vaporized coral.” (As Plokhy notes, this coral dust was itself radioactive.) In a subsequent chapter on Britain’s Windscale fire, you will learn how an official report detailing the full scale of the disaster was suppressed by the prime minister, Harold Macmillan, who “ordered the printers to destroy their type.”

Macmillan released his own interpretation of what happened at Windscale, when equipment problems and human error resulted in a raging reactor fire. He placed the blame squarely on the personnel, who felt enormously insulted, considering it was their skilled reaction that managed the fire and prevented an actual meltdown. (One of them recalls looking directly at the fire and thinking, “Oh dear, now we are in a pickle.”) Plokhy makes clear that human error certainly played a part — the reactor was “long overdue” for what is known as a periodic “annealing,” a process to release excess energy. But Windscale’s operators were responding to government pressure to produce more plutonium and tritium; it was also the government that pushed to build Windscale quickly and cheaply.

When Britain’s chief nuclear scientist, John Cockcroft, insisted that Windscale add some radiation filters during its construction, other officials gave only grudging approval, calling the filters “Cockcroft’s folly.” Those filters ended up trapping most of the radiation; without them, the lasting damage to the surrounding area would have been much worse. Plokhy adds that subsequent medical observation of the area suggested that the fire may not have been the only source of irradiation at Windscale. The pressure to produce more had also meant an increased risk of radiation leaks.

More than any spectacular explosion, radiation is the deadly stuff that lingers, both in actual fact and in the imagination. At Three Mile Island, technical malfunction combined with human error to generate a partial meltdown. Government officials worried that evacuating a 5-mile radius around the plant in an “excess of caution” would create runaway confusion and panic. As the governor of Pennsylvania put it, describing the terrors of fallout, “It is an event that people are not able to see, to hear, to taste, to smell.”",serhi plokhys new book atoms ashes global history nuclear disasters book recounts six accidents first three connected atoms war,the United States,,TRV,166.93861389160156,164.04949951171875,159.3252716064453,164.56707763671875,-1.7306447636846947,-2.879757584957439,-4.560563974791255,-1.4206037773997122

Tensions among tribes have been on the rise for years, according to experts, who say that the scarcity of basic resources like water and land has fueled conflict.

On Saturday morning, a tribal clash blocked access to the site of the disaster. Eight people died in the clash over the weekend, and 30 houses were burned down, according to the International Organization for Migration, a U.N. agency.

In February, over two dozen people were killed in a gunfight between tribes in Enga Province. At the time, the police said that up to 17 tribes were involved in the violence. Last year, over 150 people were killed in tribal clashes, prompting the provincial government to put the region under a lockdown for three months.

What is the political situation in Papua New Guinea?

The deadly landslide struck at a tense political time for the country — which, though rich in natural resources, remains underdeveloped. Prime Minister James Marape, who has been in power since 2019, is fighting off opposition attempts to put forward a motion of no confidence against his government in Parliament.

Mr. Marape had promised to transform the economy of Papua New Guinea, one of the world’s poorest countries, and won re-election in 2022. He has tried to court both the United States and China, who are vying for influence in the Pacific.

But economic worries persist. In January, a wage dispute between the government and hundreds of civil servants and police officers turned into deadly riots.

disaster,We Are Not Prepared for Fires Like This,2025-01-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/opinion/california-wildfire-los-angeles.html,"Canada, Los Angeles, Fort McMurray, Santa Rosa","Tuesday night, a historic wind event swept through Southern California, spreading horrifying fires that torched a dense urban patchwork of homes, institutions and businesses. The multiple fires in greater Los Angeles have produced only two deaths so far, somewhat mercifully. But the windstorm is expected to continue, and already much of Pacific Palisades has burned to an unrecognizable gray.

A decade ago, this kind of disaster seemed unthinkably rare. In retrospect, Canada’s 2016 Fort McMurray disaster, which formed the basis of John Vaillant’s book “Fire Weather,” was the beginning of a frightening new era. Then came Santa Rosa, Paradise, Boulder and Lahaina — the deadliest North American fire in more than a century, if one that now hardly stands out in cultural memory against the other scars of urban firestorms. In neighborhoods like these, often far from the wildland-urban interface, it’s almost impossible to clear enough brush to make homes defensible, as the wildfire expert Zeke Lunder noted on Tuesday. The homes provide the fuel, and the fires jump from house to house.

These years of fire have also initiated a set of arguments about its driving factors — to what extent the new disaster landscape is the result of climate conditions or fuel buildup from decades of fire suppression and to what extent building and population patterns have pushed more people into the path of fire. At times like this, for better or for worse, those arguments and their policy implications feel less urgent than the sheer scale of the wreckage and the simple and obvious lesson: We are not prepared.

“There’s no number of helicopters or trucks that we can buy, no number of firefighters that we can have, no amount of brush that we can clear that will stop this,” Eric Garcetti, then the mayor of Los Angeles, told me in 2019. “The only thing that will stop this is when the earth, probably long after we’re gone, relaxes into a more predictable weather state.”",decade ago kind disaster seemed unthinkably rare neighborhoods like almost impossible clear enough brush make homes defensible,Canada,,IFC.TO,256.99560546875,259.1553039550781,257.164794921875,253.96005249023438,0.8403639752473272,-0.7680757456340385,0.06583359774436805,-1.1811692160956972

If local governments continue to allow homes to go up in places most exposed to climate change, such as coastlines, floodplains or fire-prone wilderness, experts say, it will make generations of current and future residents more vulnerable to worsening hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters.

Yet those long-term concerns have typically been outweighed by the demand for new homes, and the jobs and tax revenue that come with them. In many coastal states, the most flood-prone areas have seen the highest rates of home construction since 2010, a study last year found. And in California and elsewhere, officials continue to approve development in areas hit by fires.

“Some of the most vulnerable land also ends up being some of the highest-priced land,” said Otis Rolley, senior vice president at the Rockefeller Foundation and former North America managing director for 100 Resilient Cities, an initiative that worked with cities to better withstand shocks from climate change and other challenges. “There’s a lot of pressure on elected officials.”

A wave of disasters has pushed some cities and counties to limit where they build. The new survey — a joint project of Stanford; Resources for the Future, a Washington research group; and ReconMR, a survey research company — asked whether governments should require that new buildings in risky areas “need to be made in a way that doesn’t get damaged easily by floods.”

The Federal Emergency Management Agency helped at first, paying for Ms. Swope and her son Adrian to stay in hotels, then putting a trailer in their yard and providing about $7,000 toward fixing their house.

But that covered a fraction of what repairs would cost Ms. Swope, who is 74 and, like many storm survivors, lacked insurance. And though Congress approved extra funds for victims of Hurricane Laura, that money has yet to reach Louisiana almost two years after the disaster.

While Ms. Swope sought money to rebuild, her son, paralyzed decades earlier in a diving accident, increasingly struggled. Adrian’s room was too small to maneuver in his wheelchair, so he was confined to his bed. Over time, both his spirit and his body deteriorated.

In November, 15 months after Hurricane Laura pushed him out of his home, Adrian died. He was 47. The coroner’s report cited complications from paraplegia, but Ms. Swope blamed his isolated life in the trailer. “If we were able to get one room fixed in the house,” she said, “he would have been here still today.”",two summers ago hurricane laura wrecked bety swopes modest bungalow lake charles louisiana federal emergency management agency helped first paying ms swope son adrian covered fraction,Louisiana,,XOM,79.29064178466797,81.93124389648438,81.61256408691406,83.3790283203125,3.330282177545706,-0.3889600528620643,2.9283686573654046,5.156203107483337

He also falsely claimed that the Puerto Rican authorities were inflating the hurricane’s death toll.

The most enduring images of Mr. Trump visiting the island after Maria were of him throwing paper towels at the island’s desperate residents, as if he were shooting free throws. Three years after the hurricane’s landfall, in September 2020, Mr. Trump said he would finally release $13 billion worth of aid for Puerto Rico. The announcement came less than two months before Election Day, as the Trump campaign was chasing Puerto Rican voters in Florida in what polls at the time suggested would be a competitive race in the state.

California was another state where the former president’s personal politics collided with the urgent need for federal relief. The 2018 wildfire season was the most destructive in California’s history. Mr. Trump — whose presidency the incoming Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, had positioned himself as a bulwark against — reacted to the disaster by publicly attacking the state and threatening its relief funding.

But extreme weather events have always been with us. Can we prove that climate change caused any particular disaster? Not exactly. But the burgeoning field of “extreme event attribution” comes close. Climate models say that certain kinds of extreme weather events become more likely on a warming planet — for example, what used to be a heat wave we’d experience on average only once every few decades becomes an almost annual occurrence. Event attribution compares the odds of experiencing an extreme event given global warming with the odds that the same event would have happened without climate change.

Incidentally, I’d argue that extreme event attribution gains credibility from the fact that it doesn’t always tell the same story, that sometimes it says that climate change wasn’t the culprit. For example, preliminary analyses suggest that climate change played a limited role in the extreme flooding that recently struck northeastern Italy.

That was, however, the exception that proves the rule. In general, attribution analysis shows that global warming made the disasters of recent years much more likely. We don’t yet have estimates for the latest, still ongoing series of disasters, but it seems safe to say that this global concatenation of extreme weather events would have been virtually impossible without climate change. And this is almost surely just the leading edge of the crisis, a small foretaste of the many disasters to come.

Which brings me back to the “politicization of the weather.” Worrying about the climate crisis shouldn’t be a partisan issue. But it is, at least in this country. As of last year, only 22 percent of Americans who considered themselves to be on the political right considered climate change a major threat; the left-right gap here was far larger than it was in other countries.

Structural engineers in Bangkok struggled to understand why the building buckled all at once.

Pennung Warnitchai, director of Earthquake Research Center of Thailand, who helped draft Bangkok’s earthquake-resistant standards, said that the building should have been able to stay up. The ground motion detected in Bangkok after the earthquake struck, he said, “was about one-third to one-half of the level we consider in the design of typical buildings.”

Thailand generally follows an American model for earthquake protection, which means skyscrapers start with a reinforced concrete core. The core is typically a rectangular shaft in a building’s center, with floors and vertical support columns emanating outward.

In the case of the building that fell, the designers set the core off-center, said Mr. Pennung, adding that he saw the plans. Other buildings with a similar design did not collapse. But because the earthquake’s distance created longer periods between waves of motion, and with much of Bangkok built on soft soil, he said, the building may have both swayed and twisted, compounding the danger.

Mr. Pennung and several other engineers stressed it was too early to determine the cause of the collapse. Steel quality, design, work standards and soil could all play a role. But he said that evidence from workers and officials gathered so far, plus video footage of the quake, suggested that the core and supporting pillars or columns gave way on the lower floors.

“It seems that it collapsed from the bottom, not the top,” he said.",engineers bangkok struggled understand building buckled ground motion detected bangkok earthquake struck onethird onehalf level consider design typical buildings,Thailand,,PTT.BK,32.0,32.25,32.25,30.75,0.78125,0.0,0.78125,-3.90625

The quakes happened on the Hayward Fault, one of a handful of major faults that cut through the San Francisco Bay Area. It may be a little less famous than the San Andreas Fault that ruptured in 1906 and 1989, but seismologists say it’s just as capable of causing the Big One.

In a 2018 report, the U.S.G.S. looked at what would happen if a magnitude 7.0 earthquake occurred on the Hayward Fault and estimated that 800 people would die and 18,000 would be injured from damage to buildings and structures. The cost of property loss and business disruption was estimated to be $82 billion.

The U.S.G.S. called the Hayward Fault among the most dangerous faults in the country because it runs through a densely populated region.

Aftershocks can occur days, weeks or even years after the first earthquake. These events can be of equal or larger magnitude to the initial earthquake, and they can continue to affect already damaged locations.

The crust — the layer that we live on — is just a few miles thick. Below that, filling up 84 percent of the planet, is the 1,800-mile-thick mantle, which is soft enough in places to flow up and down and generate the forces that push the continents around. Between the mantle and the inner core is the liquid outer core.

Scientists of course cannot cut into Earth and directly observe its insides. Instead, their knowledge is inferred from the vibrations generated by earthquakes that pass through the planet. The speed and the direction of the seismic vibrations change depending on the density and the elasticity of the rocks.

For this study, Dr. Vidale and his colleagues looked at earthquakes in the South Sandwich Islands, a volcanic chain in the South Atlantic Ocean.

So many earthquakes happen there that sometimes a new event is almost identical in magnitude and location to one that occurred years earlier.

An earthquake with similar force would have been devastating on the faults that run under highly populated areas of California, such as the Hayward fault that runs through Berkeley, Oakland and many other cities just east of San Francisco, Dr. Jones said.

The tectonic rupture that caused Thursday’s earthquake was almost purely horizontal, meaning that two faults had slid past each other.

After the Liberal Democrats’ losses in parliamentary elections on Sunday, the party has less than a month to form a minority government or recruit other allies to regain a majority. The Constitutional Democrats, who won the second-most seats behind the L.D.P. in the recent election, strongly oppose plans for Japan to build new nuclear reactors.

Within the next five months, Japan will release a revised energy plan that will define the nation’s target energy mix heading toward 2040. That means that the nascent government — in whatever shape it ultimately assumes — will be forced to confront two longstanding questions that have proved largely impossible to reconcile.

Is nuclear energy, widely considered clean and affordable, the best option for Japan — a nation heavily dependent on fossil fuels yet prone to frequent earthquakes and tsunamis? And if so, how can government leaders sell this to a populace still haunted by the memories of nuclear disaster?

The Fukushima crisis set back the advance of nuclear energy in many places, from nearby Taiwan to as far away as Germany. But nowhere was the horror felt as personally as in Japan.

The magnitude is calculated using data from a network of instruments, called seismometers, that record the energy spreading from the quake’s origin in the form of waves of ground movement.

Until the 1970s, a different scale was used, one developed by an American seismologist, Charles Richter. That scale was found to be inaccurate for very large earthquakes.

The moment magnitude scale is logarithmic — that is, each whole number of magnitude represents about a 30-fold increase in energy released. So a 9.5-magnitude quake — such as the one that occurred in Chile in 1960, the strongest ever recorded — is more than 30,000 times more powerful than a 6.5-magnitude quake, which itself can be very destructive.

The amount of shaking a quake causes is measured on separate scales, such as the Modified Mercalli Scale. That value varies form place to place, and depends on the geography of the area along with the strength and depth of the quake. Using that scale, the U.S.G.S. reported a maximum shake value of just over 6 — or “strong” — near the epicenter on Friday, and that people felt shaking across the region.",moment magnitude scale logarithmic whole number magnitude represents 30fold increase energy released 95magnitude quake 300 times powerful,Chile,,SQM,47.61642074584961,47.397403717041016,49.587581634521484,51.339717864990234,-0.45996113394911975,4.620881621608787,4.13966622815447,7.819355299747427

The quake — one of the three largest to hit the region in a century — gouged open roads, toppled century-old religious monuments and destroyed many multistory buildings.

A preliminary count from Myanmar’s military government said that at least 144 people had been killed and 732 injured in just three cities.

Obviously there were class differences in 1974, the year I graduated from college; some jobs paid much better than others, some people were rich while others were desperately poor. But for most Americans these differences were much narrower than they are today.

It was an era in which many though not all blue-collar jobs offered solidly middle-class incomes and lifestyles. Labor productivity in the early 1970s was less than half what it is today, but the average hourly wage of nonsupervisory workers, adjusted for inflation, was as high then as it was on the eve of the pandemic. And while the economic elite lived well, it was nothing like the extravagance we now take for granted. In 1973, C.E.O.s at major corporations were paid about 23 times as much as their workers; now the ratio is 351 to 1.

At the time, we took a broadly middle-class society for granted, imagining it was the natural condition of an advanced economy. Clearly, however, it wasn’t.

So what made that relative equality possible? A large part of the answer, surely, is that back then America still had a strong union movement.

Two strong earthquakes were among a series of tremors that shook Taiwan's eastern coast early Tuesday local time. No injuries or deaths had been reported by Tuesday morning.

The quakes damaged buildings in an area struck by a larger earthquake that killed 17 people earlier this month and were considered aftershocks of the earlier quake, authorities said.

earthquake,Was Today’s Earthquake Connected to the Solar Eclipse?,2024-04-05,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/05/science/total-solar-eclipse-earthquake.html,the United States,"With a total solar eclipse set to pass through the United States on Monday, it is easy to imagine a linkage between unusual events in the heavens and on Earth. But geoscientists were cautious about making such a connection.

Earthquakes happen along fault lines, or cracks between two blocks of rock on Earth’s crust. Tides stretch and squish the land on Earth just as they contribute to waves in the ocean, and those tidal forces grow as the sun, moon and Earth begin to align — a configuration that sometimes creates a solar eclipse.

One theory is that this may introduce additional stress along Earth’s fault lines.

“We do know that the relative position of the Earth and the moon and the sun does exert tidal forces,” said William Frank, a geophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “And we know that changes the stress that can be on a fault that can host an earthquake.”

But the results of several studies of the relationship between earthquakes and tides are inconclusive, according to Seth Stein, a geophysicist at Northwestern University. “If there’s any effect, it would be incredibly weak,” he said.",earthquakes happen along fault lines cracks two blocks rock earths crust tides stretch squish land earth contribute waves ocean tidal forces grow,the United States,,TRV,224.52101135253906,226.86936950683594,226.57461547851562,219.94215393066406,1.0459413754419282,-0.1299223553012215,0.9146601084706626,-2.0393892733207744

About 40 miles of the same fault that caused the devastating 2010 earthquake ruptured, but farther to the west. The data also revealed some surprises, Dr. Calais said: At the eastern end of this segment, the fault was not vertical, where two tectonic plates are sliding past each other. Instead, the two plates were also being pushed together, with the northern one sliding on top of the southern one.

“If we hadn’t had the aftershock distribution, then we would not have been able to put in our models the proper full geometry,” Dr. Calais said. “Then our assessment of what went on would have been wrong.”

The Caribbean is sometimes a zone of overlooked seismic dangers with active volcanoes and earthquake faults. “The Caribbean is its own small-scale Ring of Fire,” said Susan E. Hough, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey. “It’s like the Pacific Rim on a smaller scale.”

But the tectonic plates are crashing together at a slower pace, and major earthquakes occur less often. The second half of the 20th century was pretty quiet in the region. “People got kind of complacent about it,” Dr. Hough said. “The 2010 earthquake didn’t surprise any earthquake professionals in the world, but it surprised a lot of people that weren’t aware of the scientific results.”

Dr. Hough and Dr. Calais were two of the earthquake experts who traveled to Haiti in 2010. In the aftermath of the quake that year, international organizations provided financing to set up conventional seismometers, which cost tens of thousands of dollars each, in Haiti. When the magnitude-7.2 earthquake hit on Aug. 14, none of Haiti’s conventional seismometers were working, although a seismometer at the United States embassy was gathering data.",caribbean sometimes zone overlooked seismic dangers active volcanoes earthquake faults second half 20th century pretty quiet region,the United States,,TRV,161.27330017089844,161.76266479492188,163.49423217773438,169.68655395507812,0.30343809142918665,1.070436979390598,1.3771231843599998,5.216767918349976

Iceland, a country of less than 400,000 people, has more than 600 natural hot springs. The volcanic island gets the better part of its heat and energy from geothermal sources.

The country also has about 130 volcanoes, most of which are active. Iceland is above a hot spot, a place with “abnormally high magma activity,” according to the country’s tourism website, which notes that other famous hot spots include Yellowstone National Park and Hawaii.

The weather service said it would continue to review the data on earthquakes, adding that “the seismic activity last night and this morning is an example of this episodic seismic activity that can be expected while magma accumulation is in progress.”

Hidden in the organisms’ genes, however, may be evidence of the planet’s past geological violence.

In a paper published last week in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, researchers say that the genes of bull kelp along the shore of the South Island of New Zealand bear marks of an earthquake that occurred 800 years ago, when part of the ocean floor rose upward and wiped out its inhabitants. That made way for newcomers of a different genetic background, the ancestors of today’s kelp. The finding suggests that moments of cataclysmic change in an environment can be revealed by comparing genes across populations of some organisms.

New Zealand lies atop a nest of fault lines. After a quake four years ago, the edge of a fault near the town of Kaikoura shot more than six feet out of the water, and Jon Waters, a professor of zoology at University of Otago, and his colleagues began to wonder what happened to kelps after such destruction. Those stranded above the high tide line die swiftly, but as the ecosystem below the water shifts into a new normal, there’s suddenly a lot of free real estate, where new individuals can sweep in and take over. And because of the way that a population of kelp carpets an area for the long term and makes little room for new arrivals, Dr. Waters said, the algae provided an ideal test bed for seeing whether a disaster’s effects on the gene pool persist over time.

About 800 years ago, according to the geological record, there was a similar quake in New Zealand along the coastline near Dunedin. The scientists took samples of kelp along a 60-mile stretch of that shore. Each individual kelp looked much the same as the others of its species. However, when the scientists examined the genetics, there were large differences linked to where the kelps had been collected. Bull kelp that lived along a 15-mile stretch that had been forced into the air during that long-ago earthquake were distinct from their neighbors of the same species on either side, whose homes had long lain undisturbed.",new zealand lies atop nest fault lines quake four years ago edge fault near town kaikoura shot six feet water bull kelp lived along,New Zealand,,FPH.NZ,33.255733489990234,33.82572937011719,34.76013946533203,33.6295051574707,1.7139777725802325,2.762424085496095,4.523749192886134,1.1239315097138713

At least 162 people were dead after a powerful earthquake struck Java, Indonesia’s main island, yesterday. Hundreds more were injured. Officials expect the death toll to rise sharply — many people are trapped under damaged buildings or in landslides.

Damage from the 5.6-magnitude quake prevented many people from reaching the main hospital in ambulances. Instead, injured people reportedly arrived on motorbikes. Here’s a video of the damage.

The hospital itself was damaged and lost power. The government erected tents outside to treat injured people, and others were being treated in smaller hospitals nearby. “This is overwhelming,” a government official told reporters.

An earthquake struck a remote and mountainous part of Afghanistan yesterday, killing more than 1,000 people and injuring at least 1,600 others.

The quake, which had a magnitude of 5.9, struck about 28 miles southwest of the city of Khost, but the worst damage was in the neighboring Paktika province, which lies along the border with Pakistan and where some residents live in houses made of clay and straw. It was the deadliest earthquake to hit Afghanistan in more than two decades, and the number of casualties was expected to rise, a U.N. agency said.

But most experts say a doorway is not the best place to go during such an event. And a city website dedicated to being prepared for an earthquake echoes that view.

“Do not get in a doorway,” the site warns, “as this does not provide protection from falling or flying objects and you likely will not be able to remain standing.”

Keith Porter, a research professor in the Department of Civil Environmental and Architectural Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder, said the best advice from experts is to drop, cover and hold on (to the table or whatever other furniture you take shelter under).",mayor eric adams advised new yorkers take cover furniture doorway aftershocks experts say doorway best place go event,New York City,,TRV,224.52101135253906,226.86936950683594,226.57461547851562,219.94215393066406,1.0459413754419282,-0.1299223553012215,0.9146601084706626,-2.0393892733207744

While the fight for Ukraine’s capital is well known, researchers have developed a new tool to systematically document Russian attacks by using one of the most universal elements of the battlefield: the explosions that shook the earth.

Seismic waves were generated when Russia fired artillery, airstrikes and missiles across northern Ukraine. For the first time, researchers in Norway and Ukraine studied data from dozens of earthquake sensors around Kyiv, estimating the position and strength of each explosion to see the full extent of the Russian barrage.

There is no perfect way to chronicle a war, and the seismic record has gaps. Attacks farther from the sensors are most likely to be missed. A few of the explosions may have been set off by Ukraine.

Mr. Erdogan swept into power after a bungled government response to a 1999 earthquake that left more than 17,000 people dead and a financial crisis two years later. He has dominated Turkish politics for the two decades since — but his support has been weakened recently by sky-high inflation that dented his reputation as a capable, if controversial, administrator.

The earthquake “could really destroy the image of Erdogan as a powerful, autocratic, yet efficient leader,” said Soner Cagaptay, who heads Turkey research at the Washington Institute, a policy research organization. “We have to wait to see — it could play out depending on the disaster response.”

Mr. Erdogan, 68, faces a staggering task in the aftermath of Monday’s earthquake, which was one of the deadliest and most destructive natural disasters this century. Damage could top $1 billion, according to an estimate by the United States Geological Survey. Thousands are dead and the toll is rising.

He also faces a political challenge: Recent polls suggest that no one would win outright in the first round of presidential voting, and that either of two potential opposition candidates could beat Mr. Erdogan in a runoff, with survey margins ranging from single digits to more than 20 percentage points.

Turkish opponents and Western officials have accused Mr. Erdogan of pushing the country toward autocracy, largely because of sweeping powers he granted himself since a narrow majority of voters passed a referendum in 2017 that expanded the president’s role.

On Tuesday, he declared a three-month state of emergency in 10 provinces affected by the earthquake, allowing for limitations on freedoms that could include curfews, travel bans and compulsory assignment for civil servants.

The move raised immediate concerns, given the steps Mr. Erdogan took in 2016 after a failed coup attempt against him. A nationwide state of emergency was initially supposed to last three months but was extended for a total of two years. During that time, more than 100,000 people were detained and 150,000 public employees were purged from their jobs.

But analysts called Tuesday’s announcement an understandable step in light of the scale of the quake’s devastation. The three-month period would end shortly before the May 14 vote.

So far, the opposition has refrained from criticizing the response to the earthquake, with all the political parties on Tuesday issuing a rare joint statement of unity in the face of the temblor.",recep tayip erdogan swept power bungled government response 19 earthquake left 170 people dead dominated turkish politics two decades since support weakened recently,Turkey,,THYAO.IS,139.89999389648438,127.19999694824219,115.0,139.89999389648438,-9.077911009516729,-9.591192799482833,-17.798423861911335,0.0

But for some, the aftershocks can go on beyond the actual tremors: People can experience anxiety, sleep problems and other health issues in the hours and days after a quake.

One such effect is a sense of dizziness after an especially large or frightening earthquake. In Japan, this feeling is called jishin-yoi (which roughly translates to “earthquake drunk,” or “earthquake sickness”). It is also sometimes called post-earthquake dizziness syndrome. Others might report experiencing “phantom” earthquakes that might feel like subtle aftershocks, or like the room has started shaking again, but this is in fact purely psychological.

There is very little research into these phenomena, and most of it has been done in the wake of earthquakes far larger than the one that jolted the Northeast on Friday.

If that 19th-century storm hit today, all of this infrastructure would make it less likely to cause destruction. Still, the state is also far more developed — with bigger cities, more valuable farms and businesses, and many more people — which means the consequences could still be great.

If there’s good news to report in any of this, it’s that plenty of planners and policymakers are aware of the risks. As I wrote in The New York Times on Friday, the Department of Water Resources is planning to use the new scientific findings to update the state’s flood plans. With the help of supercomputers, they will map out in detail how all of that precipitation will flow through waterways and over land.

California is also working to strengthen levees in urban areas of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys to provide protection against 200-year storms, or those with a 0.5 percent chance of occurring in any year.

I found her leaning on a cane in a broken, empty plaza staring up at a midcentury building that the quake had somehow sheared horizontally so that it looked like a pot with its lid askew.

She asked for help.

From afar, we measure catastrophes like the calamity in Turkey and Syria by totaling the numbers of dead and buildings destroyed. Reports describe a spectacularly wide disaster zone, recovery efforts that are too slow, leaving untold hundreds and possibly thousands of victims still buried, alive and dead, under the rubble — and hundreds of thousands more in the cold without homes, food, drinking water or medical supplies.

Geophysicists and volcanologists say the quakes are the culmination of over a year of intense seismic activity, and although most of the tremors have lasted a few seconds, with light shaking, they have rattled residents in the capital, Reykjavik, just 20 miles north of the Reykjanes Peninsula where they have occurred.

“People in Reykjavik are waking up with an earthquake, others go to sleep with an earthquake,” said Thorvaldur Thordarson, a professor of volcanology at the University of Iceland. “There’s a lot of them, and that worries people, but there’s nothing to worry about, the world is not going to collapse.”

Earthquakes are common in Iceland because it straddles two of the Earth’s tectonic plates, the North American and Eurasian, which are divided by an undersea mountain chain, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The ridge oozes molten hot rock, or magma, from deeper in the Earth, forcing the plates to spread apart and causing quakes on the island.",180 earthquakes shaken area week scientists believe eruption could imminent tremors lasted seconds,Iceland,,ISB.IC,-3.0,-3.0,-3.0,-3.0,-3.0,-3.0,-3.0,-3.0

But if an earthquake of greater magnitude were to strike much closer to the city, the risk of serious damage could be relatively high.

The five boroughs are home to more than 200,000 multifamily buildings made with un-reinforced brick and built from the mid-1800s to the 1930s, according to a city hazard plan. Many rowhouses across the city neighborhoods fall into this category.

Such masonry cannot bend or flex during an earthquake and would instead break or crumble. A strong earthquake could cause some buildings of this type to collapse.

They Didn’t Have to Die Like This.’,2023-03-10,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/opinion/erdogan-turkey-earthquake.html,"Turkey, Istanbul, Erdogan","Erdogan’s rise to power after the 1999 Istanbul disaster was paralleled by a surge in civic activity. Many people felt abandoned by a paternalistic government. Turkish intellectuals and activists formed and bolstered their own civil society organizations aimed at helping one another through all manner of difficulties. A lot of the organizing was done by professional associations of architects and engineers and others worried about not just building safety but also the use of public space and the environmental impacts of the building frenzy that accompanied Erdogan’s rise. These groups did not want a new, paternalistic state to take the place of the old one. They wanted greater participation in a truly democratic civic sphere.

In Erdogan’s first decade in power, he was broadly hailed as a champion of openness and democracy. Turkey was seeking European Union membership and burnishing its democratic credentials. Erdogan emphasized freedom of religion, which had been repressed in the old secular regime, and freedom of expression. Most critically, he managed to contain Turkey’s military and all but eliminate its meddling in political life.

But ultimately Erdogan began refashioning the old centralized state as an even more powerful instrument that he alone could wield. Over the past decade, and with increasing speed since a 2016 coup plot was put down, Erdogan has squeezed civil society groups, brought the independent press to heel and prosecuted his political opponents. He has steadily accrued power, culminating in a 2017 referendum that moved Turkey from a parliamentary system to a strong executive system, giving him greater control over the judiciary and legislature.

He centralized disaster relief under a new government agency known as AFAD, and in a decision that calls to mind George W. Bush’s appointment of the head of the International Arabian Horse Association to lead FEMA two years before Hurricane Katrina, Erdogan named a theologian with little experience in disaster relief to head AFAD’s relief efforts, according to local media reports.

Erdogan has joined a growing club of elected autocrats who came to power in truly democratic elections only to slowly insulate themselves from political competition. For such men there is no need to declare oneself the leader for life — it is much better to follow the frog-in-boiling-water approach. Bit by bit, destroy the independence of institutions, civil society, the media. Drain the legislature of its oversight power. Bend the judiciary to your will. Use the law to remove popular competitors from the playing field of politics.

The island is almost certain to have dozens more quakes of magnitude 3 or higher, and there is a 63 percent chance of an earthquake of magnitude of 5 or higher.

Why are there so many earthquakes in Puerto Rico right now?

At about three times the size of Rhode Island, Puerto Rico is squeezed between the border of the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates.

The Puerto Rico Trench, north of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, is an undersea fault zone. The North American plate is sliding under the Caribbean plate there, creating the potential for earthquakes and undersea landslides that can set off tsunamis.

“We’re just as likely to have earthquakes as a place like California, Japan, New Zealand, Alaska,” said Elizabeth Vanacore, a seismologist with the Puerto Rico Seismic Network.

When the tectonic plates in the region slide past each other and squeeze together, energy and stress build up until one side of a fault pops up, unleashing an earthquake. The earthquakes redistribute stresses along the fault for a time, until those stresses build up again and new tremors occur.",puerto rico squeezed north american caribbean tectonic plates 63 percent chance earthquake magnitude 5 higher,California,,PCG,10.328606605529785,10.52761459350586,10.557467460632324,12.686871528625488,1.9267651056583783,0.28356724936416366,2.215796029834366,22.832362710311017

More than 100,000 people have had to abandon their homes during the past week, but since packing hundreds of refugees indoors at close quarters doesn’t conform to coronavirus guidelines, some are checking into guest-starved hotels. But lodging costs money, which is notably in short supply for too many people — especially with senators on vacation, speaking of making things worse.

And the California wine industry, already hurting at the hands of the pandemic, now faces the specter of “smoke taint” in grapes, few of which had been harvested before the fires started.

In San Francisco, where the twin-calamity challenge is more about tolerance than survival, disaster dissonance is also on display.

Because germs are better dispersed outside, and exercise is good for the mind and immune system, public parks filled up so fast that social distancing there was hard to maintain.

Still, it left many New Yorkers wondering how afraid they should be of a bigger one hitting closer to the city.

The answer? It’s hard to say.

Some news reports suggest that a large earthquake is “due” in New York City because moderate ones — with a magnitude of 5 or more — typically occur every few hundred years. The last one took place in the 1700s. Friday’s earthquake, in comparison, was a magnitude 4.8.

In 2008, Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory found that the risk of earthquakes in the New York City area was greater than previously believed. That is because smaller earthquakes occur regularly in New York City, like a magnitude 1.7 earthquake that was recorded in Astoria, Queens, in January.

Experts caution that it is impossible to know when an earthquake will strike or how much damage it might cause. But if an earthquake much stronger than Friday’s were to hit closer to New York City, “it would be a different story,” said Kishor S. Jaiswal, a research structural engineer with the U.S. Geological Survey.

This is just one survey, but it’s congruent with a lot of different data sources suggesting that Trump’s improvement with Hispanics in 2020, rather than an outlier that other Republicans won’t hit, represents a foundation on which the G.O.P. could potentially build further gains. Ruy Teixeira, the analyst whose famous “emerging Democratic majority” thesis (shared with John Judis) was welcomed and then misinterpreted by Democrats banking on the inevitable march of demographic change, has been particularly aggressive in warning about this scenario. In a recent post, he rattled off several polling results suggesting that Republicans could be moving close to parity in the Hispanic vote — a true political earthquake if it ever happened.

In the long-ago days of the George W. Bush presidency there was a lot of talk from pro-immigration Republicans about how Hispanics were “natural Republicans” — meaning family-oriented, religious, hardworking, in love with the American dream. But as the political parties were aligned in those days Hispanics fit pretty comfortably in the Democratic coalition. Even if they were more culturally conservative than white Democrats, they prioritized issues like health care and jobs and education and generally trusted the Democratic Party more on a range of domestic policy questions.

The Republican elites who imagined that they could make inroads with Hispanics by passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill weren’t completely out of touch, since there was often strong Hispanic support for that kind of measure. But the Republican Party’s core obstacle was always economic policy. Bush’s “compassionate conservatism” probably helped him to a relatively strong showing with Hispanics in 2004, although one overstated by flawed exit polls (he probably got about 39 percent, not the oft-quoted 44 percent). But thereafter the party moved right on economics, and the sequence of Bush’s push for Social Security privatization, the Tea Party’s anti-spending zeal and then the Romney-Ryan ticket’s promise of entitlement cuts all made the Republicans too economically libertarian to appeal to most Hispanics.

Since then, though, three crucial things have changed. First, the shape of immigration is different: Both legal and illegal immigration have become less Latin American and more global, and there has been a new pattern of rushes to the border by asylum-seekers who are more likely to come from Central America than Mexico. A simple story in which American Hispanics effectively saw themselves in every subsequent wave of migrants never quite fit reality, but for, say, a second-generation Mexican American in Texas, it fits the reality of 2021 less than the reality of 15 years ago.",longago days george w bush presidency lot talk proimigration republicans hispanics natural republicans republican partys core obstacle always economic policy,Texas,,CNP,25.53797721862793,25.78582763671875,25.684850692749023,25.262584686279297,0.9705170302604588,-0.39159861530268064,0.5751178837060016,-1.078364703637357

The building is a reminder of how much Taiwan has prepared for disasters like the magnitude-7.4 earthquake that jolted the island on Wednesday. Perhaps because of improvements in building codes, greater public awareness and highly trained search-and-rescue operations — and, likely, a dose of good luck — the casualty figures were relatively low. By Thursday, 10 people had died and more than 1,000 others were injured. Several dozen were missing.

“Similar level earthquakes in other societies have killed far more people,” said Daniel Aldrich, a director of the Global Resilience Institute at Northeastern University. Of Taiwan, he added: “And most of these deaths, it seems, have come from rock slides and boulders, rather than building collapses.”",buildings closest city hualien swayed rocked 300 aftershocks rocked island next 24 hours thursday morning part stood,Taiwan,9543.0,TSM,140.04083251953125,137.7331085205078,139.40965270996094,140.55364990234375,-1.6478936589452104,1.2172412337615217,-0.45071126628891106,0.36619132690529976

It also happens to sit on several active faults, making it prone to earthquakes.

The county has a population of about 300,000, according to the 2020 census, about a third of whom live in the coastal city of Hualien, the county seat. It is one of the most sparsely populated parts of Taiwan. About three hours by train from the capital, Taipei, the city describes itself as the first place on the island that’s touched by the sun.

Hualien County is home to Taroko National Park, one of Taiwan’s most popular scenic areas. Visitors come to explore the Taroko Gorge, a striated marble canyon carved by the Liwu River, which cuts through mountains that rise steeply from the coast. The city of Hualien is a popular destination as a gateway to the national park.

According to the state-owned Central News Agency, three hikers were trapped on a trail near the entrance to the gorge on Wednesday, after the quake sent rocks falling. Two of them were found dead, the news agency said. Administrators said many roads within the park had been cut off by the earthquake, potentially trapping hikers, according to the report.

Earthquakes have rattled Hualien with some regularity. In 2018, 17 people were killed and hundreds of others injured when a magnitude 6.5 quake struck just before midnight, its epicenter a short distance northeast of the city of Hualien.

One of those aftershocks, which struck about nine hours after the initial quake, was nearly as strong as the first and measured at magnitude 7.5. Powerful aftershocks like that can add to the destruction, shaking buildings and infrastructure that have already been badly weakened by the initial quake.

The 7.5 aftershock was well above average, and was about one-third as powerful as the 7.8 quake. From statistical analyses of quakes worldwide, the most powerful aftershock Monday would have been expected to be about magnitude 6.8, or only about one-thirtieth as powerful as the first quake.

“There’s nothing magic about aftershock magnitude,” said Susan Hough, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey. Sometimes an aftershock is even larger than the initial quake, Dr. Hough said, in which case the aftershock is considered the main quake and the first one is referred to as a foreshock.

Aftershocks can occur on the same fault as the main earthquake, or on nearby faults that are affected by the stress changes. This aftershock was centered about 60 miles north of the initial quake.

Aftershocks also can continue to occur for weeks or months following a strong quake, with their frequency and strength gradually declining.

The earthquakes on Monday occurred on the East Anatolian Fault Zone, part of a complex system of faults in Turkey that make the region one of the most seismically active in the world. Another fault zone, the North Anatolian, has caused many large earthquakes, including a 1999 quake centered about 60 miles from Istanbul that killed more than 15,000 people.

All of these are strike-slip faults, meaning the blocks of crust move horizontally relative to one another when strains between them reach a breaking point. Dr. Hough said that given the magnitude of the first quake on Monday, it’s likely that the movement occurred along 120 miles or so of the fault.

After the initial break, near Gaziantep in south central Turkey, the rupture would have propagated along the fault at about 2 miles a second, Dr. Hough said. This would help account for the lengthy shaking, which some witnesses said lasted for 90 seconds or longer.

Large strike-slip fault zones on land are not common , Dr. Hough said; the San Andreas Fault in California is another example. But those on land can be extremely destructive, because they tend to be close to population centers, and they can be fairly shallow, increasing the shaking felt at the surface.

Some quakes are centered more than a hundred miles below the surface, but the initial shock on Monday occurred at a depth of about 11 miles.

In some cases the destruction from strike-slip earthquakes is more widespread than from larger quakes that occur in so-called subduction zones, where one large crustal plate is sliding beneath another. Subduction zones, like those that exist around the rim of the Pacific Ocean, are usually offshore and tremors occur at greater depth. Most of the destruction in those cases often comes from a tsunami, as occurred in the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan.",75 aftershock well average onethird powerful 78 quake powerful aftershocks like add destruction shaking buildings infrastructure,California,,PCG,15.473008155822754,15.582463264465332,15.562562942504883,15.502860069274902,0.7073938534788939,-0.12770973127098875,0.5787807114185998,0.1929289582964167

Amid the turmoil, a young, charismatic politician rode a wave of public anger to become prime minister in 2003.

That politician was Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Now, as president, Mr. Erdogan faces challenges similar to those that brought down his predecessors — posing what is perhaps the greatest threat of his two decades in power to his political future.

The deadliest earthquake to strike Turkey in almost a century killed at least 21,000 people this past week, with the bodies of countless others still buried in the rubble. It hit after a year of persistently high inflation that has impoverished Turkish families, leaving many with scarce resources to bounce back.

The quake’s aftermath has highlighted how much Mr. Erdogan has reshaped the Turkish state, analysts said. Critics accuse him of pushing the country toward autocracy by weakening civil rights and eroding the independence of state institutions, like the Foreign Ministry and the central bank.

Alp Toker, the director of NetBlocks, said Wednesday that the coordinated nature of the block suggested that it was likely the result of a government order. He said network data indicated that the block was being done with software installed by telecommunications providers that can prevent specific websites and services from loading.

NetBlocks later said that by Thursday morning network activity appeared to show that access to Twitter had been restored.

Turkey has a history of imposing social media restrictions during emergencies and major safety incidents.

In October, Turkey’s Parliament passed sweeping legislation in an effort to crack down on disinformation. As part of the measure, social media companies must remove content and provide proprietary information to the authorities if requested to do so. Companies that do not comply could face a slowdown in the speed of their services in Turkey.

Asked about reports of problems accessing Twitter, Vice President Fuat Oktay attributed those difficulties to “some technical problems” during a news conference about relief efforts.

Officials from Twitter and the Turkish government met later, Anadolu News Agency, the state news service, reported. Omer Fatih Sayan, the Turkish deputy minister of transportation and infrastructure, reminded senior Twitter officials “Twitter’s responsibility in fighting disinformation,” Anadolu reported.

Or perhaps even objects created by prehistoric human populations?

Researchers studying sand spikes found in California and Germany have now proposed that these geological oddities form rapidly during intense ground shaking. Powerful seismic waves — triggered by either earthquakes or asteroid impacts — ripple through sand and create these features in mere seconds, the team suggests. When sand spikes are found, they say, they can be used to pinpoint both the timing and location of long-ago seismic cataclysms.

Despite the striking appearance of sand spikes — which have “the shape and proportions of an ancient mace,” a researcher wrote in 1906 — they aren’t well known, even among scientists who study rocks.

Komaru is mourning his separation from his wife, Kyoko (Shoshana Wilder), who spent hours watching televised news coverage of the disaster before walking out on him. We learn through flashbacks that the two got together under peculiar circumstances. Katagari, meanwhile, has an absurd meeting with an anthropomorphic frog named Frog (voiced by Földes), who tasks him with saving the city from a second impending earthquake caused by a giant earthworm.

Despite its original, unusual premise, “Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman” can’t shake the sense that it is multiple short stories stitched together, and the elusive nature of Murakami’s dialogue and characterizations does it no favors. It works well as a visual companion for fans of the author’s work, and as a flawed enigma for everyone else.

The government issued arrest warrants for more than 100 people across the 10 provinces affected by the quake, the state-run Anadolu News Agency reported on Saturday, as the Turkish Justice Ministry ordered officials in those provinces to set up “Earthquake Crimes Investigation Units.” It also directed them to appoint prosecutors to bring criminal charges against all the “constructors and those responsible” for the collapse of buildings that failed to meet existing codes, which had been put in place after a similar disaster in 1999.

At least four people were arrested on Saturday. The legal actions constituted the first steps by the Turkish state toward identifying and punishing people who may have contributed to the deaths of their fellow citizens in the quake.

Before the devastation, which also left millions homeless, Turkey was already reeling from a collapsing currency and runaway inflation that had reached an annual rate of 85 percent in October. Those vulnerabilities have punched holes in the nation’s balance sheet and tipped Turkish families and businesses into a cost-of-living crisis.

The film speaks the same cinematic language, employing an ethereal, emotive color palette that enlivens every splash of water and blade of grass.

You can spot Miyazaki’s influence in more than just the visuals. There are familiar symbols and themes: The portal doors, the cursed male hero and a few narrative moves in the resolution all scream Miyazaki’s “Howl’s Moving Castle,” while the exploration of memory and grief mirrors his “Spirited Away.”

I’ll stop the Miyazaki comparisons there because Shinkai showcases plenty of his own narrative and directorial signatures in “Suzume.” He’s created a thoroughly modern world of both old and new forms of magic, of spells and old gods and of Instagram posts and texts. Like a locomotive chugging uphill, the story’s stakes are quickly raised to the scale of natural disasters and mythical phenomena, while Shinkai puts an emphasis on specific towns and regions in Japan, grounding us in the real world even as he whisks us away to other worlds.

What’s particularly exciting in “Suzume” is the story’s start. Seventeen-year-old Suzume wakes up from an otherworldly dream and heads off to school. On the way, she encounters and tries to follow a mysterious stranger named Souta but ends up in the ruins of an old resort, where she stumbles upon a free-standing door floating in a shallow bank of water. She opens it, and soon flaring wind, flying debris and massive red tendrils reach out and consume the darkening skies of Japan. This is only 10 minutes in.

Then the wave hit. Time stopped. And the village became history.

MICHAEL: Tell me about how this story, the story that’s at the center of that paragraph, and how it first came to you.

JON: Well, I guess it was in 2003. I was traveling with a friend of mine through the redwoods in California. And we were in a town called Crescent City, which is right at the Oregon-California border.

We were having breakfast at this diner in town, and all around the restaurant were historical photographs, black and white photographs of the town just destroyed, you know, wreckage of buildings. There had been a tsunami there. And while we were looking at these photographs, a waitress at the diner – this older woman, almost like something out of a movie – walked by. She must have seen us looking at the pictures, and without saying a word, she slid this old book across the table at us and just walked on.

The book was an oral history of this tsunami in 1964, people’s accounts and photographs of how the town was more or less obliterated, and how they came together to help each other out of that disaster. And I was riveted by that. There was something that was really moving and peculiar to me about a small town facing a challenge like that. But I just tucked it away in my mind as something that one day I might like to learn more about.

I guess I was out of story ideas at some point and was sitting at my kitchen table and finally just Googled it. Turns out that the tsunami was an effect of this enormous earthquake that had happened in Alaska. It’s called the Great Alaska Earthquake, which I had never heard of before.

MICHAEL: I have to be honest, I’ve never heard about it either, which is a little embarrassing. I mean, the idea that there was a massive earthquake in the United States, it’s kind of not present in our heads.

At 11:30 p.m. local time, an eruption began at Mauna Loa’s summit, inside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Lava flowing from the volcano was confined to the summit area, moving in the early hours of the morning to a rift zone on the northeast side.

That journey is exactly what was behind the concept of the museum when it opened in 2004. It is funded by two corporations, the Eczacibasi Group and Dogus Group-Bilgili Holding. Construction of the new building began in 2018 (its cost is undisclosed). It was always the museum founders’ plan to return the institution to its waterfront home.

“The main idea for this building has always been transparency from the ground floor, and the idea is to connect the sea and the park behind the museum with the park’s buildings from the 16th, 18th and 19th centuries,” said Umit Mesci, a curator at the Istanbul Modern. “In this transparent ground floor, it was about making everything free and open to the public: the library, cafe and educational areas.”

For Mr. Piano, the Istanbul Modern was all about its location, and he wanted to celebrate the building’s scrappy origins as a warehouse in his new design, with its facade of aluminum panels, along a waterfront area that has been transformed in the last several years with restaurants and luxury hotels. But the inspiration came more from the natural setting.

“I love a building by the water because water makes things beautiful,” Mr. Piano said in a recent phone interview from his home in Paris. “And the Istanbul Modern is about a dialogue between the building and the water.”

There were also some very practical considerations, including safety in an earthquake zone — a design element made even more urgent since the devastation in southern Turkey and northern Syria from February’s earthquake.

The quake was very shallow, occurring at a depth of only six miles, according to official records. Shallow quakes can often be more destructive than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, losing less energy along the way.

“We thought that as long as nothing bad happened, it’s fine,” Ms. Kasahara, 45, said.

After the disaster 11 years ago at a nuclear power station in Fukushima, where an earthquake and tsunami led to a triple meltdown, Japan took most of its nuclear plants offline. Now, Ms. Kasahara, spooked by security breaches and damaged infrastructure at the power station near her home, wants it shuttered for good.

Ms. Kasahara symbolizes the long road Japan faces as Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, confronting threats to fuel supplies posed by the Ukraine war and vowing urgent action to reduce carbon emissions, intensifies efforts to reboot the country’s nuclear power network.

Riordan, a Queens-born lawyer, businessman and former mayor of Los Angeles who led the city at a particularly divisive time and brought a free-enterprise approach to rebuilding the city’s infrastructure after a devastating earthquake in 1994, died on Wednesday at his home in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles. He was 92.

His daughter Patricia Riordan Torrey confirmed his death.

Mr. Riordan, whose unfiltered speech occasionally got him into trouble, began his career in business and turned to politics later in life. He was elected mayor in 1993, in his first effort at electoral politics, and served until 2001, prevented by term limits from seeking a third term.

Before that, he was a shrewd investor who turned a modest inheritance into a large personal fortune. He was a venture capitalist in the 1960s, before such investors had acquired that name, and gave his own money away well before philanthropy came into vogue among California’s newly wealthy.

A moderate Republican, Mr. Riordan came to politics in 1992, when it became clear that Tom Bradley, the Democratic five-term incumbent mayor, would not seek re-election. Mr. Riordan, then 62, was encouraged by friends to run, in part because of his solid ties across the political spectrum.

Diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and China escalated as the U.S. tried to explain its downing of three unidentified flying objects over the weekend and China accused the U.S. of sending its own unauthorized high-altitude balloons over Chinese airspace.

A White House official said the flying objects had posed a threat to civilian aircraft even though the military had not identified their purpose. The objects were not sending out communications signals, and there was no indication that Americans on the ground were in danger, he said.

In a jab at Washington, China’s foreign ministry said that it was “common” for U.S. balloons to illegally enter the airspace of other nations and that U.S. high-altitude balloons had flown over China without permission more than 10 times since last year. The U.S. denied the claim.

The latest exchange is yielding insights into China’s ambitions for balloons in “near space,” a part of the atmosphere that is too high for most planes to stay aloft in for very long and too low for space satellites.

What Do We Know About The Risks?,2024-11-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/climate/landslides-rain-climate-explainer.html,"California, Alaska, Washington, Wrangell","One way to find coverage is through a separate line item called difference-in-conditions. Such insurance could cost up to $15,000 a year, according to a report by RAND Corporation, and the quotes are notoriously difficult to find, especially after a community has already faced a landslide.

Experts say the dearth in insurance is largely because the risk is so difficult to predict and the marketplace of people requesting the insurance is so small.

The lack of insurance access has led some communities at a higher risk for landslides to push back against hazard maps that could better protect them because they don’t want to lower the value of their homes or prevent development. People who’ve lost homes, cars or other property to landslides can suffer a total loss, and some can still be on the hook to pay back the mortgage for a house that no longer exists.

What is the federal government doing to address the problem?

In 2021, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican, along with Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, a Democrat, introduced the National Landslide Preparedness Act. It provided more funding for the United States Geological Survey to map the hazards, improve forecasting and set up landslide hazard offices in states across the country.

In November, as the Pacific Northwest faced its first atmospheric river of the season, Sen. Murkowski, along with California Senator Alex Padilla, introduced a bill to improve forecasting of atmospheric rivers that could help reduce flood risks and bolster emergency preparedness.

Two of the opposition parties are headed by high-profile former members of the A.K.P. One of them, Ali Babacan, devised the party’s earlier economic policies. The other, Ahmet Davutoglu, is widely credited with its approach to foreign policy. Under these two figures, the A.K.P. in the 2000s deepened and popularized the country’s market-friendly and pro-Western orientation.

But a return to this approach is simply not possible in the 2020s. Economically, the global climate is far less favorable to the kind of free market economics, relying on foreign direct investment, high interest rates and trade liberalization, of the A.K.P.’s first decade in power. Geopolitically, the European Union’s stance on Turkey’s accession has changed — more or less ruling it out — and in the wider region, American military and diplomatic hegemony can no longer be counted on.

The government already knew as much. The shift away from Mr. Babacan’s market-friendly policies was effectively enforced by a contraction in world markets a decade ago. On the international relations front, a primary reason for Mr. Davutoglu’s resignation as prime minister in 2016 was that the governing party no longer found a pro-Western approach to be profitable. With Russian and Chinese influence in the region growing, the A.K.P. decided to hedge its bets, without abandoning its Western allies completely.

In recent years, the A.K.P. pragmatically resorted to a number of tools to manage the economy. It didn’t always go well. Yet despite the party’s blunders, what allowed the A.K.P. to hang on to power was a wide and sturdy popular base of support. That base was built through five decades of work that melded face-to-face interaction and informal ties — helping people organize community events, for example, or acting as mediators in neighborhood conflicts — with formal party and associational membership. In power, the shaky but real benefits of the A.K.P.’s ever-shifting mix and match of market-oriented and statist policies cemented these ties with the people.

One reason behind the A.K.P.’s persistent appeal is that — with the exception of the Kurdish movement and its small socialist allies — no political force in the country has tried to build such a widespread rapport with communities. Without a clear alternative to the status quo, many people will stick with the political leadership they know. The recent promises of redistribution made by Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the presidential challenger to Mr. Erdogan and the leader of the Republican People’s Party, are hardly enough to break the A.K.P.’s stranglehold on society.",opposition parties headed highprofile former members akp shift away ali babacans marketfriendly policies effectively enforced contraction world markets decade ago,Turkey,,THYAO.IS,126.80000305175781,136.3000030517578,132.60000610351562,124.4000015258789,7.492113384352401,-2.714597846954685,4.574134788774682,-1.8927456373161617

The graph in question does not match the seismic data that Penn State recorded in the Philadelphia area Tuesday night, according to Wesley Robinson, the press secretary of the university’s department of conservation and natural resources. Robinson also said the graph did not match the records of the United States Geological Survey.

“There have been reports in the past of seismic noise generated from sporting events,” Kyle Homman, the seismic network manager at Penn State, said via email. “However, most of the reports I have seen highlight stations that are very close to the stadium.”

Homman said that he had seen shaking on the university’s seismometers during Penn State football games, but that was a result of the device being only two miles from Beaver Stadium. In the case of Citizens Bank Park, the seismometers in question are 15 to 20 miles away, which would require far more noise or movement to register.

The Twitter user was probably attempting to mislead people — the post had its replies limited, a tactic sometimes used so misinformation cannot be easily outed as false — and there has been speculation online that the chart in question came from a recent 5.1-magnitude earthquake in California.

In 1998, Mr. Erdogan, then Istanbul’s 44-year-old mayor, was a rising star of Turkey’s Islamist political movement — which was the target of a crackdown by the military-backed authorities.

The new island is the product of an unnamed undersea volcano that began erupting on Oct. 21, less than a mile from Iwo Jima, the island in Japan where American and Japanese forces waged a fierce battle during World War II.

No injuries or damages have been reported on Iwo Jima, hundreds of miles from Tokyo in the Pacific Ocean, since the ongoing eruption began. The eruption is offering an eye-opening real-time view of a rare geological phenomenon.

earthquake,Why Are We Obsessed With the Destruction of L.A.?,2023-09-12,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/12/magazine/los-angeles-destruction.html,"California, L.A., Eden","Wrathful, extremely online conservative Christians crowed the loudest. For them the flooding was ordained by God, a sign that they were vindicated in a running feud with the team. Incensed at the club’s decision to honor the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence — a California-based charity organization made up of drag performers parodying Catholic nuns — during its annual Pride celebration, the religious activists made the Dodgers a national example of what is, in their view, secular society’s disrespect for Christianity. Marco Rubio wrote a public letter to the M.L.B. commissioner complaining that the club was honoring “a group that mocks Christians through diabolical parodies”; Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, compared it to inviting a group of blackface minstrels to perform. For many of these conservatives, the ultimate decision to host the Sisters earned the Dodgers a special place in hell. X users with names like Spunky Conservative Patriot denounced the club, proclaiming “God Wins!” and spinning the incident as divine justice, a reboot of Noah’s Ark, the original disaster narrative.

None of these people stopped to investigate whether the stadium had actually flooded. It turned out that the lake was an optical illusion, about as real as Carpenter’s backlot visions of an annihilated Southern California. The next day, the Dodgers’ official X and Instagram accounts posted images of a dry and sunny scene at the ballpark. The Los Angeles Times explained that the original image depicted nothing but a wet parking lot reflecting gray light, which made it impossible to judge the depth of the water on the surface. More geographically perceptive people pointed out that the stadium sits on top of a hill, from which water would sluice back down into the city’s basin. The idea that a moat could form up there defied physics.

In the end, though, disaster movies are never about the imagined cataclysms they claim to be about. They’re the stories we tell ourselves about how we got where we are — and how we might trace our steps back to Eden. For example, the 1974 Charlton Heston vehicle “Earthquake” traffics in images of exploding Craftsman homes and frightened white residents, like a nightmare vision of what the 1965 Watts riots (and countless other late 1960s race riots) could have been like, if the L.A.P.D. and the National Guard had not contained it to Black neighborhoods. In the movies, L.A. is the place where everything goes wrong; at least the rest of the nation can take lessons from its failures.

Historically, film as a medium has, for better or worse, helped us make sense of the world. This is not to say that schlock like “Escape From L.A.” is instructional, but it’s an entry in the visual and verbal library from which we draw in order to parse life’s moral, political and personal challenges. How, I wonder, does the new visual language of social media train us to understand the world? Just as disaster flicks are never really about the supposed calamity they depict, that clip of Dodger Stadium is less about climate change, religious course correction or the crisis of urban planning than how far we’ve slid into this new, confused discourse, like so much muddy storm water sloshing down into the gutter. The images that circulate on platforms like X (a virtual disaster zone) encourage us to extrapolate erroneous conclusions from a cascade of often conflicting clips that are ultimately meaningless outside their initial contexts. This is not new — from “Birth of a Nation” to “Nanook of the North,” film’s history is entangled with the question of how we tell fact from fiction. Now, as then, we would do well to discern when we’re only looking at projections.

Among the casualties of the blast were 72 glass vessels, eight of which have been restored at the British Museum as a result of a grant from the TEFAF Museum Restoration Fund.

About a mile east, the Arab Image Foundation also suffered terrible damage, including to storage spaces where photography collections were kept. There, Cultural Emergency Response helped repair windows, secure storage spaces, and ensure that the foundation and its collections had survived.

“Usually people think about heritage as just being historical buildings or collections,” Ms. Letschert explained. “Heritage is part of a wider ecosystem of culture.”

When an earthquake hit Turkey and Syria in February, killing more than 50,000 people, the organization intervened, supporting teams on the ground to document the damage and the threats to buildings, sites, collections and cultural spaces, and figuring out “what we can do, what the priorities are and who we can work with,” Ms. Letschert said. She added that the organization had raised about $290,000 for the rescue effort and was processing applications from partner organizations that are wanting to help.

Today, there is less for Cultural Emergency Response to do in the Middle East because so many other cultural preservation bodies are involved in rescuing the area’s cultural sites, Ms. Letschert said. The organization’s priority is to “go where others are not going and try to serve areas and communities that are often overlooked.”

As David Bernstein, a law professor at George Mason University, contends in his 2012 book, “Rehabilitating Lochner,” proponents of a freedom of contract were “originalists, trying to adhere to what they saw as the constitutional underpinnings of the 14th Amendment’s framers.”

The case for Lochner is plainly embedded in the Dobbs decision. Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that rights not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution had to be “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” Unlike a right to abortion, freedom of contract is widely believed to meet that definition.

Since the Declaration of Independence was adopted 246 years ago, the freedom to work and to make contracts has been seen as part of the “inalienable rights” of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” The founders drew on the work of the English philosopher John Locke, who identified “life, liberty and property” as inalienable rights and considered ownership of the self a form of property. The 14th Amendment echoes Locke’s language: “nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.”

In fact, the notion that citizens had a basic right to enter into contracts, especially regarding their trade or employment, was so pervasive by the time the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868 that Lochner barely discussed it. The opinion simply asserted that those bakery workers in New York had a right to make a contract as “part of the liberty of the individual protected by the 14th Amendment.”

The right to enter into contracts, even in Lochner, was not all-encompassing. The legitimate exercise of the state’s police powers trumped a right of contract. People couldn’t enter into illegal arrangements, and the state was free to protect the health and safety of workers. Lochner explicitly upheld regulations protecting miners, whose work was inherently unsafe. But the court found nothing inherently dangerous about baking.",lochner upheld regulations protecting miners whose work inherently unsafe justice samuel alito said rights explicitly mentioned constitution deeply rooted nations history tradition,New York,,TRV,161.9503936767578,158.1849822998047,160.73941040039062,160.48397827148438,-2.3250399653048297,1.6148360378133644,-0.7477495107447713,-0.9054719608772948

Trump’s strictest immigration policies, which was interpreted by many as a sign that the United States would be more welcoming to migrants. In May, the administration extended temporary protected status for the 150,000 Haitians already living in the country. But tens of thousands have attempted to cross into the United States since then despite not qualifying for the program.

“False information, misinformation and misunderstanding might have created a false sense of hope,” said Guerline M. Jozef, the executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, an organization that works with migrants.

Mr. Biden’s term has coincided with a sharp deterioration in the political and economic stability of Haiti, leaving parts of its capital under the control of gangs and forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes. The assassination of Haiti’s president and a magnitude 7.2 earthquake this summer have only added to the pressures causing people to leave the country. Shortly after the assassination, hundreds of Haitians flocked to the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, many carrying packed suitcases and small children, after false rumors spread on social media that the Biden administration was handing out humanitarian visas to Haitians in need.

Most of the Haitians in Mexico — a country that has intercepted nearly 4,000 this year — were not coming directly from Haiti, but from South America, where, like Mackenson, they had already been living and working, according to a top official in the Mexican foreign ministry. The number of Haitians heading northward across the border that separates Colombia and Panama — often by traversing the treacherous jungle known as the Darién Gap — has also surged in recent years, increasing from just 420 in 2018 to more than 42,300 through August of this year, according to the Panamanian government.",tens thousands haitians tried enter us since president biden took office administration extended temporary protected status 150 haitians living country,the United States,,TRV,145.4755859375,142.0967559814453,142.3853302001953,143.69772338867188,-2.3226096215940446,0.2030829041499592,-2.1242435405156845,-1.222103720958333

Southwest is the state’s busiest airline, and more of its flights depart from California than from any other state in the nation, including Texas, where the company began. Southwest is the top airline at seven of California’s 10 busiest airports, accounting for more than half of all air traffic at the airports in Oakland, Sacramento, San Jose, Burbank and Long Beach.

“Southwest is almost the unofficial airline of California,” Henry Harteveldt, an airlines analyst for Atmosphere Research Group, told my colleague Shawn Hubler after the airline’s flight cancellations during the holidays left passengers stranded across the country.

By Friday, the airline appeared to be back on track. But as Shawn and I recently wrote, Southwest’s highly publicized woes have rattled the confidence of travelers and commuters who rely on the airline to shuttle between Northern and Southern California. Despite mild winter weather, California’s medium-size airports had some of the worst cancellation rates in the nation last week because Southwest accounts for so much of their traffic.

Going forward, “just because the flights are operating, doesn’t mean the customers will be there,” Harteveldt, who is based in San Francisco, said. “I think this event has weakened trust among travelers and done substantial damage to Southwest’s brand.”",southwest states busiest airline flights depart california state nation southwest top airline seven californias 10 busiest airports,California,,PCG,-3.0,15.602364540100098,15.801372528076172,15.681968688964844,-3.0,1.275498899314895,-3.0,-3.0

The building, Crestview Towers, was built in 1972 and had submitted a recertification report, based on a January inspection, that documented “unsafe structural and electrical conditions.”

Ms. Levine Cava said the top priority at Champlain Towers South remained the search for survivors, but on Friday, it was four additional victims who were found, including the body of the 7-year-old daughter of a Miami firefighter. Police officers, firefighters and emergency medical workers paused the search to pay their respects and flank her removal from the scene.

The police did not identify the girl but confirmed the deaths of Bonnie Epstein, 56, and the married couple Maria Obias-Bonnefoy, 69, and Claudio Bonnefoy, 85, raising the known death toll to 22. As many as 126 people are still unaccounted for, a number that was revised down after officials determined that some people included in the tally had been located.

Rescuers and emergency medical workers refused to abandon hope, even as they acknowledged that it dwindled with each day. People have survived for many days after building collapses elsewhere, as seen after earthquakes in Haiti and Mexico. Additional urban search-and-rescue teams, activated by FEMA this week, headed down to Surfside to help assist with the search efforts and preparations for the incoming hurricane.

Everything, except for one thing: the mysterious deep-sea creature that had washed up on the shore.

“What is that?” Alison Laferriere recalled thinking. She saw something long and skinny on the beach while walking her dog: “It looked like it could be some garbage or something.”

But when she got closer, Ms. Laferriere, a doctorate student at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, recognized the find immediately. She had a rare close-up view of the oarfish, a striking creature from the depths of the ocean that has eluded researchers over the decades.

In other words, our extremes are becoming more extreme.

For a recent issue of The New York Times Magazine, Christopher Cox tackled the question of how extreme weather could threaten California’s dams, an essential piece of the state’s complicated water storage and distribution system.

California is home to the tallest dam in America, located 60 miles north of Sacramento in Oroville. A failure of that dam would be catastrophic; in one particularly alarming scenario, it would send a wave more than 185 feet tall sweeping into the valley below, inundating several towns. When the St. Francis Dam in northern Los Angeles County failed in 1928, the disaster was one of the deadliest in state history.

But in a state threatened so regularly by Mother Nature, the risk of flooding from a dam failure doesn’t tend to get much attention.

These houses are made from everything: cardboard boxes, scrap wood, vinyl sheets, discarded books, old telephone booths, reed screens. They’re furnished with art and some are equipped with electrical appliances powered by solar generators.

While some of these dwellings may violate local laws, Japan’s powerful constitution, which guarantees human rights and minimum standards of living, protects them and their builders. Through these houses, Sakaguchi saw a different way of thinking about architecture, and embarked on a full-fledged study.

Sakaguchi published a guide and an appreciation in the form of a photographic essay book, “Zero Yen House,” in 2004 showcasing the varied designs, and later held exhibitions and talks in Philadelphia, Berkeley, Calif., Nairobi, Kenya, as well as in Vancouver and Banff, Canada. The range of styles is remarkable: a mobile cardboard home built on a wooden cart, a house made out of a discarded playground slide, and even a house that incorporates a Shinto shrine. He went on to make videos on how to build your own mobile house.

“Sakaguchi’s work is part of a larger movement of artists responding to precarious and unsustainable aspects of Japanese society, as experienced in the cycles of boom, bust, and natural disasters over the past few decades,” said Jennifer Pastore, an editor for the art news site Tokyo Art Beat. The architect Shigeru Ban, for example, is well known for his temporary shelter and disaster housing. After Fukushima, Sakaguchi refurbished a crumbling house in Kumamoto as refugee housing and called it the “Zero Center.” At one point, 30-40 families displaced from Fukushima were living there.

“These houses are built on a shoestring budget by diverting and recycling the rubbish thrown away on the street,” Sakaguchi wrote for a 2006 exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery. “In this respect, these houses are built out of the resourcefulness of human nature, not by purchasing power.”",sakaguchi started pay attention people living streets tokyo building houses houses made everything cardboard boxes scrap wood vinyl sheets discarded books old telephone booths,Calif.,,PCG,10.676873207092285,10.796279907226562,11.104743957519531,11.283853530883789,1.1183676889125134,2.857132761873803,4.007453700424446,5.6850007677182814

To find the most and least safe places in the United States, a new study by WalletHub scored 182 cities (including at least two of the largest in each state) across three categories of metrics. The “home and community safety” category examined crime statistics, police and rescue workers per capita, traffic and pedestrian safety, among other data. “Financial safety” scored each city on employment, job security, credit ratings, savings rates and the like. And the “natural disaster” category considered the risk of floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hail, hurricanes and wildfires.

Drilling down to some individual metrics helps paint a clearer picture. In the home and community safety category, Irvine, Calif., was found to have the fewest assaults per capita, though its heightened risk of natural disasters dropped it to 33rd overall. On the other end of the list, Little Rock, Ark., St. Louis, Detroit, Birmingham, Ala., Kansas City, Mo., and Memphis tied for the most assaults per capita — 86 times higher than in Irvine.

For natural disasters, the capital city of Dover, Del. — near the coast but tucked inland — had the lowest risk, but poor scores in home and financial safety sank it to 81st overall.

What the U.S. owes Haiti is what it’s already giving: legal and forensic aid to investigate last week’s assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. Two Haitian Americans reportedly participated in carrying out the plot. Christian Emmanuel Sanon, a Haitian-born doctor based in Florida, has been arrested in Haiti on allegations that he ordered the assassination to make himself president. Former Colombian soldiers suspected of belonging to the hit squad had been hired by CTU Security, a firm based near Miami and run by a Venezuelan émigré.

But if U.S. authorities can help Haiti establish the facts about Moïse’s murder, they cannot help the country change the facts that led up to it — the endemic corruption, rampant lawlessness and institutional decay that have long crippled Haiti, and that make nearly every form of foreign assistance not only useless but also harmful.

That starts with the military intervention that the interim prime minister, Claude Joseph, requested of Washington.

Such will is what defines Los Angeles as a city and Southern California as a region. You might say the same of the entire state. The will to persist, to hold the perimeter, to keep moving into a future that’s uncertain, in a physical environment that, out of nowhere, can become catastrophically harsh.

Many of the homegrown Californians I know recognize this, but it was one of the first, and most important, lessons I as a transplant had to learn. It came in research for a book about earthquakes I was writing at least in part to alleviate my fear of them. At the time, I had the impression that, if I had enough information, I could tame my anxiety about the state’s brittle geology. What I discovered, however, was the opposite: that to live in California meant to understand that disaster could strike at any instant, which is to say that there is nothing we can count on, nothing that will guarantee safe passage through the world.

The only solution is to assess your risks and keep on living. That is what Southern California teaches everyone. It’s not a trade-off that to live amid such beauty requires recompense. No, it is something like an acceptance, or even an embrace, of everything we cannot and will never know.

For me, such a dynamic is essential in connecting us to place, to landscape; it is a crucible in which belonging is forged. I became an Angeleno in the wake of the Northridge earthquake and the disruptions of the early 1990s: the Rodney King riots, the 1993 Malibu wildfires. I began to understand the stakes of living there. Such events resonate as a set of shared inflection points, bringing me together with my fellow Southern Californians and, as it must be, with the region itself.

I also remember the midsummer night in 2013, when my wife and I drove two hours from Los Angeles to Hemet, to retrieve our then-14-year-old daughter, who had been evacuated from camp because of an out-of-control wildfire.

Over the past several weeks, over 9,000 migrants, mostly from Haiti, have been camping out at the U.S. and Mexico border in hopes of entering the United States. Last week, after the release of images and video of U.S. Border Patrol agents on horseback grabbing and chasing down Haitian migrants, the U.S. began deporting Haitian individuals and families. They are returning to a country that is still reeling from a series of crises, including the assassination of its president in July, an earthquake in August and political infighting and food scarcity.

In this lesson, you will learn about the continuing journey of those trying to migrate. Then, you will engage in a discussion about immigration policy.

Warm-Up

Part I. History of Haiti

What do you know about the history of Haiti? Have you learned anything about the Haitian Revolution? The role of U.S. occupation and interventions in the country? The multiple devastating earthquakes? The recent assassination of its president?

Read this brief history of Haiti to learn more about the country. It begins:

Haiti has been thwarted by outside interests from its very foundation as a country. For decades, European powers, and later the United States, refused to recognize it as an independent republic. The Caribbean nation became the world’s first Black-led republic when it declared its independence from France on New Year’s Day 1804. That day, Saint-Domingue, once France’s richest colony, known as the “Pearl of the Antilles,” became Haiti. It was a land long coveted for its riches of sugar, coffee and cotton, brought to market by enslaved people. Its declaration of independence meant that, for the first time, a brutally enslaved people had wrenched their freedom from colonial masters. But it came only after decades of bloody war.

You can also watch this six-minute video, produced by AJ+, part of the Al Jazeera Media Network, that focuses on the important role that both France and the United States have played in contributing to Haiti’s struggles.

Archaeologists say that the hill is a dormant volcano and that ceramics recovered there so far suggest that humans have been using the site for several hundred years or more. But some Indonesians, including an earthquake geologist and a president who left office in 2014, have suggested that the site may have been built far earlier by an as-yet-undiscovered ancient civilization.

After the transit of the spy balloon this month, the binational North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, adjusted its radar system to make it more sensitive. As a result, the number of objects it detected increased sharply. In other words, NORAD is picking up more incursions because it is looking for them.

Quotable: “We have been more closely scrutinizing our airspace at these altitudes, including enhancing our radar, which may at least partly explain the increase in objects that we’ve detected over the past week,” Melissa Dalton, the assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense and hemispheric affairs, said at a news conference yesterday.",latest object shaped like octagon shot yesterday f16 lake huron near canadian border,Canada,,IFC.TO,187.9429931640625,189.54542541503906,189.97467041015625,190.38482666015625,0.8526161172594178,0.2264602240741443,1.0810071777031998,1.2992415705342002

The Caribbean nation became the world’s first Black-led republic when it declared its independence from France on New Year’s Day 1804. That day, Saint-Domingue, once France’s richest colony, known as the “Pearl of the Antilles,” became Haiti.

It was a land long coveted for its riches of sugar, coffee and cotton, brought to market by enslaved people. Its declaration of independence meant that, for the first time, a brutally enslaved people had wrenched their freedom from colonial masters. But it came only after decades of bloody war.

earthquake,How to Imagine an Unfamiliar Place,2021-04-20,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/20/magazine/how-to-imagine-an-unfamiliar-place.html,"Calif., Pasadena","“Spend time daydreaming about what a place will look and feel like,” says Aaron Yazzie, 35, a mechanical engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. He designed the drill bits on the Perseverance Rover that will soon begin auguring into Mars to collect rock cores. Yazzie has obviously never been to Mars, but he spends a lot of time imagining it and designing tools that will function on its cold, dusty surface.

To envision a location, it helps to identify known analogues. Yazzie, who is Navajo, grew up playing with his cousins on the rust-colored deserts of the Navajo Nation. When he started working on Mars missions a decade ago, he felt an immediate familiarity with the red planet. “It looks exactly like Northern Arizona,” he says. When stumped with a Mars engineering question, Yazzie starts by picturing himself standing on the mesas of his youth. To test his hardware on Earth, he and his team go out and find rock types akin to what they’ll encounter on Mars.

Don’t focus on what makes a thing foreign. Instead, find points of commonality. To do that, start by finding out as much as you can about the place in question: its geology, history, weather patterns and origin story. Billions of years ago when the solar system formed, scientists believe that Mars and Earth were similar: watery, terrestrial planets with atmospheres. “They have sand dunes just like we have sand dunes, they have Mars quakes just like we have earthquakes,” Yazzie says.

The ability to dream up detailed worlds will serve you in all kinds of contexts, whether you’re preparing to scuba-dive in the deep sea while practicing in a shallow pool; planning a trip to a place you’ve never been; or designing a building on an empty plot of land. The skill can also help you imagine yourself in less familiar roles. Yazzie does outreach about careers in science, engineering and technology to Indigenous youth because he knows that just seeing a person who looks like you, or who grew up in a similar place, can help you chart a path toward a life that might otherwise feel unattainable. “Don’t exclude yourself from giant dreams,” he says.",ability dream detailed worlds serve kinds contexts skill also help imagine less familiar roles envision location helps identify known analogues,Calif.,,PCG,11.144545555114746,11.144545555114746,11.094793319702148,10.736576080322266,0.0,-0.44642677591967006,-0.44642677591967006,-3.6607098313241173

He was 87.

His children, Jason and Michèle Morgan, confirmed the death.

The notion that the earth’s surface moved was not new when Professor Morgan, who taught at Princeton University, first presented his theory at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Washington in April 1967. People had long noticed, for example, that the northeastern edge of South America seemed to match the notch along Africa’s western coast, and wondered if they had once fit together like puzzle pieces.

By the mid-20th century, researchers had made significant steps forward in studying the movement of the earth’s surface, including the discovery that stretches of the sea floor were spreading apart. But the idea, called continental drift, remained highly debated into the 1960s, and no one had come up with a way to synthesize it all into a grand, testable framework.

Professor Morgan had initially planned to discuss underwater trenches at the Geophysical Union meeting. But after reading a paper about fracture zones — vast scars across the ocean floor that offer evidence of past distortions in the earth’s surface — he changed his mind.",w jason morgan 1967 developed theory plate tectonics died july 31 home natick mass 87,Washington,,WY,31.576492309570312,31.4621524810791,31.566965103149414,31.185840606689453,-0.3621042748201529,0.3331387518172679,-0.03017183266429786,-1.2371599069680685

Haiti, once a slave colony notorious for the brutality of its masters, won independence from France after slaves revolted and defeated Napoleon Bonaparte’s forces in 1803. But in the two centuries since, Haiti has struggled to emerge from cycles of dictatorships and coups that have kept the country impoverished and struggling to deliver basic services to many of its people.

For nearly three decades, the country suffered under the dictatorship of François Duvalier, known as Papa Doc, and then his son, Jean-Claude, known as Baby Doc. A priest from a poor area, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, became the first democratically elected president in 1990. But in less than a year, he was deposed in a coup, then returned to power in 1994 with the help of thousands of American troops.

Mr. Aristide was re-elected in 2000, but forced out again after another armed uprising and went into exile. He has called it a “kidnapping” orchestrated by international actors, including the American and French governments.

The administration raised concerns about Puerto Rico's “history of inadequate financial controls over regular government operations” and the “multiple high-profile cases of corruption” that have “marred distribution of aid.” In a statement, the administration also accused the House of “rushing this bill through its process — and seeking to push taxpayer dollars out the door” before the damage had been fully assessed.

Kahn, one of the most important American architects in history, is best known for masterworks like the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif., and the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, as well as the Philips Exeter Academy Library in Exeter, N.H., and the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, N.Y. (He also famously had three families, talked to bricks and died on the men’s room floor in Penn Station.)

It is one unintended consequence of the Fukushima nuclear disaster almost a decade ago, which forced Japan to all but close its nuclear power program. Japan now plans to build as many as 22 new coal-burning power plants — one of the dirtiest sources of electricity — at 17 different sites in the next five years, just at a time when the world needs to slash carbon dioxide emissions to fight global warming.

“Why coal, why now?” said Ms. Kanno, a homemaker in Yokosuka, the site for two of the coal-burning units that will be built just several hundred feet from her home. “It’s the worst possible thing they could build.”

Together the 22 power plants would emit almost as much carbon dioxide annually as all the passenger cars sold each year in the United States.

Several months later, another just like it beached itself in San Diego. Then came the third.

“I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, another one?’” said Ben Frable, a collection manager at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, and now, the custodian of one of the creatures: a rare species of anglerfish, known as the Pacific footballfish.

He added, “It was pretty exciting.”

The fish — which live thousands of feet beneath the ocean in near-total darkness and freezing conditions — are rarely seen by humans. The first was discovered in the early 1900s. Since then, 31 specimens have been collected worldwide, two of them last year in California. (The third was photographed but, before scientists could collect it, washed back out to sea.)

This year is “a good year for footballfish,” Frable told me. “At least for us encountering them, maybe not for them — they are deceased.” The last collected in California was 20 years ago, he added.",pacific fotbalfish rare species anglerfish fish live thousands feet beneath ocean neartotal darkness freezing conditions,California,,PCG,11.801278114318848,11.761475563049316,12.149543762207031,12.945584297180176,-0.3372732248487358,3.2994856561781867,2.9510841496534375,9.696459754413437

She was 64.

The cause was brain cancer, her husband, Gordon Whiting, said.

Ms. Weis, a writer, founded the museum in 1982 with two collaborators. They initially found space for it in a warehouse in San Francisco before moving its 3,000-piece collection to Fisherman’s Wharf. It became a tourist draw before it was forced to close in 1989 because of the Loma Prieta earthquake, one of the most destructive in the city’s history. Ms. Weis was its executive director.

The museum appeared at first to be a collection of capitalist artifacts. A large figure of the Jolly Green Giant flanked Poppin’ Fresh, of Pillsbury fame, and they shared space with the corpulent Bibendum, better known as the Michelin Man.

But Ms. Weis’s intent was to link our conceptions of these pop-culture figures to the human need to mythologize; she asserted that our Fates, Furies and giants were not left behind in Greece or Egypt, but rather transposed to our own culture. The Jolly Green Giant was her selling point when describing the museum to its leadership and the public — he was, she said, a character straight out of “Jack and the Beanstalk.”",elen havre weis executive director museum modern mythology san francisco founded museum 1982 two collaborators,Calif.,,PCG,9.12459659576416,9.084794998168945,9.074844360351562,9.214151382446289,-0.43620117533405944,-0.1095306808726931,-0.5452540820894345,0.9814657091109344

This weekend, the opposition struck back.

Mr. Erdogan’s opponents secured a surprising string of victories in local elections across Turkey on Sunday, increasing the number of the country’s cities under their control and further ensconcing them in most of the major metropolises.

Those opposition victories could serve as a check on Mr. Erdogan’s power at home, analysts said, while enabling rising opposition stars to wield the large budgets of major cities to build their profiles before the next presidential election, expected in 2028.

Turkey’s largest opposition party, the Republican People’s Party, won 37.8 percent of the vote, its highest share since 1977, according to preliminary results from the state-run news agency Anadolu.

The radiation she got from her visit — about two chest X-rays’ worth — was worth the education she received on the tour, she told her 8.6 million Instagram followers. She then spoke admiringly of France, which, she said, “recycles their waste, increasing the efficiency of their system and reducing the overall amount of radioactive waste to deal with.”

Progressive lawmakers, along with environmental groups like the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council, have historically been against nuclear power — often focusing on the danger, longevity and storage requirements of the radioactive waste. During the 2020 presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said, “It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me to add more dangerous waste to this country and to the world when we don’t know how to get rid of what we have right now.” Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts echoed these concerns and pledged not to build any new nuclear plants if elected president.

So it’s no surprise that many Americans believe nuclear waste poses an enormous and terrifying threat. But after talking to engineers, radiation specialists and waste managers, I’ve come to see this misunderstanding is holding us back from embracing a powerful, clean energy source we need to tackle climate change. We must stop seeing nuclear waste as a dangerous problem and instead recognize it as a safe byproduct of carbon-free power.

Why is nuclear so important for reducing carbon emissions? The countries that have cleaned up their electricity production the fastest have generally done so with hydroelectric power, nuclear, or a combination of the two. The distinct advantage of nuclear is that it requires little land and can reliably produce lots of power regardless of weather, time of day or season. Unlike wind and solar, it can substitute directly for fossil fuels without backup or storage.

No recent prime ministers have wanted to commit to spending the tens of millions of dollars it would take to make the stone house habitable again, fearing a political backlash from looking as if they were spending money on themselves.

As hospitals nationwide struggled to deal with surging cases, it became clear that the facility’s new design would need to evolve.

“When the pandemic came along, it really changed the lens of how we do health care design,” said Dr. Nicholas Holmes, chief operating officer of Rady, the only children’s hospital in San Diego County and the largest in California. “And what we learned over the past few years, first and foremost, is to be as flexible in the design process as we can.”

The early waves of the pandemic came crashing into hospitals, revealing intensive care units without enough beds, hallways and waiting rooms that forced the healthy and sick to commingle, and ventilation systems that became conduits for airborne pathogens. Given that hindsight, many hospitals are remodeling with a philosophy of flexible design, the idea that spaces should be adaptable for different purposes at different times. When the next pandemic comes, they’ll be able to better meet the moment.

Traditional hospital design calls for sections that sequester the most vulnerable and contagious patients, with features not found in ordinary inpatient rooms. These include changeable airflow systems to keep microorganisms from traveling beyond the room’s walls; headwalls behind beds for electric, gas and equipment mounts; and, in general, a larger floor plan to accommodate specialized equipment like ventilators.",hospitals remodeling philosophy flexible design next pandemic comes theyl able better meet moment,California,,PCG,13.114742279052734,12.856030464172363,13.154545783996582,12.945584297180176,-1.972679366285325,2.321986717876344,0.30350199871958616,-1.2898307742024246

Taliban leaders provided assurances online and to the news media that they would not carry out reprisal killings or seize property after their takeover in Afghanistan. But there were ominous signs that their promises did not match the situation on the ground. Here are the latest updates and scenes from Kabul — and an overview of the group and its history.

At the Taliban’s first news conference, a spokesman said they would allow women to work and study — but “within the bounds of Islamic law.” Despite this more moderate front, Afghan women expressed deep anxiety as they try to assess their future under Taliban control. Millions are afraid of a return to the repressive past, in which women had few opportunities or freedoms.

Classified reports from American spy agencies leading up to Kabul’s collapse had painted a grim picture of the prospect of a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, even as the Biden administration said publicly that the takeover was unlikely to happen imminently.

Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union’s executive body, described the shipment as a “pilot project” for a maritime aid corridor to Gaza, but offered few details of how it would take place or where in the territory it would be delivered.

The renowned Spanish chef José Andrés, the founder of the World Central Kitchen, posted images on social media on Friday showing pallets being loaded onto a vessel stamped with the names of his group and Open Arms, a Spanish aid group. He said that the plans for the shipment were “in the final stages,” and that it would “land in the beaches of Gaza with 200 pallets.” It remained unclear how the aid, if it reached Gaza, would be collected or distributed.

Since October, organizers and Palestinian cooks working with the World Central Kitchen have served more than 32 million meals in Gaza, the group has said. Its efforts could be bolstered by U.S. military plans to build a floating pier to bring more aid into Gaza, and announcements by Britain, the European Union and other nations on Friday that they would establish a maritime corridor for aid into the territory.

In an interview on Thursday, after the United States announced plans to build the floating pier, Mr. Andrés said it would give the group critical access to a steady supply of food they’d need to more than double the meals they’re serving daily and further aid people in the northern portion of Gaza.

“We’re trying to do the impossible,” he said. “It’s worth trying the impossible to feed the people of Gaza.”

The organization has established 65 community kitchens in Gaza that are managed by local Palestinians, with plans to add at least 35 more, Mr. Andrés said. About 350,000 meals are being served every day, but Mr. Andrés said he would like to distribute more than a million meals.

And then, suddenly, water.

A vast inland sea rose beside the pavement, and the waters glittered far out into the horizon. An egret flapped its snowy white wings along the banks of the newly formed lake. Shorebirds twittered and blue-gray waves lapped and whooshed, bringing the sounds of the beach to the Central Valley.

For the first time in decades, Tulare Lake had returned.

Once the biggest body of fresh water west of the Mississippi, Tulare Lake was four times the size of Lake Tahoe, home to bands of Yokut Indians and millions of birds and other wildlife, but it was sucked dry by farmers before fully disappearing by the mid-20th century. The lakebed is now home to some of the planet’s major suppliers of cotton, tomatoes and other crops.

But occasionally, during an especially wet winter, the lake comes back to life.

After the barrage of atmospheric rivers that have swept through California over the past three months, Tulare Lake has not only reappeared, but it has also grown to cover 30 square miles — and could expand to 200 square miles in the coming months.",biggest body fresh water west mississippi tulare lake sucked dry farmers lakebed home planets major suppliers cotton tomatoes crops,California,,PCG,16.08993911743164,16.109838485717773,16.050134658813477,16.73672103881836,0.12367584576236267,-0.3706047516070846,-0.24738725440570752,4.0197909803524565

Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader, was found guilty of embezzlement yesterday and disqualified from running for public office for five years.

The decision infuriated Le Pen, an anti-immigrant, nationalist politician who has already mounted three failed presidential bids. She claimed that the ruling was a “political” attempt to thwart her and vowed to fight back despite slim chances of legal success. “I’m not going to submit to a democratic denial so easily,” she said angrily.

But he took other actions this week that could more quickly affect the way the country prepares for and adapts to climate changes driven by the burning of fossil fuels.

Safeguarding the nation.

In 2021, President Biden ordered the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security to study the security implications of climate change and to incorporate them into defense strategy and other national security plans.

In response, the Pentagon, Homeland Security and the intelligence community detailed how food shortages could lead to social unrest, how countries may fight over dwindling water supplies and how people would flee climate shocks in places like Latin America, increasing migration to the United States.

President Trump rescinded that order on Monday. That doesn’t prevent the Defense Department from considering climate change in its planning.

flood,We Have to Stop Underwriting People Who Move to Climate Danger Zones,2025-01-16,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/opinion/la-fires-climate-home-insurance.html,"Florida, Malibu, Virginia, California, Okla., Arizona, Texas, Louisiana","In theory, insurance prices quantify the risks of living in a certain place. Of course it should be more expensive to insure a home in an area buffeted by disaster. But in practice, states vary widely in their willingness to allow insurance premiums to increase, with some making it far harder than others for insurers to raise prices. California is one of the most resistant, and until recently refused to let insurers raise premiums or reflect climate-catastrophe risks in their pricing.

Insurers doing business in such heavily regulated states, finding themselves unable to raise premiums when needed, wind up shifting some of the costs to homeowners who happen to live in states that are more accommodating to premium increases. That is, in part, how middle-class communities, such as Enid, Okla., can end up subsidizing the owners of million-dollar houses in Malibu. And under our current regulatory regime, that dynamic is only expected to strengthen as climate losses continue to cut into insurance companies’ bottom line.

The voices loudly criticizing California for its rigid control of insurance pricing are ignoring numerous similar examples from the rest of the country. In 2023, after the federal flood insurance program began to adjust its premiums to better reflect climate realities, 10 states across the political spectrum — including reliably red Louisiana, Florida and Texas and moderate blue Virginia — sued the program. And California isn’t the only state that failed to raise premiums to properly fund its FAIR plan, the state-sponsored insurer of last resort often relied on by those living in climate-vulnerable areas; Florida did as well.

Home insurance is just one way our financial system encourages Americans to move to flood-prone sections of Florida or parched, air-conditioning-dependent Arizona. The government mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which guarantee about 70 percent of mortgages on single-family homes, charge the same fees regardless of climate risk. Nobody intends to move into harm’s way. Many people settle in places like Texas because housing is generally more affordable. But that affordability is a mirage: Their mortgage and insurance risks are being subsidized by everyone else.

As Los Angeles burned for days on end, horrifying the nation, scientists made an announcement on Friday that could help explain the deadly conflagration: 2024 was the hottest year in recorded history.

With temperatures rising around the globe and the oceans unusually warm, scientists are warning that the world has entered a dangerous new era of chaotic floods, storms and fires made worse by human-caused climate change.

The firestorms ravaging the country’s second-largest city are just the latest spasm of extreme weather that is growing more furious as well as more unpredictable. Wildfires are highly unusual in Southern California in January, which is supposed to be the rainy season. The same is true for cyclones in Appalachia, where Hurricanes Helene and Milton shocked the country when they tore through mountain communities in October.

Wildfires are burning hotter and moving faster. Storms are getting bigger and carrying more moisture.

More than 200 people are dead; nearly 90 are still missing; hundreds of houses, roads and railways are destroyed; and towns are cut off without electricity, water, or provisions. Hundreds of families have lost everything. Large swaths of the region have been transformed into a brown hell, reeking of decay, after rivers topped their banks, sending water coursing through towns and cities.

But there is more than one kind of mud.

When administrative incompetence mixes with political partisanship, as has happened here, then another kind of mud emerges: populism. In this catastrophe, those anti-government forces that have been swirling in the dark edges of Spanish politics for years are now feeding on the many levels of incompetence of the state, and the absence of an effective public response by regional or national authorities.

Right now both València and Spain, mired in this morass, are at risk of being engulfed by the zeitgeist undermining so many Western democracies — and summarized in the slogan that quickly emerged on Spanish social media after the floods: “Only the people save the people.” It is the old trick of populism: confronting established institutions with the philosophical falsehood of the peoples’s purity; the idea that the average citizen is more capable at solving the problems of society than the government is.

I was born here. I grew up here. I belong to a people — the Valèncian people — with an almost pathological obsession with water due to our history of severe droughts and torrential autumn rains. Water turned us into one of the main agricultural regions of the Mediterranean and enriched us with the export of our oranges, one of the largest sources of foreign currency in Spain during the years of Francisco Franco’s dictatorship. We had little industry but we had water, and that allowed us to survive.

In basic terms, eastern Spain was flooded this week because of a cutoff low: an area of low pressure that breaks away from the jet stream, the fast-moving current of wind that meanders west to east across the globe’s temperate regions.

When a cutoff low forms in the Gulf of Cádiz off southern Spain, it produces winds that blow warm, moist air from above the Mediterranean Sea toward the country’s eastern coast. This moisture-laden air hits the mountains and is pushed skyward, condensing into clouds that dump rain onto coastal areas including the province of Valencia.

Normally the jet stream would whisk such weather systems away relatively quickly.

In very disparate regions of the world, extreme rainfall in recent weeks has killed thousands of people, submerged entire towns, set off landslides and left millions without power. It’s a harbinger of the wild weather events that are a hallmark of climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, and it is highlighting the need to urgently adapt, in rich and poor countries alike.

Bursts of extreme rainfall are making both coastal and riverine flooding more dangerous and unpredictable.

Hurricane season had been quiet and the number of wildfires was still below the yearly average. Insurers were beginning to hope that the cost of reinsurance — that is, insurance for insurers — would only inch up next year, instead of shooting higher as it did the previous two years.

Two major hurricanes have upended their calculations.

Total economic losses from Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene could soar over $200 billion, according to early estimates. While it’s far too soon to know exactly what portion will be covered by insurance companies, some consumer groups, lawmakers and analysts are already worried about a big hit to insurers’ finances that could ultimately affect millions of people living in the most vulnerable areas.

As climate change increases the intensity of natural disasters, insurance companies have pulled back from many high-risk areas by raising premiums or ending some types of coverage. The fallout from the two hurricanes, which landed within the span of two weeks, could accelerate that retreat. It could also further strain an already feeble federal flood insurance program that has filled in gaps for homeowners living in areas where private insurance companies no longer offer flood coverage.

Hurricane Milton, which hit Florida’s west coast as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday, did not ultimately cause the catastrophe that had been predicted for the Tampa Bay area.

Its path of destruction was uneven, though, and in many areas, officials were working to make repairs.

Some places near the Gulf of Mexico, as well as farther inland, were inundated, though not to the degree that officials had feared. Many homes in the storm’s path were leveled — by one early estimate, more than 120 were destroyed — while other structures nearby remained intact. At least 14 deaths have been linked to the storm.

“We did not get the worst-case scenario,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said after the storm passed. “But we did get hit, and we’re going to have to work to bounce back.”

Here is what we know about the storm and its impact.

How bad was the damage from the hurricane?

The damage varied from one county to the next. The Tampa Bay region did not experience the disastrous storm surge that many forecasters had feared.

Her desperation was all too familiar — three people, including a toddler, had drowned in the basement of the house where she lives, when the remnants of Hurricane Ida hit New York City two years ago.

“I’m experiencing PTSD right now,” she said.

As floodwaters inundated the city, they also poured into apartments located in basements and cellars, underscoring how such homes — where an estimated 100,000 New Yorkers live — can turn into death traps.

We are now in such a period, with two unfolding climate-fueled disasters occurring at once: Savage wildfires in the West that have consumed more than five million acres of forests and scrublands and taken multiple lives in four states, and a Category 2 hurricane that has brought dangerous flooding and widespread damage to the Florida Panhandle.

Once again, disaster has yielded glimmers of hope, or at least evidence of common sense. A recent Times article by Christopher Flavelle, a Washington-based climate reporter, notes that Americans by substantial margins support much stronger building codes and even outright bans on new construction in flood- and fire-prone zones. Eighty-four percent of people surveyed supported mandatory building codes in risky areas, and well over half supported outright bans. One interesting aspect of these findings — drawn from a joint survey by Stanford University, the environmental research group Resources for the Future and the survey company ReconMR — is that a majority of Republicans favored tougher rules. That’s surprising because Republicans tend to be much more skeptical about global warming than Democrats and, more to the point, much more hostile to government regulation.

The survey, however, also highlights a depressing underside: While the public’s appreciation of the dangers of building in risky areas may be shifting, attitudes in state and local governments and the real estate industry have hardly budged. These are the entities that hold the cards when it comes to residential construction. For all sorts of reasons, not least the need for property tax revenues for schools and other purposes, local communities want to build, even when the environmental risks seem self-evident. According to the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, an advocacy group that works to strengthen homes from natural and man-made disasters, just one-third of local jurisdictions in the United States have adopted disaster-resistant building codes. Not surprisingly, the idea of flatly banning new homes outright in at-risk areas is anathema, even among climate-sensitive politicians. In an interview with The Associated Press last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who has adopted several useful fire-prevention measures, seemed nearly offended when asked whether he would ban home building in at-risk areas.

“There is something that is truly Californian about the wilderness and the wild and the pioneering spirit,” Mr. Newsom said. “I am not advocating for no.”",americans support stronger building codes outright bans new construction flood fireprone zones survey shows attitudes state local governments real estate industry hardly budged,Washington,,WY,23.121780395507812,22.38802146911621,23.113447189331055,22.38802146911621,-3.173453401253474,3.2402404170263672,-0.03604050395001943,-3.173453401253474

At the same time, there is a growing psychological toll on homeowners who have already relinquished the lower floors of their homes to water and mold, as they continue to pour money into repairs or improvements while waiting for disaster relief or buyout offers.

“I get panic attacks every time it rains,” said Amrita Bhagwandin, who has lived through six floods in Hollis, Queens, spending more than $160,000 on repairs to her house.

But the drive for homeownership remains strong, some real estate experts said. “The demand is insatiable,” said Joseph Tirone Jr., a broker with the real estate firm Compass, who was instrumental in organizing buyouts of damaged homes on Staten Island after Hurricane Sandy walloped much of the borough in 2012. “There’s really not much else people can buy,” he said. “So they buy in flood zones.”

Across the five boroughs, over $3.6 billion worth of one- to three-family homes sold last year were likely to flood before the end of a 30-year mortgage, according to a new report from Rebuild by Design, a climate resiliency nonprofit. That represents roughly one out of every five such homes sold in New York City in 2023.

Electric vehicles contain lithium-ion batteries, which can also be found in e-bikes and scooters, wheelchairs, golf carts, electric lawn mowers and tools like cordless drills. If these batteries are soaked in saltwater, some can ignite after floodwaters subside.

But discerning the relationship between any given flood and climate change is no small feat, experts say, made difficult by limited historical records, particularly for the most extreme floods, which occur infrequently.

It can be tempting to attribute all floods and other extreme events to the forces of warming planet. But weather is not climate, even though weather can be affected by climate. For example, scientists are confident that climate change makes unusually hot days more common. They’re not as sure that climate change is making tornadoes more severe.

Floods fall somewhere along the confidence spectrum between heat waves (“yes, clearly”) and tornadoes (“we don’t know yet”), said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at University of California, Los Angeles. “I’d say, ‘yes, probably, but…’”",floods surge year round every region world discerning relationship given flood climate change small feat scientists confident climate change makes unusually hot days common,Los Angeles,,TRV,151.35426330566406,152.1868438720703,150.38926696777344,149.5945281982422,0.5500872907192781,-1.1811644545358566,-0.6375745993634739,-1.162659755323867

In 2024 Republican primary polling, he consistently comes in second to Donald Trump. He has built his legend on an easy re-election as Florida’s governor and an easy route by which he enacted a slate of bullying and regressive “anti-woke” legislation, thanks to Republicans’ supermajorities in Florida’s Legislature.

He brandishes his record as evidence of his effectiveness, but all he’s done is win a series of fights in which his opponents had their hands tied by being in the minority.

Yet many Republican commentators and donors, who’ve been desperate to move on from the toxicity of Trump, landed on DeSantis when casting about for alternatives. They inflated his ego, convincing him his big-footing in Florida made him formidable.

He appears to be banking on Trump fatigue, or maybe Trump’s legal problems piling so high that even the former president’s most ardent supporters come to the conclusion that he is too encumbered to prevail.

flood,Tampa Residents Warned to Expect ‘Worst Hurricane in Their Lifetime’,2024-10-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/weather/tampa-hurricane-history.html,"Florida, Tampa","In October 1921, when the population was only about 120,000, the Tampa Bay area was hit by a Category 3 storm that shredded fishing piers and smashed steamships into docks. The storm submerged railroad cars and leveled trees and utility poles. Eight people died in the storm, nearly half drowned by the storm surge that inundated the shoreline.

Mr. Davis said Tampa Bay was also hit by three major storms in the 1800s, including a hurricane known as the Great Gale of 1848. That one destroyed nearly all the buildings in the area, which was then little more than a settlement of several hundred people near a military outpost, Fort Brooke.

Timing is critical, Mr. Davis said.

“This is the time of year where the tracks have a higher chance of hitting the Tampa Bay region from the Gulf of Mexico,” he said. “The previous storms that hit Tampa did just this. They formed in the Western Gulf and they went almost straight east into parts of the Florida peninsula, right around Tampa Bay.”

The 1921 storm struck in late October; the storm in 1848, in late September.

Hurricane Milton, which rapidly intensified in the Gulf of Mexico on Monday, becoming a Category 5 storm, is expected to make landfall somewhere near Tampa as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday, according to the Weather Service.

Like in 1921, the storm surge is expected to be 10 to 15 feet.

The flood, fueled by torrential rains that fell atop melting snow tore out much of the river’s template — the physical features of the river — and built a new one. Its swell was measured over 51,000 cubic feet per second just north of the park, far surpassing the high of more than 32,000 in 1990s flooding. It’s the type of event that occurs here once every 500 years; floods of this magnitude are known as reset floods.

Experts say the flood, as well as recent record flooding in Australia and southern China, is likely driven by a warmer atmosphere, which can hold more moisture; and that more floods like this are forecast as the world heats further.

In the midst of the damage and dislocation caused by overflowing rivers, experts point out that floods play a vital ecological role over time.

Torrential rain continued to lash many states on Monday afternoon, including the capital region of Delhi, where roads in several areas were submerged in knee-deep water and court hearings had to be suspended or shifted online, away from flooded courthouses.

Some scientists have developed new metrics to try to capture a hurricane’s rain risk. But Mr. Schreck, who recently developed one such measure, said the National Hurricane Center understandably does not want to confuse the public with multiple rating scales.

Experts still hope to grow public awareness beyond the category rating. “We need to rethink how we name, categorize and talk about these things because too many people are dying,” said Kathie Dello, the state climatologist of North Carolina.

When it comes to big storms, “I never think about the category,” she said.

Hurricane Florence — one of the wettest and most destructive hurricanes to hit North Carolina — made landfall as a Category 1. And Fred, a storm that caused record-breaking flooding in western North Carolina in 2021, was a tropical storm, not a hurricane.

Even “downgraded” to a tropical storm, Helene was still deadly: Its unusually large size meant that it took longer for the storm to pass overhead, and so it rained longer.

High-tide floods are not caused by the weather but by the twice monthly alignment of the Earth, sun and moon. When there is a full or a new moon, the sun and moon exert a gravitational pull that causes tides to swell.

But as climate change causes sea levels to rise, high tide floods — sometimes called nuisance floods or sunny-day floods because they can happen on clear days — are likely to inundate more coastal neighborhoods across the five boroughs.

Their advice starts with a warning: Do not try to cross a flooded road. Most vehicles, from tiny sedans to large trucks, can be swept away in just one to two feet of water. But during flash flooding, many drivers do not realize the danger.

It is difficult to determine a precise number of accidental drownings in cars because vehicle fatalities are classified differently from region to region, said Gordon Giesbrecht, a professor at the University of Manitoba who has studied drownings and human responses to extreme environments. But he estimated that about 350 to 400 people a year drown in their cars in the United States and Canada after their vehicle falls into a body of water or becomes stranded in flooding.

He urged people to get out of their vehicle as soon as possible, saying there may be very little time before the water becomes inescapable. A vehicle that is carried away could also roll over, making escape virtually impossible. “Bottom line is if the car stalls out in water, get out and on the roof,” Dr. Giesbrecht said.",try cross flooded road vehicles swept away one two feet water many drivers realize danger flash flooding,the United States,,TRV,142.86935424804688,144.1631622314453,141.4917449951172,146.35984802246094,0.9055881789401485,-1.853051219866643,-0.964244053723313,2.4431368034000753

Many of the same areas that suffered through the Black Summer bush fires in 2019 and 2020, the worst in the country’s recorded history, are now dealing with prodigious rainfall during the wettest, coldest November since at least 1900.

Hundreds of people across several states have been forced to evacuate. Many more are stranded on floodplain islands with no way to leave except by boat or helicopter, possibly until after Christmas.

And with a second year of the weather phenomenon known as La Niña in full swing, meteorologists are predicting even more flooding for Australia’s east coast, adding to the stress from the pandemic and a recent rural mouse plague of biblical proportions.

Quotable: “It feels constant,” said Brett Dickinson, a 58-year-old wheat farmer who lives in northwest New South Wales, about a six-hour drive from Sydney. “We’re constantly battling all the elements — and the animals, too.”",many areas suffered black summer bush fires dealing prodigious rainfall many stranded floodplain islands way leave except boat,Australia,,QBE.AX,10.524725914001465,10.181527137756348,10.181527137756348,9.996728897094727,-3.260880891810647,0.0,-3.260880891810647,-5.01672937823799

Extreme weather events are becoming increasingly common, in Europe and worldwide. The deadly torrential rain in Europe this summer was considered a 400-year event; in China, over 20 inches of rain fell in just two days; New York City set records for an hour’s rainfall, setting off flash floods that killed dozens of people in the region; the drought-stricken American West is ablaze.

Yet no one died in the Netherlands in the July flooding. Some tributaries did wreak extensive damage in the border region, but along the Maas River, which swelled to epic proportions, large urban centers stayed safe and dry.

The Dutch are experienced in water management, having dealt with sea-level rise and river floods long before climate change became a concern. More than half the country lies beneath sea level, and while the ocean is held back by more conventional flood control methods, river management has changed drastically.

Mr. Van der Broeck’s project, Maaspark Ooijen-Wanssum, a nature preserve near the small city of Wanssum, lies at the heart of the new approach. During the flooding it did exactly what it was supposed to, absorbing so much water that levels in parts of the Maas River dropped by 13 inches, enough to avert a major disaster.

“If we hadn’t freed up the areas to reroute the excess water from the Maas River, Venlo and Roermond would have been flooded,” Mr. van der Broeck said of two regional cities. “For a long time we have worked against nature,” he said. “The river is telling us it needs more space.

The storm — which intensified from predawn showers to heavy rain, high winds and, in some places, flash flood warnings — sent Californians from the Northern California coast to Santa Barbara scrambling for shelter, and left hundreds of thousands without power. A succession of similar weather systems is expected to pound the state for the next several days.

The National Flood Insurance Program

About 75 percent of all flood insurance policies are administered by FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program. You can buy one of these policies through a local insurance broker or get referred to one by calling the national program at (888) 379-9531.

Any renter, homeowner or business owner in one of the 23,000 participating communities is eligible for a policy, with rates set by FEMA. But those rates are changing. Currently, the average annual premium is $734, according to ValuePenguin. But a new rating system, called Risk Rating 2.0, which FEMA rolled out this month, takes into account a home’s location, its size and its overall flood risk. While 23 percent of policy holders will see their rates drop under the changes, 66 percent could see their rates rise by as much as $120 a year, and 4 percent could see their rates rise by $240 a year. Existing policyholders will see rates rise beginning in April. Lawmakers from coastal states, including New York and New Jersey, have urged Congress to block the new rates.

The national program’s coverage is reliable, but it’s limited. Residential policies max out at $250,000 for the building and $100,000 for contents. And not all contents are covered. If your basement floods, your policy could replace your walls, boiler and hot-water heater, but not the cost of replacing any personal possessions in the basement, like sofas, televisions and clothes.

If you have a finished basement or live in an expensive area like New York, a national flood policy would probably not make you whole in a major disaster. “If you have a $500,000 home, you may have a huge gap” in coverage, Mr. Friedlander said.",75 percent flood insurance policies administered femas national flood insurance program buy one policies local insurance broker get referred one calling national program 88 379,New York,,TRV,146.35987854003906,146.44363403320312,145.4197235107422,145.65240478515625,0.057225719233669536,-0.6991840438955418,-0.6423584377597585,-0.483379572284403

The increase in high-tide flooding along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts since 2000 has been “extraordinary,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported, with the frequency of flooding in some cities growing fivefold during that time. That shift is damaging homes, imperiling the safety of drinking water, inundating roads and otherwise hurting coastal communities, the agency said.

“Conditions are changing, and not just in a few locations,” Nicole LeBoeuf, acting assistant administrator for NOAA’s National Ocean Service, which compiled the report, said during a call with reporters. “Damaging floods that decades ago happened only during a storm now happen more regularly, even without severe weather.”

NOAA defines high-tide flooding, also called sunny-day or nuisance flooding, as water rising more than half a meter, or about 20 inches, above the normal daily high-tide mark. The frequency of that flooding has increased because of rising sea levels, which were roughly 13 inches higher nationally last year than in 1920, the agency reported.",increase hightide flooding along atlantic gulf coasts since 200 extraordinary noaa says frequency flooding cities grown fivefold time,the United States,,TRV,103.14730834960938,107.03882598876953,107.571533203125,110.3705062866211,3.772776722365043,0.4976766228838872,4.289229573029745,7.002798281976761

For years, even as seas rose and flooding worsened nationwide, policymakers stuck to the belief that relocating entire communities away from vulnerable areas was simply too extreme to consider — an attack on Americans’ love of home and private property as well as a costly use of taxpayer dollars. Now, however, that is rapidly changing amid acceptance that rebuilding over and over after successive floods makes little sense.

The shift threatens to uproot people not only on the coasts but in flood-prone areas nationwide, while making the consequences of climate change even more painful for cities and towns already squeezed financially.

This month, the Federal Emergency Management Agency detailed a new program, worth an initial $500 million, with billions more to come, designed to pay for large-scale relocation nationwide. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has started a similar $16 billion program.

As kernels of wheat blackened in the rain, becoming unfit for human consumption, the government mobilized emergency teams to salvage as much of the harvest as possible. In a viral video, a 79-year-old farmer in Henan Province wiped away tears as he surveyed the damage.

The unusually heavy rainfall, which local officials said was the worst disruption to the wheat harvest in a decade, underscored the risks that climate shocks pose to President Xi Jinping’s push for China to become more self-reliant in its food supply.

Ensuring China’s ability to feed 1.4 billion people is a key piece of Mr. Xi’s goal of leading the country to superpower status. In recent years, tensions with the United States, the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s war on Ukraine have all created more volatility in global food prices, heightening the urgency for China to grow more of its own crops.

The country has not experienced food price inflation at the levels seen in other major economies, but officials are concerned about the vulnerability of its food supply to global shocks. Last summer, prices for pork, fruit and vegetables spiked in China, prompting the government to release pork from its strategic reserves to stabilize prices.

Flash floods can develop quickly, within hours or even minutes; and they often catch people off guard, killing an average of 88 people in the United States each year.

“Flash floods occur when there’s just too much water coming in too fast,” said Bonnie Schneider, a meteorologist and author of “Extreme Weather.” And climate change is compounding the risks: Warmer air holds more moisture, Ms. Schneider said, which can lead to heavier, more intense rainfall.

Though flash floods are scary, experts say you can increase your odds of survival by staying informed and having a plan. Here’s what to do in advance — and in the moment — to get through a flash flood safely.

Understand the difference between the various alerts.

Or else.

Misabo, a gloomy boar with a mountain on his head who wears whale overalls hiked up to his snout, has the daunting job of promoting the village as a tourism destination. He waddled into the world in 2013, as a mascot craze swept Japan and hundreds of the country’s graying and shrinking towns turned to colorful, often wacky characters to lure visitors and investment.

As the forecast for Hurricane Henri has evolved over the past few days, attention has focused on where the storm will make landfall and the risks from wind and storm surge on the coast. But the latest forecasts point to a substantial and perhaps underappreciated risk from inland flooding.

For New York State in particular, the threat is shaping up to resemble not so much Hurricane Sandy in 2012, but Hurricane Irene the previous year. That storm devastated the mountainous eastern parts of the state, as well as much of New England. Its slow motion allowed rainfall totals to escalate, filling small tributaries and then larger rivers past their banks.

Henri, too, is expected to move slowly after landfall, but its predicted path has shifted west with time.

Over the next 30 years, 7.5 million more are projected to leave those perennially flooded zones, according to the study.

All of this suggests a possible boom for inland and Northern cities. But it also will leave behind large swaths of coastal and other vulnerable land where older adults and the poor are very likely to disproportionately remain.

The Southern United States stands to be especially transformed. Extreme heat, storms and coastal flooding will weigh heavily on the bottom third of this country, making the environment less comfortable and life within it more expensive and less prosperous.

The young, mobile and middle class will be more likely to leave to chase opportunity and physical and economic safety. That means government — from local to federal — must now recognize its responsibility to support the communities in climate migration’s wake. Even as an aging population left behind will require greater services, medical attention and physical accommodation, the residents that remain will reside in states that may also face diminished representation in Congress, because their communities are shrinking. Local governments could be left to fend alone, but with an evaporating tax base to work with.

In December, the First Street Foundation created one of the first clear pictures of how this demographic change is unfolding. It looked at flood risk and migration patterns down to the census tract, across the country, and identified hundreds of thousands of so-called abandonment zones where the out-migration of residents in response to rising risk had already passed a tipping point, and people were making small, local moves to higher ground.",young mobile middle class likely leave chase opportunity physical economic safety southern united states stands especially transformed,Texas,,CNP,29.499561309814453,29.657472610473633,29.904207229614258,29.104787826538086,0.5353005049829093,0.8319475579773101,1.3717014824392648,-1.338235098245433

flood,A Flood of New Workers Has Made the Fed’s Job Less Painful. Can It Persist?,2023-07-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/business/economy/labor-supply-federal-reserve.html,"New York, the United States","The development is owed partly to a rebound in immigration as the United States has eased pandemic-related restrictions, cleared processing backlogs and enacted more permissive policies. Labor supply has also received a boost as some demographic groups — including women in their prime working years — have returned to the job market in bigger numbers than anticipated, pushing their employment rates to record highs.

That influx has made the Fed’s job a little less painful. Hiring has been able to chug along at a solid clip without further overheating the labor market because job seekers are becoming available to replace those who are getting snapped up. Unemployment has held steady around 3.5 percent, and some data even suggests that staffing is becoming less strained. Wage growth has begun to slow, for instance, and workers are no longer pulling such long hours.

“Monetary policy is part of the story to get demand moving towards supply, but any help we can get from supply increasing, that’s good news,” John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview with The Financial Times this month.

Employers have added about 280,000 workers per month so far in 2023. Job gains have been gradually slowing, but that is nearly triple the 100,000 pace that Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, suggested he expected would be necessary to provide jobs for a steadily growing population.

The expanding supply of workers has allowed the Fed to accept the faster-than-expected hiring without slamming the brakes on the economy even more aggressively. Fed officials, who have raised interest rates above 5 percent from near zero in March 2022, have nudged them up more and more slowly over recent months. Policymakers are expected to raise rates by a quarter-point at their meeting this week, to a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent.

This latest catastrophic flooding comes less than a month after extreme rainfall submerged towns, causing widespread misery in the region.

On Monday, officials in Assam, a state in northeastern India bordering Bangladesh, said all the state’s 33 districts were affected by the floods, which they blamed for undoing almost a decade of progress on building roads, bridges and other infrastructure connecting far-flung towns and villages dotted across the state’s lush green mountains.

Then Came the Floods.,2022-09-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/07/opinion/environment/pakistan-climate-change-floods.html,Pakistan,"Sometimes a weather event is so extreme and so far-reaching, it can be hard to make sense of, particularly from a distance. A third of Pakistan has been submerged by flooding now for at least a week, leading to image after image and video after video of endless water where homes and roads were meant to be. More than a thousand people have died, with more than a million houses destroyed or damaged. More than 100 bridges have collapsed, and thousands of miles of roads have been damaged. Hundreds of thousands of farm animals have died, and as many as 73,000 women are expected to give birth over the next month without adequate medical support.

Almost certainly, the monsoon rains were made worse by climate change, in part because rapidly melting glaciers contributed, and soon after the most striking images began to circulate internationally, there were calls for climate reparations, with which the world’s rich would compensate the world’s poor for the ravages of warming. (Among those making that call was Pakistan’s outspoken climate minister, Sherry Rehman.) Others argued that flooding of this scale, in a country only very fractionally responsible for global warming, made clear the need for a loss-and-damage system — which is what climate advocates say is a more circumscribed approach to help channel support from the rich countries of the world to those suffering most from climate impacts.

But as with any disaster, climate alone does not tell the whole story, and as the flooding wore on, blame has been spread around more widely. In the Pakistani English-language newspaper Dawn, the columnist Arifa Noor outlined many of the country’s policy and preparation failures in the decade since devastating 2010 floods that killed almost 2,000 Pakistanis, caused billions of dollars in damage and at the time were “the worst natural disaster to date attributable to climate change,” according to ClimateWire. Now “Pakistan has been hit by another calamity, but this time around nature has been even more wrathful,” Noor wrote. “The problem is that climate change is also turning into an excuse,” she went on, adding that “the rains and their intensity are beyond our control; the havoc they wreak is not.”

As the flooding continued, Foreign Policy declared that “bad governance exacerbated Pakistan’s flooding,” listing some long-term mistakes: failing water infrastructure, deforestation, poor drainage systems and dangerous, unregulated construction. But there are immediate needs, as well, of course. “Pakistan is at its nadir of political stability,” the climate scientist Fahad Saeed of Climate Analytics wrote last week, citing the ouster, by a messy 13-party coalition, of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf national government, and the fact that the P.T.I. remains in power at the provincial level. “In a recently called all-parties conference, P.T.I. was not even invited,” he wrote, “a reflection of the political bitterness, even during the time of worst flooding of country’s history.”",third pakistan submerged flooding least week thousand people died million houses destroyed damaged,Pakistan,,PAK,15.175125122070312,15.072148323059082,15.053424835205078,14.407476425170898,-0.6785894559871777,-0.12422574043647508,-0.8019722136474289,-5.058598797205075

Irene killed at least 40 people in 11 states and caused more than $6.5 billion in damage.

Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont said he feared that the sheer volume of water dumped on his state by this week’s storm system could surpass the amount that fell during Irene, because the region will be pummeled by rain for several days.

“What’s different for me is that Irene lasted about 24 hours,” he said at a news conference on Monday morning. “We’re getting just as much rain, if not more, and it’s going on for days. That’s my concern. It’s not just the initial damage.”

If local governments continue to allow homes to go up in places most exposed to climate change, such as coastlines, floodplains or fire-prone wilderness, experts say, it will make generations of current and future residents more vulnerable to worsening hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters.

Yet those long-term concerns have typically been outweighed by the demand for new homes, and the jobs and tax revenue that come with them. In many coastal states, the most flood-prone areas have seen the highest rates of home construction since 2010, a study last year found. And in California and elsewhere, officials continue to approve development in areas hit by fires.

“Some of the most vulnerable land also ends up being some of the highest-priced land,” said Otis Rolley, senior vice president at the Rockefeller Foundation and former North America managing director for 100 Resilient Cities, an initiative that worked with cities to better withstand shocks from climate change and other challenges. “There’s a lot of pressure on elected officials.”

A wave of disasters has pushed some cities and counties to limit where they build. The new survey — a joint project of Stanford; Resources for the Future, a Washington research group; and ReconMR, a survey research company — asked whether governments should require that new buildings in risky areas “need to be made in a way that doesn’t get damaged easily by floods.”

Most hospitals have moved key infrastructure to higher floors.

But Ms. Mayhew said there was only so much to be done in the face of a storm as powerful as Milton. “In the last few years, hospitals in Florida have had to frequently deal with these types of emergencies, but there is undoubtedly a heightened sense of concern given the magnitude of this storm and where it is likely they hit,” she said.

He also said that states should respond first to disasters, which is already how the system works. FEMA steps in only if a state can’t handle a disaster on its own, or at the request of a governor.

It could rain for days in Southern California starting on Saturday afternoon, potentially in record amounts, creating the risk of what the National Weather Service described as “life-threatening flooding” Sunday into Monday.

The storm system is also expected to bring several feet of snow to the Sierra Nevada, and powerful onshore winds and intense, damaging surf along the California coast.

Here is what to know.

The effects of this system will begin to be felt in California on Saturday afternoon, and will last through Tuesday.

The heaviest rainfall is likely south of the Bay Area, and excessive rainfall is most likely from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles.

There could be dangerous flash flooding in places. The Weather Service warned that, starting on Sunday, the Los Angeles River “will fill quickly and become a raging river and a very dangerous place to be.”

There is an extremely high chance — over 90 percent — of at least two feet of snow, especially above 6,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada, causing difficult to impossible driving conditions Sunday and Monday.

This atmospheric river will be stronger than the last two.

This storm will connect to an atmospheric river, a stream of moisture in the sky that is typically a couple of hundred miles wide and can be seen on satellite imagery.

It will carry an abundant amount of moisture from the tropics near Hawaii and as it makes landfall, the mountains will wring the moisture out of the air like a sopping wet towel, causing precipitation to fall in record amounts.",storm system also expected bring several feet snow sierra nevada powerful onshore winds intense damaging surf along california coast heaviest rainfall likely south bay area excessive rainfall,Hawaii,,HE,13.329999923706055,13.390000343322754,12.970000267028809,13.25,0.45011567862048185,-3.1366696454446954,-2.7006726086848896,-0.6001494685966421

Rivers, streams and creeks inland will be overrun, but unable to drain out to sea because of the storm surge that has inundated coastal areas, they said.

“This has been such a large area of heavy rainfall,” said Ross Giarratana, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Tampa Bay Area office. “That hits a lot of river basins and causes a lot of extra runoff that ends up needing to pass through the river system, but it can’t because they’re overflowing.”

Hundreds of houses swelled with muddy floodwaters more than a foot deep. Cars were wrecked. Many residents couldn’t work because the fields where they were employed as farmworkers were drenched. Dozens of families lost most of their possessions and had to move into temporary shelters.

And when financial relief was made available, it fell short.

And nearly 60 percent of the Planada households in which at least one member lost work were unable to apply for unemployment benefits, the survey found.

flood,U.S. Ruling Could Mean a Flood of New Claims Against Volkswagen,2020-06-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/climate/volkswagen.html,"Florida, the United States, Hillsborough County, California, Salt Lake County, Utah","Volkswagen, the German automaker that admitted to a decade-long scheme to cheat on diesel emissions tests in the United States and elsewhere, could face a “staggering” volume of claims from local governments after a federal appeals court ruled on Monday that counties in Florida and in Utah could impose local pollution laws on the manufacturer.

Volkswagen has already paid more than $20 billion in federal criminal and civil penalties as well as other legal settlements after the Environmental Protection Agency accused it in 2015 of using illegal software to conceal poisonous emissions. Those include settlements in lawsuits brought by consumers related to its sale of about 600,000 diesel cars equipped with devices that illegally circumvented emissions tests.

But those settlements did not release Volkswagen from claims brought by local governments, some of whom have brought their own suits against the automaker, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said in a unanimous ruling.

Volkswagen argued that the Clean Air Act pre-empted those counties’ claims and that the company — as well as Audi and Porsche, subsidiaries that are also accused of cheating — should be regulated solely by the E.P.A. on the matter. In a 2018 ruling, a federal court in California had sided with the automakers, tossing out claims brought by Salt Lake County in Utah and Hillsborough County in Florida.",federal appeals court ruled monday local governments sue volkswagen company already paid 20 billion fines cheating emissions tests,Florida,,ALCO,28.3893985748291,27.469331741333008,27.327781677246094,28.345170974731445,-3.2408817364375335,-0.5153021756037995,-3.7394835779447244,-0.15578914072829206
flood,What Does a Hurricane’s Category Tell Us?,2024-09-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/weather/hurricanes-category.html,"Florida, Hurricanes","When a hurricane threatens land, one of the top questions on people’s minds is what category is it, and that’s for good reason. Hurricanes are categorized by their wind speeds on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, which provides useful information on the storm’s winds, their expected impact and potential damage.

Hurricane Helene was nearing the coast of Florida as a Category 3 storm on Thursday evening and was expected to make landfall as a Category 4.

Hurricanes are split into five categories based on the wind speeds they generate:

Category 1: winds between 74 miles per hour and 95 m.p.h. These are considered “very dangerous winds” that will cause some damage, even tearing the roofs of “well-constructed frame homes,” and taking shingles, vinyl siding and gutters, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Category 2: winds between 96 m.p.h. and 110 m.p.h. Hurricanes at this level carry “extremely dangerous winds” that will cause vast damage, including major damage to roofs and siding and uprooting trees. A near-total loss of power is expected.

Category 3: winds between 111 m.p.h. and 129 m.p.h. This is the level at which a hurricane is considered “major,” according to the Hurricane Center, and its wind speeds indicate that “devastating damage will occur.” Homes might see major damage, such as the removal of roof decking and gable ends. Snapped or uprooted trees might block roads, while electricity and water will likely be unavailable for days or even weeks.

Category 4: winds between 130 m.p.h. and 156 m.p.h. Catastrophic damage is expected, with homes sustaining severe damage that can include losing their roofs and some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles will be downed, causing residential areas to become isolated, according to the Hurricane Center. Power outages are expected to last weeks or even months, and most of the area will be uninhabitable for that period.

Category 5: winds of 157 m.p.h. and greater. At this point, “a high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse,” according to the Hurricane Center. There will be fallen trees and downed power poles, isolating residential areas with power outages lasting for weeks or months. As with a Category 4, most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.

Every day, it seems, we get better at normalizing extreme weather. But it is simultaneously proving harder to compartmentalize — even in places such as New York City that once looked, to residents, like concrete fortresses against nature.

A month ago, when orange skies blanketed New York, it was a sign to many that this particular climate horror could no longer be conceptually quarantined as a local phenomenon of the American West, where tens of millions had already acclimated to living in the path of fire and every year breathing in some amount of its toxic smoke. That was normal for them, we New Yorkers thought, even though San Francisco had turned a sunless dark amber for the first time only in 2020. It wasn’t normal for us, we told ourselves. Then, when the air quality index dropped from 405 back into the 100s again, in the weeks after, the joggers hit the pavement at their routine times, glad the sky was merely unhealthily smoggy.

Last weekend, it was Hudson Valley streets turned into swimming pools by supercharged rain and ravines disgorging landslides that those in New York City watched with a mix of horror and false relief. The flooding was “upstate,” we told ourselves, though by “upstate,” of course, we meant not even 50 miles north of the city. It was so close that as late as Sunday morning, it seemed possible that the rains would bring a deluge to the city worse than anything in the past decade. The United States Military Academy at West Point was briefly flooded by a once-in-a-thousand-years climate event. And yet the deluge seemed so quotidian that you could’ve easily missed the alarm — as I did, not even noting the threat of a storm until a few hours before it hit.

It is always comforting to believe disasters are far away, unfolding elsewhere, but increasingly doing so means defining ever smaller increments of space as distant. In this case, New Yorkers drew comfort from the fickle path of a single local storm system. The rains had pulled just a few miles west, on Sunday, sparing New York City and instead pummeling Vermont, where government buildings acquired new moats, Main Streets became canal towns, and ski resorts were flattened by brown muddy rubble.

And Flood Resilience.,2020-04-29,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/opinion/climate-change-architecture-design.html,"California, U.S., Pacifica, Michigan, Italy, San Francisco","Taken further, the vision behind Monad Terrace’s strategy of resilience is dystopian: As water levels rise, what will happen to waterfront neighborhoods that can’t afford similar defenses? What if in some distant future, flood-resilient housing is a luxury affordable only to the privileged few?

Resilience — defending current conditions as a response to climate change, rather than fully adapting to and anticipating it — is a slippery concept, and in general it needs to be a part of any climate response. But on its own, it represents an outdated way of thinking, the idea that we can somehow stop or contain the forces of nature. It can also be exclusionary and unjust; if we can never stop or contain nature, we will just deflect it — onto those who cannot afford to get out of the way.

Instead, we should focus on equity-minded climate adaptation, on structural changes that will reimagine new urban futures under climate change. Effective adaptation will protect both the physical environment and the social fabric of neighborhoods.

The problem is that adaptation at scale requires collective action; resilience can mean simply leveraging power. Take, for example, the efforts by Peter Secchia, a Michigan businessman, Republican political donor and former U.S. ambassador to Italy, to secure funds to stop beach erosion along a stretch of Lake Michigan — along which Mr. Secchia happens to own a $6 million summer home. When at first his request failed to get a response, he wrote to lawmakers: “This lack of concern mystifies me. Our property values will diminish greatly” — adding, as if to say the quiet part out loud, “hence, our donations will also diminish.”

In California beachfront communities like Pacifica, just south of San Francisco, sea walls are going up to fortify individual homes to protect from coastal erosion. But they come with a cost, disrupting tide patterns and erasing publicly accessible beaches. The plan is controversial, and it has spurred a debate about whether managed retreat — moving inland — would be a more socially and economically viable solution. Needless to say, many opponents of managed retreat stand to benefit from the “resilient” sea walls.",resilience slippery concept general needs part climate response represents outdated way thinking idea somehow stop contain forces nature never,California,,PCG,10.865931510925293,10.457962989807129,10.587319374084473,11.084843635559082,-3.7545655492855516,1.2369175947880209,-2.564088836384493,2.0146650511617987

The weight of their task — considering the Hall of Fame worthiness of 39 Negro leagues and pre-Negro leagues players, managers, and executives — was perhaps greater than any they had carried in their careers.

“They had a speaker in the middle of the table, and Frank Robinson was brought on to talk to us,” said Leslie Heaphy, a professor of history at Kent State University, the founding editor of the Black Ball journal, and the only woman appointed to the Hall’s Special Committee on African-American Baseball. “He reminded us of how important this was, that we really had to think about what we were doing, and that the Hall of Fame isn’t just for anybody.”

The facility features backup fuel supplies and on-site sewage treatment, and its critical mechanical and electrical equipment are at least 20 feet above the 100-year floodplain, or the area that would be inundated by a severe flood.

Researchers emphasized, though, that hospital preparedness should not stop at making individual hospitals more resilient. Even if hospital buildings themselves are not flooded, the roads leading to them may still be, effectively cutting off a functional hospital from patients who are trying to reach it, Dr. Bernstein said.

In 18 of the metropolitan areas, at least half of the roads within a mile of the hospitals were at risk of flooding from a Category 2 storm, the researchers said. Hospitals cannot be “a resilient island in a fragile ocean,” said Auroop R. Ganguly, a geosciences and civil engineering professor at Northeastern University who was not involved in the study.

Dr. Bernstein also emphasized that health care providers in some major cities, like New York, Boston and Philadelphia, might face much higher risk than expected. Because of where the hospitals are located and the numbers of hospital beds relative to the populations they serve, when a storm does hit, there will be “more people searching for fewer beds,” he said.

The study contributes to a better understanding of how to characterize the damage that a hurricane can inflict on the communities it hits, said Kristie L. Ebi, a professor in the University of Washington’s Center for Health and the Global Environment who wasn’t involved in the study.

Atmospheric rivers that come in a rapid-fire procession, like those in California since late December, can be particularly dangerous. Land and streams already saturated from one downpour simply can’t accommodate water from the next one, which amplifies the potential for flooding and landslides. The most catastrophic flooding in modern California history took place in the winter of 1861, when successive weeks of powerful storms caused epochal deluges across the West Coast.

My one wish is for Twitter Inc to be the most transparent company in the world. Hi mom!”

There once was a time when broadcasting the decision to quit a job might have seemed unwise, or at least uncouth. Career coaches traditionally advised their clients not to disparage former employers online. Though there was always a subset of workers who quit loudly on principle, recruiters often raised their eyebrows at candidates who’d gone public about negative experiences in their previous roles. But after over a year of laboring through a pandemic, protests over racial justice and all the personal and societal tumult that followed those events, some workers are ready to reject stale professional norms and vent.

They were filed six days after the Supreme Court’s conservative majority struck down a New York law requiring gun owners to show a special need to carry guns in public, a decision that gun safety advocates predicted would lead to more violence.

The court’s ruling came as New York was contending with a sharp rise in gun violence during the pandemic, punctuated this year by several mass shootings. Ghost guns have been used in at least two fatal shootings in New York City, officials said, including one in April that left Angellyh Yambo, 16, dead and two other teenagers injured as they walked home from school in the Bronx.

“We will not stand by while illegal operators flout the law, endanger our communities and kill our young people,” Mayor Eric Adams said at the news conference. “We will make our voices heard and use the court system to stop this plague on our city.”

Since 2005, a federal law has shielded gun manufacturers from most lawsuits seeking to hold them responsible for shootings.

Storm-Battered Communities Are Paying a Price.,2025-03-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/musk-fema-immigrations-doge-freeze-aid.html,North Carolina,"Ms. Noem’s office has directed staff to develop a plan to disband the agency, according to a person familiar with internal deliberations who was not authorized to discuss the matter in public.

It is not clear what government agencies, if any, would take over FEMA’s role delivering aid to communities hit by disasters. Mr. Trump has mused about returning those duties to the states, or perhaps having the Defense Department carry more responsibility for responding to disasters.

In the short term, however, many communities that see FEMA grants as a lifeline are still waiting.

“There are projects beyond our ability to address on our own,” Damián J. Fernández, the president of Warren Wilson College, said earlier this month on a campus still covered in debris from the September storm, his voice breaking. “We have followed the rules. But the system is not working.”

One storm leads to another

FEMA’s existential crisis arguably began last fall, when Hurricane Helene killed more than 100 people in North Carolina and damaged more than 73,000 homes. The destruction was shocking, especially in a region not accustomed to hurricanes, and quickly became part of the presidential campaign.

Within a week of the hurricane reaching North Carolina, FEMA had provided more than $45 million in disaster relief and sent more than 1,500 personnel, according to the agency. But as survivors struggled to regain access to basic services, many concluded that FEMA was failing to do enough.",clear would happen femas role disaster relief agency criticized response hurricane katrina,North Carolina,,DUK,117.11000061035156,117.6500015258789,119.41000366210938,118.93000030517578,0.46110572343350503,1.495964397283352,1.9639680981732581,1.55409417243513

Since Donald Trump’s return to office and the rise of Elon Musk as a major political figure, there’s been intense focus on a simple set of questions: What should the government be for? Who should it help? What explains its failures? In Opinion’s latest focus group, we spoke with 14 people from North Carolina who were either directly affected last year by Hurricane Helene, or who had close friends or family members who were. Because of that event, many of them were directly confronted with these questions of government help and trust in institutions. At a time when the future of many government services could change significantly, we asked them about what Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk are doing and how other leaders, like Joe Biden, handled the crisis.

“The whole system of fixing things is broken. Everything that’s supposed to be in place is not there,” one participant said, describing his worries about not only North Carolina but also places devastated by wildfires in recent years. Some worried about FEMA’s future, even if they were deeply dissatisfied with the recovery efforts last year, others wanted to rethink it entirely, and others expressed frustration with the lack of understanding in this hyperpoliticized environment and the false claims that circulated last fall.

And at a time when people — including participants in this group — expressed real concern and worry about government cuts, layoffs and funding changes, many also expressed a skeptical and dissatisfied view of how government performs today. What does government do well?

Yet its curved white roof and champagne bronze exterior look little like the pastel-colored town homes that are the city’s signature.

The building was designed by Curtis and Davis, a local architecture firm, and meant to impress. Dave Dixon, a businessman who spearheaded the city’s effort to land a pro football team in the 1960s, wanted a stadium that would hold events but also lift New Orleans out of the shadow of Atlanta, Houston and other larger Southern cities.

Unlike most stadiums of the era, it was built on one of the city’s main thoroughfares, a short walk from hotels, restaurants and bars, and near a former cemetery, which led to rumors the Saints were hexed.

Dixon lobbied Pete Rozelle, then the commissioner of the N.F.L., for a new team. In 1966, when the league needed an antitrust exemption to merge with the A.F.L., Dixon enlisted Representative Hale Boggs, the House majority whip, and Senator Russell Long, both from Louisiana, who helped get legislation passed. In a thinly veiled quid pro quo, New Orleans was granted a franchise on All Saints’ Day around the same time and began play in 1967 in Tulane Stadium.

She was in the harried process of moving from a hotel to an apartment in the Marina del Rey section of Los Angeles because her family’s townhouse was destroyed in the Palisades fire. Her daughter, who will be 16 on Friday, was a sophomore at Palisades Charter High School, a beloved local institution of 2,900 students where “about 40 percent of the campus was damaged or destroyed,” the principal told The Los Angeles Times. Pali High is providing virtual instruction while school leaders try to find a temporary location for their students, who come from all over the city.

Kyle was especially furious and bereft because her daughter — like other Los Angeles high schoolers affected by the fire — has already had so much disruption to her young life. During Covid, Los Angeles schools stayed closed to in-person instruction longer than those of many other cities across the country. She talked about how much online learning harmed her daughter, a social butterfly, in fifth and sixth grade. “These kids suffered so much during that time period,” she said. I have heard this complaint from many parents over the past few years: California opened up hair salons and restaurants but kept schools closed, and that said everything about how the state values children and families.

“Just to have to do this again, it’s terrible,” Kyle said. “I mean, she’s traumatized from what we went through. We were stuck on the road for 45 minutes with fire on both sides of us trying to get out.” Even though her daughter was so happy at Pali — she was a cheerleader and had lots of friends — Kyle decided to enroll her at a public school in Manhattan Beach, where she will start next week. “She needs to be in school in person,” she told me.

School disruption from natural disasters is becoming more common because of climate change, and America is not ready for it. In 2023, Jonathan T.

But when the remnants of Hurricane Helene sent raging floodwaters through the mountains in late September, it upended the region’s Christmas tree industry months before the holidays.

The rain caused mudslides through the mountains, uprooting thousands of trees that had been at the end of a decade’s worth of growth and seedlings that had just started to take root. Homes, barns and facilities that supported the tree businesses were damaged or destroyed.

As climate shocks get worse, insurance companies are increasingly dropping homeowners facing risks of hurricanes, wildfires and other disasters. Now, the results of a congressional investigation, shared exclusively with The New York Times, have made it possible to see where insurance policy nonrenewals are happening — creating a new map of the climate crisis.

The insurance crisis has also spread far beyond the coasts, with rates of dropped policies jumping in many U.S. counties over the past several years.

Those spikes may come after a large disaster hits, but not always. In some places, such as Oklahoma, they coincide with growing premiums, but in others, insurers and state regulators may keep prices flat while dropping policies.

Communities deemed too dangerous to insure risk seeing property values fall, along with local tax revenue, stripping money from schools, police and other basic services. As insurers pull back from areas across the country exposed to climate change risks, where policies aren’t getting renewed is a key predictor of the disruption to come.

Nonrenewal rates rose in 46 states in 2023, a year with a record number of high-cost disasters, and many states have seen increased rates since 2018.

Hundreds or even thousands are feared dead as a result of Tropical Cyclone Chido, which barreled into Mayotte, a series of islands off the eastern coast of Africa, over the weekend. French officials have said it could take days to know the true death toll, because roughly a third of the territory’s 320,000 residents are undocumented immigrants, and many live in shanty towns.

The cyclone also slammed into Mozambique with heavy rains and strong winds, killing at least 34 people and completely or partly destroying over 35,000 houses, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Aid agencies fear that number also may increase as the scale of the disaster becomes clearer.

Officials who toured Mayotte said the devastation had spared no corner of the tiny archipelago, France’s poorest territory. Videos released by France’s interior ministry showed emergency workers sawing through fallen trees to disentangle them from power lines and clear roads.

Brushes Aside Democratic Governor to Expand Power,2024-12-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/us/politics/north-carolina-republicans-power.html,North Carolina,"State Representative Tim Moore, the departing Republican speaker of the House, said openly before the vote that the bill was meant to help his party win future elections.

“This action item today is going to be critical to making sure North Carolina continues to be able to do what it can to deliver victories for Republicans up and down the ticket and move this country in the right direction,” Mr. Moore told the Trump ally and conservative podcaster Stephen K. Bannon on Wednesday.

Lawmakers in North Carolina have a tradition of trying to lock in their political power after election losses. Democrats wielded such tactics in the 1990s, but more recently Republicans have led the way. After Mr. Cooper beat the Republican incumbent in 2016, the legislature stripped the governor’s office of key powers and reduced the number of staff members he could appoint by more than 1,000 positions.

Republicans in the state have also long used voting laws to try to gain an upper hand in elections. In 2016, a federal appeals court struck down a voter identification law passed by Republicans, saying its provisions deliberately “target African Americans with almost surgical precision.” (A less restrictive voter ID law was passed in 2018.)

The House vote on Wednesday means that the bill will now become law in North Carolina, after the State Senate voted this month to override Mr. Cooper’s veto.

It has been this way ever since Hurricane Helene swept through, unleashing flooding a story high from waterways like the Pigeon River next to the brewery. A nearby building has collapsed on itself. Down the street, all that remains of a pet store is a muck-stained concrete husk.

The need for storm aid is everywhere in western North Carolina, well beyond the roughly $877 million already approved by the state’s legislature in October. But as residents and small businesses plead for more help from state lawmakers, they have found themselves in the middle of a clash over partisan power in one of the country’s top political battlegrounds.

Last month, the Republican-controlled legislature passed a bill that was titled “disaster relief” but that appropriated no new money for areas hit by Helene, nor created the small-business grants requested by local business leaders and Gov.

The changes, included in a 131-page bill that was designed to deliver much-needed disaster relief for areas of the state devastated by Hurricane Helene, come as Republicans are likely to lose their supermajority in the legislature after defeats in this month’s elections. Josh Stein, a Democrat, will be the next governor, succeeding Roy Cooper, another Democrat.

The bill would significantly restructure the state election board, the top authority over voting in North Carolina, wresting appointment power away from the governor’s office and handing it to the state auditor, who will be a Republican next year. The change would be likely to put the board, which currently has three Democrats and two Republicans, under G.O.P. control.

The legislation would also significantly restrict the governor’s ability to fill vacancies on state courts, including the Supreme Court, by limiting the options to candidates offered by the political party of the judge leaving the seat.

“From rebuilding homes and reopening critical infrastructure, such as schools and roads, to supporting the nation’s farmers and ranchers and ensuring access to health care services, impacted communities await your response,” Mr. Biden wrote. “There can be no delay.”

Trump who spoke at the Republican National Convention this summer and made racist claims at a Trump rally last week at Madison Square Garden, said on Monday that the increased occurrence of hurricanes in the United States was a consequence of abortion — which he characterized as “human sacrifice.”

Appearing on a podcast hosted by Stephen K. Bannon, a right-wing political strategist and Trump ally who was just released from prison, Mr. Carlson repeatedly portrayed abortion — a medical procedure — as a kind of religious human sacrifice. He dismissed scientific research that links global warming to the increased potency and frequency of hurricanes, saying instead that “it’s probably abortion, actually.”

“I’m sure I’ll be attacked for saying this, but I really believe it,” Mr. Carlson said, adding, “You can’t participate in human sacrifice without consequences.”

What Happened Next Surprised Me.,2024-10-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/opinion/hurricane-milton-florida-climate-change-anxiety.html,"n’t, the United States","A recent survey of Americans ages 16 to 25 showed that 85 percent were worried about the climate crisis. The majority, 57 percent, were “very or extremely” worried. More broadly, 64 percent of Americans across all generations say they are at least “somewhat worried” about global warming. Whether you were born into this changed planet or, like me, have seen it degenerate before your very eyes, there’s plenty to fret about.

And yet, two out of every three Americans say they “rarely” or “never” discuss global warming with family and friends. That must change. My connection and level of comfort with the audience allowed me to show my emotions without fear of judgment. It might sound corny, but it was like I was speaking to family and friends. If I can do it over the airwaves, shouldn’t everyone be able to do it at the kitchen table?

If we can have more conversations about climate change and how it’s making us feel, we can share the burden and prioritize action.

Action on climate isn’t just what you can do on your own but also what you can do with others. If your neighborhood or school can switch to renewable energy, heat pumps and electric vehicles to lower their carbon footprint, it’s far more powerful than making those changes inside your household. One example is the 19-fold increase over the last five years in the size of the electric school bus fleet. Overall, the United States spent a record $248 billion in 2023 on the clean energy transition, more than triple what it was in 2018.

We must also look for more ways to scale community actions to the city, county, state and the nation. The way to demand that kind of large-scale action on climate is to identify and support elected leaders who can sway and enact climate-friendly policies.

It has flooded the state from coast to coast and knocked out power for more than three million homes and businesses. It spewed tornadoes that killed people far from the storm’s eye, destroyed homes and shredded the roof of the Tampa Bay Rays’ stadium. See a map of the storm’s path.

Last night, Milton made landfall as a Category 3 storm near Sarasota, halfway down Florida’s Gulf Coast. It has spent the night slicing across the state, weakening but remaining a hurricane. It is expected to exit into the Atlantic soon. The full extent of the damage will become clear as the sun rises.

Forecasters warned that storm surge could reach up to 13 feet, bringing a wave to the coast near Tampa Bay. Most of Florida is under a state of emergency. Several counties suspended emergency services because the conditions were too dangerous.

Hurricane season had been quiet and the number of wildfires was still below the yearly average. Insurers were beginning to hope that the cost of reinsurance — that is, insurance for insurers — would only inch up next year, instead of shooting higher as it did the previous two years.

Two major hurricanes have upended their calculations.

Total economic losses from Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene could soar over $200 billion, according to early estimates. While it’s far too soon to know exactly what portion will be covered by insurance companies, some consumer groups, lawmakers and analysts are already worried about a big hit to insurers’ finances that could ultimately affect millions of people living in the most vulnerable areas.

As climate change increases the intensity of natural disasters, insurance companies have pulled back from many high-risk areas by raising premiums or ending some types of coverage. The fallout from the two hurricanes, which landed within the span of two weeks, could accelerate that retreat. It could also further strain an already feeble federal flood insurance program that has filled in gaps for homeowners living in areas where private insurance companies no longer offer flood coverage.

Hurricane Milton, which hit Florida’s west coast as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday, did not ultimately cause the catastrophe that had been predicted for the Tampa Bay area.

hurricane,North Carolina Breaks Democrats’ Hearts,2024-11-05,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/opinion/north-carolina-harris-trump.html,North Carolina,"Robinson’s history of extremist positions and viciously bigoted comments made him the apotheosis of MAGA fury and a test case for a swing state’s tolerance for that even before a CNN report in mid-September that he had frequented a porn site where he identified himself as a “black NAZI!” and celebrated slavery. Although he denied that and later filed a lawsuit against CNN, many of the people working on his campaign quit, and many Republicans outside North Carolina effectively gave up on him.

Would that hobble Trump, who early this year called Robinson “better than Martin Luther King” but over the past month and a half pretended that Robinson never existed? That question occupied the thoughts of many political analysts, because even if a sizable group of North Carolina Republicans or Republican-leaning independents were comfortable with a Trump-Stein ticket split, a percentage of them might be so demoralized and disgusted by the Robinson fiasco that they just didn’t bother to vote — or so the thinking went.

Though Stein handily defeated Robinson — by what looked to be a margin of more than 15 percentage points — Robinson didn’t drag down Trump. North Carolina voters, known for splitting their tickets in the past, did so to an even greater extent this time around.

“North Carolina, like this country, is a complex place.” Damon Circosta, who served as the chair of the North Carolina State Board of Elections from 2019 to 2023, told me in a text message shortly after Trump was declared the victor here. “Next year, North Carolinians will have to do what we have always done — find a way to live among one another, work alongside of each other and make sense of the fact that none of us are as easily categorized as it may seem.”

Was Trump actually helped by the lies that he told and the distrust that he sowed after Hurricane Helene ripped through western North Carolina, causing catastrophic damage? That will — and should — be a focus of post-mortems on the presidential race here. He and many other prominent Republicans made all sorts of charges and promoted all manner of conspiracy theories about government officials targeting or ignoring Helene’s victims, and those grievances had so much traction — which any quick perusal of social media scarily demonstrated — that even a few Republican politicians in North Carolina spoke up and spoke out to tell people to disregard that nonsense.

What does the storm look like from above?

Satellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.

By The New York Times

Rafael is the 17th named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",rafael tropical storm gulf mexico saturday afternoon eastern time national hurricane center said tropical storm sustained wind speeds 50 miles per hour,the United States,,TRV,243.61947631835938,240.81275939941406,242.82606506347656,255.86790466308594,-1.15209053125027,0.8360460920275468,-0.32567644708586063,5.027688479520596

Some scientists have developed new metrics to try to capture a hurricane’s rain risk. But Mr. Schreck, who recently developed one such measure, said the National Hurricane Center understandably does not want to confuse the public with multiple rating scales.

Experts still hope to grow public awareness beyond the category rating. “We need to rethink how we name, categorize and talk about these things because too many people are dying,” said Kathie Dello, the state climatologist of North Carolina.

When it comes to big storms, “I never think about the category,” she said.

Hurricane Florence — one of the wettest and most destructive hurricanes to hit North Carolina — made landfall as a Category 1. And Fred, a storm that caused record-breaking flooding in western North Carolina in 2021, was a tropical storm, not a hurricane.

Even “downgraded” to a tropical storm, Helene was still deadly: Its unusually large size meant that it took longer for the storm to pass overhead, and so it rained longer.

Climate change has made living in Florida riskier, but when insurance companies try to charge actuarially fair premiums, they receive strong pushback. Nationally, the flood insurance market is so dysfunctional that the federal government has had to take over most of it. And that’s not working, either. Rates are still subsidized, though less than before, so taxpayers who live high and dry are potentially on the hook for losses by people who get flooded out, in some cases repeatedly.

So, what to do? While Florida can’t control the weather, there are things that it can do to reduce the economic damage that storms cause. It has done some of them, but there are still weaknesses in the system — and according to one recent study, a devastating hurricane in Florida could ripple all the way to the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

First the improvements: In 2019 and 2022, the State Legislature enacted laws that cracked down on insurance fraud and abuse. It was common in Florida for someone with an insurance claim to sell it for instant cash to a third party such as a roofer or a water extraction company. The new owner of the claim would sometimes do overpriced or shoddy work and then sue to get fully paid by the insurer. The reduction in so-called assignment of benefits insurance fraud and abuse has sharply slowed the rate of premium increases and allowed 15 companies to reduce their rates this year.

Under Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida has given grants totaling $250 million in the past year or so to help make homes hurricane-resistant. I don’t know if that’s sufficient, but it helps. A little money spent for protection can save a lot more when a storm hits.

There’s also been some progress on the issue of under-insurance, particularly against the risk of floods. People are required to have flood insurance to qualify for a federally regulated or insured mortgage only if where they live is estimated to have a 1 percent or higher chance of getting flooded in any given year. One carrier, Olympus Insurance, estimated that more than 850,000 Floridians in high-risk flood areas — presumably without such mortgages — don’t have flood insurance, whether they realize it or not.",devastating hurricane florida could ripple way mortgage finance giants fanie mae fredie mac florida cant control weather things reduce economic damage storms cause,Florida,10553.0,ALCO,26.83295440673828,25.966089248657227,26.25504493713379,25.916269302368164,-3.2305990050181275,1.1128194381119796,-2.153730300601442,-3.4162660230210045

High winds aren’t the only cause of destruction during a hurricane: Flooding, storm surge and tornadoes matter, too. But small-seeming jumps in a hurricane’s wind speeds can translate into big increases in damage, said Ralf Toumi, a climate scientist at Imperial College London who worked on the analysis.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a hurricane’s potential damage in the United States rises by roughly a factor of four for every increase in the storm’s category rating. Milton made landfall this week as a Category 3 storm.

Think about it this way, Dr. Toumi said: In the chaos of a hurricane, the damage multiplies.

hurricane,Hurricane Milton’s Storm Surge Risk Across Florida,2024-10-08,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/08/weather/hurricane-milton-storm-surge.html,"Florida, Tampa, Fort Myers","Hurricane Milton’s Storm Surge Risk Across Florida

As Hurricane Milton approaches landfall in Florida this week, the National Hurricane Center is releasing a series of data sets to help warn the public of the risks. Storm surge is one of the deadliest aspects of a strong hurricane as it approaches land.

Depending on exactly where Milton makes landfall, storm surge will broadly fluctuate. As it approaches the Florida coast, any minor wobble in the storm’s path could vastly change where the worst surge piles up.

The area surrounding Cedar Key is still dealing with the effects of Hurricane Helene. For now, it appears residents there will be less affected by Milton. As the forecast path adjusts, the Tampa Bay area continually seems like it will near Milton's path. The area will most likely see some large swells. Residents have been urged to evacuate. The Fort Myers area was devastated by Hurricane Ian in 2022. This area is again forecast for a storm surge above six feet across large areas. Naples and the Everglades will bear the brunt of the winds coming off the southern part of the storm. The Florida Keys are forecast to experience strong winds and storm surge mostly below six feet.

The uncertainty of the storm surge’s eventual impacts is especially true for Tampa Bay.

If Milton tracks south of Tampa Bay, there could be far less surge there than during Hurricane Helene last month, said Robert Weisberg, a professor emeritus at the University of South Florida. His work as an oceanographer — including a 2006 study on storm surges in the Tampa Bay area — helped begin the conversation about the region’s vulnerabilities.

Dr. Weisberg said there is even the potential, if Milton is far enough south, for the storm to produce a reverse surge, as Ian did, pushing water out of the bay.

If the storm were to take a jog north, it would be a far more serious situation. “I hate to imagine what could happen if it does that,” he said.

If the storm were to make landfall near Clearwater, for example, the strongest winds along the eyewall could push the surge through the mouth of the bay.

The problem with the bay is that it is very long, Dr. Weisberg said, and the hurricane storm surge is really a slope with the highest amount of water piling up where it is pushed against the shore.

In a simplified example of a surge, if you were to blow across the top of a cup of water, you could see how it piled against the edge of the cup. This is similar to how water behaves in shallow places as wind whips across its surface.

Like the cup’s edge, water cannot penetrate the land. So as it drives water into the shoreline, it piles up.

If the storm makes landfall farther north, and those winds push up the bay, all of that water would be pushed right into Tampa, and the upper reaches of the bay would have a larger surge.

On top of the surge, come the waves, which can damage structures. “If people are in the way of the waves, they’re going to die. It’s as simple as that,” Dr. Weisberg said.

Wherever Milton makes landfall, storm surge will come ashore, especially just ahead and south of the storm’s center, similar again to what occurred during Ian.

As the storm moves inland, the wind will change direction, and since the slope of the sea surface changes with the wind, some portions of the bay will get inundated first, and then later, other portions of the bay will.

The surge is a complicated evolution based on the actual geometry of the body of water it encounters.

“That’s why you really can’t generalize a storm surge from one region to another,” Dr. Weisberg said.

Complicating factors with forecasting this surge will not only be the path the storm takes and its predicted irregular shape. But as the storm approaches landfall, it will most likely encounter turbulent air that will reduce the storm’s intensity but also make it less symmetric. So exactly what wind will blow where is unknown right now.",tampa bay area expected dramatic place country watch presidential election race white house close race hillary clinton barack obama outcome election could determine,Florida,10534.0,ALCO,25.437999725341797,25.20882797241211,25.16897201538086,26.2650089263916,-0.9009031975945122,-0.1581031735186869,-1.057582014567471,3.2510779541597494

The storm submerged railroad cars and leveled trees and utility poles. Eight people died in the storm, nearly half drowned by the storm surge that inundated the shoreline.

Mr. Davis said Tampa Bay was also hit by three major storms in the 1800s, including a hurricane known as the Great Gale of 1848. That one destroyed nearly all the buildings in the area, which was then little more than a settlement of several hundred people near a military outpost, Fort Brooke.

Timing is critical, Mr. Davis said.

“This is the time of year where the tracks have a higher chance of hitting the Tampa Bay region from the Gulf of Mexico,” he said. “The previous storms that hit Tampa did just this. They formed in the Western Gulf and they went almost straight east into parts of the Florida peninsula, right around Tampa Bay.”

The 1921 storm struck in late October; the storm in 1848, in late September.

Hurricane Milton, which rapidly intensified in the Gulf of Mexico on Monday, becoming a Category 5 storm, is expected to make landfall somewhere near Tampa as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday, according to the Weather Service.

Like in 1921, the storm surge is expected to be 10 to 15 feet. The surge could be more damaging because of Hurricane Helene, which damaged barrier islands and wiped out sand dunes and beaches when it swept through last month. “Just after our latest hurricane, we are extremely vulnerable, especially to surge,” Mr. Davis said.",october 1921 population 120 tampa bay area hit category 3 storm eight people died storm nearly half drowned storm surge inundated shoreline,Florida,10529.0,ALCO,27.79945945739746,25.437999725341797,25.20882797241211,25.916269302368164,-8.494624637125012,-0.9009031975945122,-9.318999489740014,-6.774197023202112

He drove to Florida three days after Helene hit the state late last month. “But it’s worth it. We know that we’re going to get a lot of work and bring income to our families. And the biggest satisfaction is that we can help a city rebuild.”

Mr. Lopez said he planned to ride out Hurricane Milton in Florida and would very likely remain there to assist in the recovery. The storm roared back to Category 5 strength on Tuesday afternoon, and the Tampa Bay region was bracing for what could be its first direct hit from a major storm since the 1920s.

“If Milton stays on course and hits Tampa, that’s where everybody will go,” said Saket Soni, the founder and executive director of Resilience Force, a nonprofit that organizes disaster recovery workers and offers them safety training. “It’s just an enormously dense area that hasn’t faced a storm in a century.

Electric vehicles contain lithium-ion batteries, which can also be found in e-bikes and scooters, wheelchairs, golf carts, electric lawn mowers and tools like cordless drills. If these batteries are soaked in saltwater, some can ignite after floodwaters subside.

It’s a relatively rare problem, but the risk is real.

Of the 48 lithium-ion battery fires attributed to Hurricane Helene, 11 were caused by electric vehicles, said State Fire Marshal Jimmy Patronis. The rest were electric wheelchairs, hoverboards, scooters and golf carts.

Trump acknowledged Monday that he had seen no signs of cheating, even as he continued to sow doubts about the integrity of the election during a campaign swing through North Carolina.

Mr. Trump has long relentlessly contended that Democrats are conspiring to rig the election on Nov. 5, suggesting that his support is so strong that fraud is the only way he might lose. His accusation, for which he has not provided any details or proof, builds on his lie that he won the 2020 election. That claim is now at the heart of two criminal cases that accuse him of engaging in illegal activity in his effort to overturn the election four years ago.

At a news conference in a storm-damaged part of western North Carolina, Mr. Trump was asked by a reporter whether he had seen any evidence to suggest this year’s election would not be fair.

“Well, I haven’t,” Mr. Trump said. He added, referring to Democrats, “Unfortunately, I know the other side, and they are not good.

On Wednesday, with Francine barreling toward the Gulf Coast, and several other potential storms on the horizon, the Atlantic was looking increasingly more active.

As Francine moved toward landfall in Louisiana on Wednesday, forecasters were already eyeing the next storm off the coast of Africa, which could soon become the seventh named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. (If it does, it will be called Tropical Storm Gordon). There are also three other areas of interest, including one far off the coast of South Carolina, that have at least some possibility of becoming tropical storms over the next week.

(Meteorologists name a tropical storm when its sustained wind speeds reach 39 miles per hour, and a storm becomes a hurricane when winds reach 74 m.p.h.)

The system most likely to form into a storm is currently off the west coast of Africa and being called Tropical Depression 7. Over the next 24 hours, it could reach tropical storm intensity, with winds 39 miles per hour or higher, and would likely be called Gordon if nothing forms before it.

By The New York Times

Oscar is the 15th named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",remnants oscar north atlantic ocean tuesday afternoon eastern time according national hurricane center oscar 15th named storm form atlantic 2024,the United States,,TRV,263.2665710449219,257.5638427734375,257.0877990722656,255.23316955566406,-2.1661421914867054,-0.18482551589767213,-2.346964123903885,-3.0514324159625463

All three changed from more typical hurricanes into severe ones in just a day or two.

That kind of rapid intensification — to use the scientific term for it — used to be rare. In recent years, it has become more common.

And that change is a useful summary of how climate change is, and is not, affecting hurricanes.

It will be his second such visit to the state this month.

The White House typically approves disaster declarations for states after major natural disasters. The president makes the declaration after a state’s governor — in this case, Gov. Ron DeSantis — makes a request for the federal assistance.

Mr. Biden finalized the declaration on Friday, freeing up federal funding for 34 counties, as well as the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida.

Hurricane Zeta was expected to make landfall near New Orleans on Wednesday, two days after hitting Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula.

Storms are a way of life in the Gulf of Mexico, but Zeta is the 27th named storm in an exceptionally active hurricane season. This year’s tally is one shy of a record set in 2005, the year that Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and devastated the region.

Zeta was barreling through the Gulf on Wednesday morning with maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour and was expected to strengthen further before making landfall in the afternoon, the National Hurricane Center said. It may weaken as it moves across the southeastern United States on Thursday.

Parts of Louisiana are still clawing their way back from recent storms, including Hurricane Laura in late August and Hurricane Delta earlier this month. Officials in New Orleans worry that Zeta, the fifth named storm to strike the state this year, will not skirt past their city like the others.

Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana strained on Tuesday to telegraph the gravity of the threat, urging residents to brace themselves.

“It’s easy to let your guard down late in the hurricane season,” he said, “but that would be a huge mistake.”",hurricane zeta expected make landfall near new orleans wednesday 27th named storm exceptionally active hurricane season officials new orleans worry zeta skirt past city,Louisiana,,XOM,28.011568069458008,27.347362518310547,26.912748336791992,27.396564483642578,-2.3711830394517164,-1.5892361876855836,-3.92273552819807,-2.195534303150953

People in Tampa, especially, grew increasingly worried about a worst-case scenario landfall north of Tampa Bay at high tide, which would have delivered a historically destructive storm surge.

Milton quickly became one of the strongest storms ever.

Forecasters did not have Milton’s intensity right on that first go, and they assumed the storm would be a strong Category 2 at landfall. But they started dialing in on the possibility of a major hurricane, a 3 or higher, a few hours later. And that is exactly what happened: From Sunday to Monday, Milton grew from a tropical storm to one of the strongest storms ever in the Gulf of Mexico.

By 8 p.m. on Monday, its wind speeds had increased to 180 miles per hour. Based on wind speed, it joined a handful of other hurricanes that rivaled the strongest Atlantic storm ever recorded: a 1980 hurricane named Allen, which had a peak wind speed of 190 m.p.h. before it made landfall along the United States-Mexico border.

Another way to measure a storm’s strength is by how low the pressure becomes inside it. As hurricane hunter aircraft moved through Milton’s pinhole eye on Monday evening, they recorded a near-record low pressure of 897 millibars, joining only five other Atlantic hurricanes to dip below 900 millibars: Allen, Rita, the Labor Day storm of 1935, Gilbert in 1988 and Wilma.",sunday monday milton grew tropical storm one strongest storms ever gulf mexico joined handful hurricanes rivaled strongest atlantic storm ever recorded,the United States,,TRV,229.5660400390625,231.2818145751953,234.63401794433594,263.2665710449219,0.7473991082656911,1.4494020532041194,2.2076339794906428,14.680102945594637

The first named hurricane of the season, Beryl is the earliest Category 5 Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, and also the first Category 4 hurricane to form in the Atlantic in the month of June — a portent of what experts say is a hurricane season that will be much more intense than usual. It was also abnormal because of where it formed, farther south and east than is typical for storms of this magnitude.

After tearing through the Caribbean and the Yucatán Peninsula, the storm landed in southeast Texas, canceling more than a thousand flights and cutting power for more than two million residents. The storm killed at least 15 people.

Easing the problem of billion-dollar extreme weather events would require tackling both pieces of Christopher’s storm damage equation. Reducing carbon emissions and slowing global warming could decrease the likelihood of severe hurricanes and other costly climate disasters like wildfires and droughts.

One option to reduce property damage, experts said, is to strengthen building codes. Florida did so after Hurricane Andrew wreaked havoc in 1992, requiring that new structures be built to better resist high winds. Infrastructure upgrades — like sea walls to block storm surges or pumps to remove rainwater more quickly — could also help against hurricanes, but only so much.

Some experts have proposed a contentious goal: getting people to live elsewhere. The most aggressive effort to persuade Americans to leave hurricane-threatened areas may be a new program that prices federal flood insurance according to climate risk, dramatically increasing costs for people living in vulnerable places.

But relocation is a tough sell. Americans have flocked to Florida’s picturesque coast, despite its risks. “People like living somewhere pretty,” Christopher said.

There are also political challenges. Florida cities and towns rely heavily on property tax revenues, which leaves state and local officials reluctant to reduce density or to encourage relocation. They can also count on the federal government to fund recovery efforts, giving them less incentive to mitigate future damages.",easing problem biliondolar extreme weather events would require tackling pieces christophers storm damage equation reducing carbon emissions slowing global warming could decrease likelihood severe hurricanes costly climate disasters,Florida,,ALCO,29.58592414855957,29.625173568725586,28.859766006469727,25.857023239135742,0.13266247817351529,-2.5836390814056776,-2.4544041228646147,-12.60363168207938

As with previous storms, including Hurricane Ian in 2022 and Hurricane Irma in 2017, Milton posed dangers to the state’s Atlantic coast as well as its Gulf Coast, where it is expected to come ashore — a daunting prospect even for a state unhappily used to extreme weather.

By Wednesday afternoon, many hours before Milton was forecast to make landfall in the Sarasota area, tornadoes had developed in Fort Myers, to the south, and in areas as far as Miami, on the other side of the state. Hurricane warnings were in effect for counties in northeast Florida. People were boarding up homes in Orlando, nearly smack in the middle of the state.

hurricane,What were the worst hurricanes in history?,2022-06-29,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/29/climate/what-hurricanes-ever.html,"Texas, Harvey, Honduras, the United States, Galveston","There are several ways one can measure the magnitude of a hurricane, including by death toll, cost and strength. However, data becomes less available the further back in time one goes, so it is difficult to name a single hurricane that holds the title of “worst.”

The storm that caused the most deaths in recorded history was the “Great Hurricane” of 1780 in the Lesser Antilles. More than 20,000 people died, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The agency ranks Hurricane Mitch, which occurred in 1998 and killed more than 9,000 people in Central America, in second place. Mitch is followed in the ranking by Hurricane Fifi of 1974, which left more than 8,000 in Honduras dead, and a hurricane that struck Galveston, Texas, in 1900 and took around 8,000 lives.

In terms of cost, NOAA lists Katrina as the costliest hurricane to strike the United States since 1851, causing $180 billion in damage. That 2005 hurricane was followed by Harvey ($143.8 billion) and Maria ($103.5 billion) in 2017, Sandy ($80 billion) in 2012 and Ida ($76.5 billion) in 2021.

Scientists have also developed various rating systems to calculate the intensity of a hurricane, such as the Saffir-Simpson Scale, which assigns hurricanes to five categories based on wind speed, and the Hurricane Severity Index, which also takes into account the area potentially affected by the winds. In assessing the strength of a hurricane, other indicators, such as barometric pressure and storm surge, may also be considered. Because of the variety of systems and metrics, each approach may produce different outcomes.",storm caused deaths recorded history great hurricane 1780 hurricane mitch followed ranking hurricane fifi 1974 katrina costliest hurricane strike united states,Texas,,CNP,27.02012062072754,27.047988891601562,27.475257873535156,27.224470138549805,0.10313895805722374,1.5796700584503025,1.684438271746554,0.7562864751444005

On Monday night, Subtropical Storm Theta became the 29th named storm of the 2020 hurricane season, surpassing the total count from 2005.

Theta formed after Tropical Storm Eta spent the day battering Florida, causing heavy rains and flooding in the state’s south and the Keys.

The tumultuous season has raised questions about how much climate change is affecting hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean. Researchers can’t say for sure whether human-caused climate change will mean longer or more active hurricane seasons in the future, but there is broad agreement on one thing: Global warming is changing storms.

Scientists say, for example, that unusually warm Atlantic surface temperatures have helped to increase storm activity this season. The warmer ocean temperatures are “absolutely responsible for the hyperactive season,” said James P. Kossin, a climate scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “It’s very likely that human-caused climate change contributed to that anomalously warm ocean.”",subtropical storm theta becomes 29th named storm 2020 hurricane season tumultuous season raised questions much climate change affecting hurricanes,Florida,,ALCO,25.436546325683594,27.77809715270996,27.956161499023438,27.448678970336914,9.205458937096639,0.641024276553461,9.90549244020505,7.910400330651984

Most hospitals have moved key infrastructure to higher floors.

But Ms. Mayhew said there was only so much to be done in the face of a storm as powerful as Milton. “In the last few years, hospitals in Florida have had to frequently deal with these types of emergencies, but there is undoubtedly a heightened sense of concern given the magnitude of this storm and where it is likely they hit,” she said.

Lee Health, a hospital network south of Tampa, brought in 10 water tankers ahead of Milton, having learned lessons from Hurricane Ian in 2022, when municipal water service was disrupted, prompting evacuations at two of its hospitals. Though no water entered the hospital itself, flooding damaged or destroyed 400 cars in the hospital’s parking lot.

“With every storm, we learn things, and we certainly learned about the dangers of storm surge,” said Dr. Larry Antonucci, the system’s president, noting that hospital employees have been asked to consider being dropped off at the facilities by someone else, or using ride share services. “We’re confident we can get through this.”

Ms. Harris has under a month left to make her case to the American people that she should lead the nation. But even as she tries to show that she is more than Mr. Biden’s understudy, moments like these are a reminder of the awkward dance steps required of Ms. Harris to both serve a boss and seek to replace him.

While by all accounts Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden have a good working relationship, tensions have arisen in recent months between their teams of anxious advisers, who are balancing the goals — and navigating the egos — of two of the most powerful people in American politics. Both want to defeat former President Donald J. Trump. But there are questions about how visible the still-unpopular president should be in this neck-and-neck contest, especially as Ms. Harris offers herself as representing change. And every day leading up until Nov. 5 matters.

With crises bearing down, they are determined to keep any disagreements backstage.

On Wednesday, Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris received a briefing from federal officials about Hurricane Milton. The president, who was in Washington, took the lead on questioning officials. Ms. Harris attended the call virtually from New York, and later dialed into several TV networks to talk about the storm.

And it was Mr. Biden who spoke from the White House on Tuesday, warning Florida residents to “evacuate now, now,” as Ms. Harris urged them to do the same thing on ABC’s “The View.” The previous evening, Mr. Biden announced on social media that he had spoken about the storm with Florida’s Republican governor just minutes after CBS broadcast the vice president’s interview on “60 Minutes.”",tensions arisen recent months teams anxious advisers want defeat former president donald j trump,New York,,TRV,228.44532775878906,229.5660400390625,231.2818145751953,262.6417236328125,0.490582272471239,0.7473991082656911,1.2416479882666898,14.969181558456185

Big changes to electric grids and power plants are likely to take years, but activists and residents of New Orleans say officials should explore solutions that can be rolled out more quickly, especially as tens of thousands of people face days or weeks without electricity. Some activists want officials to put a priority on investments in rooftop solar, batteries and microgrids, which can power homes and commercial buildings even when the larger grid goes down.

“We keep walking by the solutions to keep people safe in their homes,” said Logan Atkinson Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer group based in New Orleans. “When these events happen, then we’re in crisis mode because instead we’re spending billions of dollars every year now to rebuild the same system that leaves people in the dark, in a dire situation.”

They’re feeling anxious about the changing climate. Well, so am I.”

Mr. Morales began his meteorology career in 1984, working for the National Weather Service and then for Univision and Telemundo, before joining NBC6 in Miami as chief meteorologist in 2009. He was among about 100 television meteorologists who were convened for briefings about climate change in 1997 during the Clinton administration, a meeting that Mr. Morales said had inspired him “to try to find a way to communicate the impending threat.” He started weaving more mentions of the impact of climate change into his weather forecasts.

Still, Mr. Morales said he had long prided himself for being a calm voice of reason who was confident he could deliver information that would help people stay out of harm’s way. That changed in recent years, as the intensity and the ferocity of storms grew at rates that were once unimaginable.

“But as the temperature of the planet increases, my confidence in forecasting storm intensity is decreasing,” he wrote in a 2023 essay for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. “Today I am no longer as comfortable in putting everyone at ease in regard to the strength of a storm. I am afraid of rapid intensification cycles happening at the drop of a hat.”

Meteorologists are among the most trusted voices in journalism, yet reporting on extreme weather caused by global warming has put some in the cross hairs of those who don’t accept climate science.

Researchers with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, the nonprofit, found that on X, the social media platform, 33 posts that contained misinformation about the flood response had together generated more than 160 million views as of Monday. The posts have driven many of the false claims that have been swirling since the remnants of Helene decimated western North Carolina with extreme flooding and mudslides.

“The speed and impact of the falsehoods and half-truths in the wake of the Hurricane Helene response illustrate just how unprepared platforms, government and the media are for the deluge of misinformation, hate and violent threats that will come in the wake of a contentious event,” the researchers wrote.

The division of emergency management also developed an app that counties could use to assign evacuees to those hotels.

Traditional school shelters will be unavoidable, at least in densely populated areas, said Frank K. Rollason, the emergency management director for Miami-Dade County. Only 20 hotels in Miami-Dade are outside of a storm evacuation zone, he said, and many might be booked with guests evacuated from coastal hotels or with crews deployed in advance to restore electricity or phone service after the storm.

“We’re looking at those, but this is the 11th hour,” Mr. Rollason said. “It’s a long shot.”

He has focused instead on how the county’s 81 shelters, the largest of which can usually accommodate up to 1,500 people, might adapt to prevent virus spread: Set aside 36 square feet per person, up from the usual 20 square feet. Stagger meal times. Empty classrooms of furniture so they could be used for large families, groups of symptomatic people or those who have tested positive for the virus. It may be possible to designate a specific shelter for those evacuees.

Mr. Rollason is not counting on rapid testing to become widely available to reliably determine which evacuees are sick. Those entering shelters will have their temperatures taken and be asked questions about symptoms and exposure when they arrive, he said — preferably indoors in some sort of anteroom so that they do not have to stand in line outside being pelted by rain.

“But they will come in,” Mr. Rollason said. “We’re not going to turn anyone away.”

Volunteers to work in the shelters alongside county employees would be difficult to come by. The state may assign its own workers or temporarily hire unemployed people, Mr. Moskowitz said.

The first is the hardest to acknowledge: No matter what you spend in vulnerable coastal areas, you can’t protect everything from every storm.

Quite simply, it is impossible to stop land loss and guarantee the safety of people so long as the climate continues to change, sea level continues to rise and warming seas create supercharged storms. It is impossible even if you spend lots of money and do it the right way, as Louisiana has done.

The state is far ahead of the rest of the country in resilience planning, construction and funding. Louisiana has a coastal master plan and a Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to safeguard its coastline. The state has spent tens of billions of dollars and plans to spend tens of billions more building levees, barrier islands, wetlands and sea walls.

Meteorologists were glued to their computers on Monday morning, watching virtual data as the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter airplane made pass after pass through the eye of Hurricane Milton. Every time it did, it found the storm’s pressure had dropped and the eyewall wind speeds had increased, indicating that it was becoming more intense by the minute.

The hurricane went from a Category 1 storm at midnight to a Category 5 hurricane by noon. And it didn’t stop there.

By 8 p.m. on Monday, the storm’s maximum sustained wind speeds had increased to 180 miles per hour, making Milton one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes ever. Based on wind speed, it joined a handful of other hurricanes to rival the strongest Atlantic storm ever recorded: a 1980 hurricane named Allen, which had a peak wind speed of 190 m.p.h. before it made landfall along the United States-Mexico border.",hurricane went category 1 storm midnight category 5 hurricane noon 8 pm monday storms maximum sustained wind speeds increased 180 miles per hour,the United States,,TRV,224.1112823486328,228.44532775878906,229.5660400390625,240.9516143798828,1.9338809562537358,0.490582272471239,2.433950505867053,7.514272309170397
hurricane,Why Hurricane Otis Caught Many By Surprise,2023-10-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/world/americas/hurricane-otis-mexico-intensity-surprise.html,Florida,"A forecaster uses several tools to create a weather forecast, not just computer models. This is why meteorologists often preach that a computer model isn’t a forecast — forecasters create forecasts, they like to say. They also use satellite data and climatological norms to help form their predictions. They use satellite images to help estimate expected wind speeds, and send hurricane hunter planes to the eye of a storm to collect real-time data.

Using some of those additional tools, forecasters had started predicting a stronger Otis than the models were suggesting — but they were still forecasting it to top out as a tropical storm.

By Monday afternoon, the models started indicating that the storm could become a hurricane, and forecasters believed that with the abundant amount of moisture in the area and warm ocean temperatures, the storm would strengthen gradually.

On Monday evening, with Otis still a tropical storm, satellite images revealed a little feature that could mean that the storm was about to intensify very quickly. But the models still weren’t showing this, so forecasters continued to predict that the storm would be a weaker hurricane.

Global tools like the American forecast model and the European model haven’t always been great about predicting storms’ rapid intensification. Hurricane-specific models were created to help, and this year they have proved useful, including predicting the rapid intensification of Hurricane Idalia well before that storm reached Florida, giving people in the state more time to prepare.",forecasters predicting otis would tropical storm satellite data climatological norms also used make predictions,Florida,,ALCO,23.496618270874023,23.526296615600586,23.546079635620117,24.9410400390625,0.1263090049147678,0.08408896794412121,0.21050418479754232,6.147360235149053

And even though we haven’t had an actual October surprise, when I go back and read that article now, it strikes me that in the past year we haven’t seen just one unpredictable event, we’ve had quite a few: the Alabama Supreme Court ruling on frozen embryos that heightened anew the debate over reproductive issues, an assassination attempt on Donald Trump that resulted in the death of a man attending one of his rallies, and a Middle East war that is entering its second year. Most prescient, perhaps, given the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and now Hurricane Milton bearing down on Florida, was this prediction offered by Alec Ross, the author of “The Raging 2020s”:

“The election outcome will not be known until more than a month afterward because of the difficulty of administering an election with millions of Americans dislocated from their homes and home states due to the storm.”

One of the predictions in the Politico article that hasn’t yet happened (but at this point might not surprise) came from the Harvard astronomy professor Avi Loeb: “Our research suggests that it’s only a matter of time before we’ll find something that signals that we’re not alone in the universe. And that will change a lot of things.”

What’s remarkable in all of this is that despite all of these moments of potential upheaval, short of actual extraterrestrial contact, events have left the political landscape for this presidential race very, very stable. It has been a close one since the Democrats confirmed their nomination of Kamala Harris — whose late entry was its own kind of surprise. Different predictive models show different levels of variation over time, but the story has been broadly the same for weeks: Ms. Harris has a slight advantage in national polls, but the race remains tighter in the battleground states that matter most this year.

Our closely divided electorate leaves little room for big swings in public opinion, given how strongly views of Mr. Trump seem to be anchoring the state of the race. His floor is high, his ceiling is low and the race is being contested in the narrow turf in between. Meanwhile, as I wrote recently, the campaigns are competing to define Ms. Harris. Yet according to a recent YouGov/Economist poll, only 3 percent of Harris voters say they are even considering the possibility of voting for Mr. Trump, and only 3 percent of Trump voters say the same about Ms. Harris.",recent article politico asked might black swan event disrupts seeming inevitability 2024 campaign,Florida,10534.0,ALCO,25.437999725341797,25.20882797241211,25.16897201538086,26.2650089263916,-0.9009031975945122,-0.1581031735186869,-1.057582014567471,3.2510779541597494

Just a reminder: It’s November.

And yes, the official Atlantic hurricane season runs through Nov. 30. But that doesn’t mean that Subtropical Storm Nicole, as the system was named on Monday, wouldn’t be a rare event if it strengthened to hurricane status over warm waters near the Bahamas and hit the United States — an outcome the forecast says is likely.

Here are some of the ways that a Hurricane Nicole would be unusual, according to Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University who studies hurricanes and their history:

This year would tie the record set in 2001 for the most Atlantic hurricane formations in November, at three.

If it were to make landfall in Florida at hurricane strength, Nicole would be the second-latest hurricane ever to hit the continental United States, after only Hurricane Kate, which made landfall in 1985 along the Florida Panhandle as a Category 2 hurricane.

It would be the latest recorded landfall ever for a hurricane on the east coast of Florida.

Even if the storm doesn’t make it to hurricane strength, Dr. Klotzbach said that if Nicole sticks to forecasts, it “would still be the strongest tropical storm to make landfall along the Florida east coast this late in the calendar year on record.”

Forecasters issued a hurricane watch on Monday for parts of the east coast of Florida. John Cangialosi, a senior hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center, said in an interview that forecasters expected a small core of hurricane-force winds to develop near the center of Nicole and an expansive tropical storm-force wind field to stretch along the Florida and Georgia coasts.",huricaneforce winds forecast parts east coast florida would secondlatest hurricane hit continental us,Florida,,ALCO,31.24430274963379,31.528886795043945,31.627010345458984,30.96954345703125,0.9108350014739626,0.31121793500956463,1.2248876183664588,-0.8793900596989942

But a new study looks at what happens after hurricanes make landfall and work their way inland. The research suggests that climate change is affecting storms during this phase of their life as well, causing them to weaken more slowly and remain destructive for longer.

The findings could have implications for how emergency-management agencies prepare for storms post-landfall.

In the study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, Lin Li and Pinaki Chakraborty of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University in Japan analyzed data from North Atlantic hurricanes that made landfall from 1967 to 2018, looking at the decay in intensity, or wind speed, of the storms in the first day after hitting land.",study looks happens hurricanes make landfall work way inland research suggests climate change affecting storms phase life findings could implications emergencymanagement agencies prepare storms,Japan,,7203.T,1279.4703369140625,1321.0218505859375,1309.049560546875,1285.4566650390625,3.2475558419034973,-0.9062900839794744,2.311833481357156,0.4678754913098138

Hurricane Ian, one of the most powerful storms to menace the United States in decades, made landfall in southeast Florida on Sept. 28 as a Category 4 storm. Along its path it washed away roads, bridges, cars, boats and homes, and knocked out power for millions of people. Officials said more than 80 people died. The New York Times writes:

The scale of the wreckage was staggering, even to Florida residents who had survived and rebuilt after other powerful hurricanes. The storm pulverized roads, toppled trees, gutted downtown storefronts and set cars afloat, leaving a soggy scar of ruined homes and businesses from the coastal cities of Naples and Fort Myers to inland communities around Orlando.

People across southwestern Florida have begun to take stock of the devastation left behind by Hurricane Ian. The damage is so extensive that, according to Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, it may take years to rebuild.

In this lesson plan, we share ideas for how teachers and students can explore both the storm’s devastating effects and the science behind this natural disaster.

2. What is a hurricane? And are hurricanes getting stronger?

A hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone — a circular storm that forms over warm waters, with very low air pressure at the center and sustained winds greater than 74 miles per hour. Hurricanes form in the North Atlantic, the northeastern Pacific, the Caribbean Sea or the Gulf of Mexico (as opposed to typhoons, which develop in the northwestern Pacific and usually affect Asia). Hurricane Ian had maximum sustained winds of around 155 miles per hour, making it a Category 4 storm (just shy of Category 5, which requires winds in excess of 157 m.p.h.).",hurricane ian made landfall southeast florida sept 28 category 4 storm along path washed away roads bridges cars boats homes lesson plan share ideas teachers students,Florida,,ALCO,27.711658477783203,27.711658477783203,28.92845916748047,29.890121459960938,0.0,4.390934200754497,4.390934200754497,7.861178658521056

hurricane,What does Hurricane Ian mean for Florida’s wildlife?,2022-09-28,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/us/florida-wildlife-hurricane-ian.html,Florida,"Florida’s native wildlife is well adapted to hurricanes, and species have all kinds of strategies for staying safe or rebounding quickly. For example, even though sea turtle nesting season overlaps with hurricane season and some eggs may be destroyed, many of the young have already hatched and crawled out to sea by the time the season really ramps up. Lots of wildlife in the state can even benefit from new habitat created by flooding and downed trees.

But increasingly, that natural resilience is compromised by two human-created problems.

First, many species are suffering declines driven by habitat loss and other factors. These depleted populations may be squeezed into limited parcels of land, making it much more difficult for them to bounce back after a storm.

Second, climate change is supercharging some hurricanes. Scientists are still learning what this means for wildlife. Bigger storms can wipe out important habitat on land and at sea.

One of Florida’s most beloved species, the manatee, can get trapped inland when floodwaters recede. As Ian progresses, experts are poised to rescue the animals when they can do so safely. They are also asking people to report stranded, injured or dead manatees to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.",floridas native wildlife well adapted hurricanes species kinds strategies staying safe rebounding quickly increasingly natural resilience compromised two humancreated problems first many species suffering declines,Florida,,ALCO,29.684247970581055,30.302263259887695,27.711658477783203,27.672407150268555,2.0819637739151498,-8.549212182225933,-6.6452399088998675,-6.777469391531697

New Orleans sat in its potential path, in what forecasters call the “cone of uncertainty.”

There was Cristobal in June, and Laura and Marco in August. September brought Sally and Beta, and Delta was bound for the city earlier this month. Yet before they made landfall, the storms swerved to the east or west, scraping New Orleans with just a glancing blow.

Nicole, the first hurricane to come ashore on the state’s Atlantic coast since Katrina in 2005, became a tropical storm shortly after making landfall as a Category 1 hurricane at around 3 a.m. south of Vero Beach. At least four deaths were attributed to the storm as it crossed the peninsula, and then swung offshore over the Gulf of Mexico and turned north, going back over land in the Big Bend region of Florida, just east of the Panhandle.

The storm mostly spared Southwest Florida, the area worst hit by Hurricane Ian, which slammed into the state as a Category 4 storm in September. But Ian was such a large system that it also damaged parts of the Atlantic coast, leaving them particularly vulnerable to Nicole, a far weaker storm.

The double whammy was most evident in Volusia County, where officials said that building inspectors had deemed 24 hotels and condominiums unsafe, leading to the evacuation of about 500 mostly older residents, according to a spokeswoman for Daytona Beach Shores.

Mr. Nelson, a retired commercial fisherman, had been living more than 300 miles west of Bayou La Batre, in the small Louisiana town of Hackberry. But a few weeks ago, Hurricane Laura roared out of the Gulf and devastated Hackberry, including Mr. Nelson’s home, a small travel trailer right on the water. His sister, Stephenie Bosarge, 63, had driven over in a U-Haul truck to take him to safety just before the storm made landfall.

“You’re looking at the last person to get out of Hackberry,” Mr. Nelson said, grinning under his cap.

Ms. Bosarge brought her older brother back to Bayou La Batre and her elevated home, set just a few yards from the water. There had been a different house on the property before Hurricane Katrina, but Katrina blew it away, along with Ms. Bosarge’s wedding bands and family photos. The Volunteers of America came through town and built her this new house. Katrina also washed away her oyster shop.

Milton is the 13th named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",milton postropical cyclone north atlantic ocean sustained wind speeds 70 miles per hour centers update thursday afternoon eastern time,Florida,10521.0,ALCO,27.79945945739746,25.437999725341797,25.20882797241211,25.16897201538086,-8.494624637125012,-0.9009031975945122,-9.318999489740014,-9.462369029325233

A 96-year-old man drowned after getting trapped under a parked car in Charlotte County. In Fort Myers Beach, the body of an 85-year-old woman was found in a tree several days after the storm.

After Hurricane Ian punched Florida last week, shredding beachfront towns and flooding large swaths of the state, the storm was blamed by state and county officials for at least 119 deaths, more than any other hurricane had caused in Florida since 1935. Officials in North Carolina linked four deaths there to the storm as well.

Though the circumstances of many of those deaths remained unclear, information released this week by state and local governments provided a distressing portrait of a hurricane that at times overwhelmed both residents and emergency responders.

At least 54 of the victims died by drowning, records showed. Nearly two-thirds of the dead were in two counties on Florida’s southwest coast, Charlotte and Lee, that faced monstrous storm surge and winds exceeding 150 miles an hour. And many of those who died were older. Of the 87 people for whom an age or approximate age has been released so far, 61 were at least 60 years old.

Since then, Ms. DeSantis has provided updates on the fund at Mr. DeSantis’s briefings and taken part in volunteer efforts aimed at storm victims. In a tweet on Wednesday, Florida’s Republican lieutenant governor said that the state’s response to Ian had been “historic” in part because of “@CaseyDeSantis’ Disaster Fund.”

“We’ve now mobilized private charities with a lot of money — and growing — to help people in really tough circumstances,” Mr. DeSantis said on Wednesday, thanking his wife, who stood a few steps away, before he introduced the president.

Before Ian, Ms. DeSantis, a former television news reporter and Golf Channel host, may have been less known outside of Florida. But she has played a starring role in her husband’s career as governor, from narrating a cheeky 2018 primary television ad in which he urged their toddler to “build the wall,” to participating in personnel interviews as he hired people to work in his administration, to keeping — at least for a time — an office in the governor’s suite at the State Capitol.

Neither has formally announced a candidacy. But Mr. Christie has made clear he is considering one, and Mr. DeSantis has become a focus of some Republican donors who are looking for an alternative to former President Donald J. Trump.

A spokesman for Mr. DeSantis declined to respond directly to Mr. Christie’s remarks or to speak with a reporter by phone. He pointed to a list of actions the State of Florida took to address the storm’s impact and remarks the governor made on Fox News.

“Nobody has done more to stand up to the administration than me in Florida over the last year and a half, as you know,” Mr. DeSantis said in the Fox News interview about his meeting with President Biden. “But you’ve got to be willing to work together to help folks.”

Mr. Christie rejected comparisons between Mr. DeSantis’s meeting Mr. Biden and his own interactions with then-President Barack Obama during the Hurricane Sandy response in 2012, suggesting that the situation then was more intense and politically fraught. At the time, Mr. Obama was an incumbent president running against Mitt Romney, whom Mr. Christie had endorsed.

While the path and damage that Nicole will leave behind is unclear, Hurricane Katrina went on to become one of the most costly natural disasters in American history. After landing north of Miami as a Category 1 in August of 2005, the storm crossed Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico, where it strengthened into a Category 5 storm and slammed into New Orleans. The storm killed more than 1,800 people in southern Louisiana and created catastrophic flooding there.

Katrina dropped 10 to 20 inches of rain on South Florida, flooding parts of the region, the National Weather Service said. The storm was also linked to nine deaths in the region.

Though it was a weaker storm when it hit Florida, it caused about $630 million in damages, according to The Florida Sun-Sentinel. More than 1 million customers were left without power as homes and streets across the region flooded.

But little progress was made in the science of hurricane prediction, and even with the advent of the telegraph and the creation of the United States Weather Bureau, forecasting remained largely a matter of luck.

For instance, the Weather Bureau called for “light rain” in the New York area on the evening of Aug. 23, 1893; instead the city was hit by a Category 1 storm. Four days later, the bureau warned that a hurricane was about to make landfall near Savannah, but by that point, the Category 3 hurricane was already bearing down on the city and even those who received the alert had no time to prepare. Particularly devastated were the islands to the northeast of Savannah, off the coast of South Carolina, which were on the “dirty,” or right-hand, side of the storm. (In the Northern Hemisphere, hurricanes rotate in a counterclockwise direction; this means that whatever direction the storm is moving, the danger will be greatest to the right of the eye, because there the speed of the winds is increased by the forward velocity of the tempest.) Some 2,000 people were killed in the so-called Sea Islands Hurricane, most of them African-American. Relief was slow to reach the islands, in part because of all the damage and in part because South Carolina’s avowedly white supremacist governor delayed calling for help.

Four decades later, communications technologies — radio, telephone — had vastly improved, but, as Dolin recounts, the bureau’s forecasts had not. In the hours before the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 made landfall, the bureau missed the fact that the storm had taken a sharp northern turn; the result was that hundreds of unemployed World War I veterans who’d been sent to build a road connecting the Florida Keys were killed. Ernest Hemingway, who rode out the Labor Day Hurricane on Key West, visited the vets’ camp, on Lower Matecumbe Key, a few days after the disaster. (He’d been drinking buddies with many of the men.) The dead, he reported, were “everywhere and in the sun all of them were beginning to be too big for their bluejeans and jackets that they could never fill when they were on the bum and hungry.”",first major hurricane 20th century hit east coast us august 31 1969 storm direct hit new york city east coast united states,New York,,TRV,103.29178619384766,102.11801147460938,103.9057388305664,107.3187255859375,-1.1363679170340404,1.7506484215093945,0.5943866974732582,3.898605630202278

One such expert, Phil Klotzbach, a researcher at Colorado State University, said in his team’s annual forecast on Thursday that they expected a remarkably busy season of 23 named storms, including 11 hurricanes — five of them potentially reaching major status, meaning Category 3 or higher.

Even though ferocious storms like Ian seem to make landfall with increasing regularity, insurers and environmentalists say that pricing the risk associated with these events will only get trickier.

Historical actuarial patterns that once helped insurers price premiums are becoming less relevant as severe weather caused by climate change becomes more frequent, said Don Bain, an engineer and senior adviser at the nonprofit group Climate Central. “The ability to price risk depends on modeling, and that modeling is stressed,” he told the DealBook newsletter.

Coastal communities could take a $108 billion hit by 2100, according to an analysis by Climate Central. Researchers predict “significant implications for both property owners and local property tax revenues” as sea levels rise and shift the tide lines that delineate boundaries between public and private property in some states. They estimate that up to 4.4 million acres may be below the relevant tidal boundary levels by 2050, with Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina and Texas most at risk.

“The Florida homeowners’ insurance market is in crisis,” said Kyle Ulrich, the head of the Florida Association of Insurance Agents, a trade group. He said that while climate change may be a factor in mounting premiums, wrinkles in state law that incentivize litigation are putting pressure on insurers’ finances.

Park had attracted tourists since the 1920s, evolving into an unofficial community hub. Like the Silver Sands, it was wiped off the map. For now, the land it stood on sits empty, but this month, the nearly 10-acre Red Coconut property was sold for $52 million to Seagate Development Group, which has developed numerous communities of multimillion-dollar homes in Southwest Florida.

Developed in response to Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and put in place in 2002, building codes require, among other things, that structures within a mile of shorelines prone to high winds have impact-resistant windows and that those in flood zones be anchored on pilings or columns clearing the height of anticipated flooding and have ground-level breakaway walls (or no ground-level walls at all) to let water pass through during floods. In cases of rebuilding after storms, if repair costs amount to at least 50 percent of a property’s value, the owner is required to rebuild in adherence to the new codes. For most homes in Fort Myers Beach, this means that rebuilding what was there before Ian isn’t an option. For a hotel development like Margaritaville, the building codes helped it weather Ian with damage from which it could recover.

Building up to code is costly — far more so than building wood-frame beach bungalows. It also requires a tolerance for risk that often only money can buy; when insurance no longer covers full rebuilding costs, mainly those with deep pockets can build on the water. That means existing property owners like those of the Silver Sands, Red Coconut and countless private homes end up cutting their losses and selling. What will go up are apparently second homes and luxury resorts that can turn a profit in a few years before another hurricane hits. (A new hotel typically pays for itself in five to 15 years, obviating the need to think about 30 years down the line, when sea levels will have risen even further.) For well-funded developers, the risk and expense can be worth it, even if it means betting on a potentially doomed parcel of land.

They’re also banking on the infinite desirability of the beachfront, as are the state authorities responsible for the building codes that allow redevelopment after hurricanes and floods. But when the beaches have to be fortified against erosion and sea level rise, taxpayers and governments are stuck with the bill.

Instead, the state could cultivate solutions that benefit a wider set of people who want to live near the coast: temporary, movable structures for tourists and residents and other ways to motivate people to move away from the riskiest places, a strategy called managed retreat. The biggest obstacle to managed retreat remains local resistance. From the Florida Keys to the Outer Banks of North Carolina to New York City, homeowners have so far largely resisted efforts to encourage relocation even as the rising tides bear down on their areas.",developed response hurricane andrew 192 put place 202 building codes require among things structures within mile shorelines impactresistant windows hotel development like margaritav,New York City,,TRV,163.3900604248047,163.3511199951172,163.05929565429688,159.42108154296875,-0.02383280206045407,-0.17864850931480333,-0.20243873442964844,-2.429143407816132

Adult paper wasps are known as capable builders, crafting nests out of plant matter and spit. It turns out those skills start early: Just before these young wasps begin a metamorphosis into maturity, most larvae sequester themselves in special nest compartments with woven seals called cocoon caps. Shine a UV flashlight on these nests and you’ll see they glow in the dark.

The glow is about three times brighter than the most intensely fluorescent land animals previously known (a green Namibian gecko and a frog from Argentina). The discovery, made in wasp nests in Vietnam, adds to a growing pantheon of surprising examples of natural fluorescence — and to the mystery of what purposes, if any, these light shows serve.

Have a glowing evening.

The guy’s politics were unclear — he was also yelling something about Israel — but it was an indication that Donald Trump’s latest lie has gone viral.

In case you missed it, Trump has been trying to exploit the natural disaster for political gain, claiming he heard that the federal government — Biden — and North Carolina’s Democratic governor are “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas.” This claim has no basis: Major rescue and recovery operations are underway, and several governors of the affected states — including Republicans — have praised federal efforts. Trump said that Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, was “having a hard time getting the president on the phone.” On the contrary, Kemp said that Biden told him “that if there’s other things we need, just to call him directly — which, I appreciate that.”

But then, at this point, Trump’s campaign rests heavily on made-up stuff. And he clearly seems to believe that he needs new material, because the old material seems to be losing some of its effectiveness.

Before I get into the disaster relief issue, let me note that Trump has been a true innovator in political dishonesty. Lots of politicians have misrepresented their personal histories or the content of their policy proposals — Trump does that, too.

The remnants of Leslie were in the North Atlantic Ocean Saturday morning Eastern time, according to the National Hurricane Center.

The system had sustained wind speeds of 50 miles per hour.

All times on the map are Eastern. By The New York Times

What does the storm look like from above?

Satellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.

By The New York Times

Where will it rain?

Flash flooding can occur well inland and away from the storm’s center. Even weaker storms can produce excessive rainfall that can flood low-lying areas.

Source: NOAA By The New York Times

Leslie is the 12th named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",remnants leslie north atlantic ocean saturday morning eastern time according national hurricane center system sustained wind speeds 50 miles per hour,the United States,,TRV,233.1265106201172,231.38099670410156,234.26705932617188,234.63401794433594,-0.74874106397104,1.2473205073799187,0.4892402425707933,0.646647745127217

Hurricane Ida will almost certainly make this situation worse, as available trucks are diverted en masse toward affected communities to deliver relief supplies. No one questions the merits of this course, but it will leave even fewer trucks available to carry goods everywhere else, intensifying already-profound shortages.

Over the next 30 years, 7.5 million more are projected to leave those perennially flooded zones, according to the study.

All of this suggests a possible boom for inland and Northern cities. But it also will leave behind large swaths of coastal and other vulnerable land where older adults and the poor are very likely to disproportionately remain.

The Southern United States stands to be especially transformed. Extreme heat, storms and coastal flooding will weigh heavily on the bottom third of this country, making the environment less comfortable and life within it more expensive and less prosperous.

The young, mobile and middle class will be more likely to leave to chase opportunity and physical and economic safety. That means government — from local to federal — must now recognize its responsibility to support the communities in climate migration’s wake. Even as an aging population left behind will require greater services, medical attention and physical accommodation, the residents that remain will reside in states that may also face diminished representation in Congress, because their communities are shrinking. Local governments could be left to fend alone, but with an evaporating tax base to work with.

In December, the First Street Foundation created one of the first clear pictures of how this demographic change is unfolding. It looked at flood risk and migration patterns down to the census tract, across the country, and identified hundreds of thousands of so-called abandonment zones where the out-migration of residents in response to rising risk had already passed a tipping point, and people were making small, local moves to higher ground.",young mobile middle class likely leave chase opportunity physical economic safety southern united states stands especially transformed,Texas,,CNP,29.499561309814453,29.657472610473633,29.904207229614258,29.104787826538086,0.5353005049829093,0.8319475579773101,1.3717014824392648,-1.338235098245433

The effects on air travel, in Florida and beyond, are likely to continue through the weekend. Here’s what to know if your travel plans are affected by Hurricane Ian.

Your flight was canceled because of the storm. What now?

Extreme weather events are outside airlines’ control, so you cannot automatically expect a full refund if your flight is canceled or significantly delayed. But some airlines, including American, Frontier and JetBlue, are offering full refunds anyway.

The sea walls, sewage pump stations, wastewater treatment plants and “living shorelines” that taxpayers funded did little to help inland towns like Arcadia. Hundreds of Central Florida homes remain flooded two weeks on, as rivers flush out the heavy rain. One study found that climate change may have added 10 percent to Ian’s rainfall.

Protecting Florida from the effects of future storms like Ian calls for more than just resilience. It calls for carefully retreating from the rising water and rebuilding where it’s safe. But retreat has never been in Governor DeSantis’s plan. There has been little to no attempt by his administration to stop further development in vulnerable coastal areas. As recently as August, Mr. DeSantis and his cabinet approved a high-rise resort development in Fort Myers Beach, where evacuation times already exceeded state regulations.

Expensive resilience projects like the ones the governor has supported can only ever be a temporary fix. As the sea level rises, they will have to be replaced, made higher, built larger. A bridge that’s been raised by a foot will have to be raised another foot and then another. The same goes for the sea walls and other infrastructure. They don’t address the cause of climate change, only the symptoms, and only for a little while.

If Governor DeSantis ever gets serious about a changing climate, the place to start is with the emissions that are also driving Florida’s other dangerous impacts: the intensifying heat waves that put outdoor workers at risk of dehydration and death, the warmer ocean waters causing rapid intensification of storms like Ian and the toxic algae blooms, which are also exacerbated by pollution.

The governor has gone in the other direction. Rather than encouraging homes and businesses to switch to renewable energy or requiring any retreat from the growing risks of climate-fueled devastation, he has taken steps to protect the oil and gas industry spewing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Last year he signed off on a bill that prevents local governments from trying to force the state’s powerful utilities to switch to cleaner energy sources. And he recently prohibited the state’s nearly $180 billion pension fund from taking environmental, social and governance metrics into account when making investment decisions.",hurricane ian revealed brutal detail inadequacy governor desantis approach sea walls sewage pump stations wastewater treatment plants living shorelines taxpayers funded little help,Florida,,ALCO,28.221927642822266,28.948083877563477,28.329870223999023,27.623342514038086,2.573021389365994,-2.135594383998612,0.382477705076999,-2.1209930673761717

He also falsely claimed that the Puerto Rican authorities were inflating the hurricane’s death toll.

The most enduring images of Mr. Trump visiting the island after Maria were of him throwing paper towels at the island’s desperate residents, as if he were shooting free throws. Three years after the hurricane’s landfall, in September 2020, Mr. Trump said he would finally release $13 billion worth of aid for Puerto Rico. The announcement came less than two months before Election Day, as the Trump campaign was chasing Puerto Rican voters in Florida in what polls at the time suggested would be a competitive race in the state.

The 2018 wildfire season was the most destructive in California’s history.

Where will it rain?

Flash flooding can occur well inland and away from the storm’s center. Even weaker storms can produce excessive rainfall that can flood low-lying areas.

Source: NOAA By The New York Times

What does the storm look like from above?

Satellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.

By The New York Times

Kirk is the 11th named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",kirk postropical cyclone north atlantic ocean monday morning eastern time national hurricane center said latest advisory,the United States,,TRV,234.16787719726562,232.19424438476562,233.18600463867188,228.44532775878906,-0.8428281607717654,0.4271252530544292,-0.41930283963184656,-2.4437807213223457

The insurance brokerage Marsh McLennan estimated that premiums on commercial properties rose an average of 11 percent across the country last year but as much as 50 percent in storm-vulnerable places like the Gulf Coast and California. This year, premiums may have doubled in some of those places, the brokerage said.

For apartment buildings, insurance costs now account for 8 percent of operating expenses, twice what they did about five years ago, said Paul Fiorilla, the director of research at Yardi Matrix, a data provider. Compared with expenses like taxes and maintenance, insurance is still a small sliver of the pie, Mr. Fiorilla said, but it is adding to the strain caused by stagnating rents and higher borrowing costs. Landlords’ operating expenses grew faster last year than their income, he said.

Lenders are worried.

“We’re constantly hearing from our banks,” said Kevin Kaseff, a co-founder and the managing partner of Titan Real Estate Investment Group, a California-based owner of living facilities for seniors and cold-storage buildings for fruits and vegetables bound for supermarkets.

The lenders have been asking for details about how he is getting insurance, Mr. Kaseff said, particularly on buildings in California, where some insurers have stopped doing new business.",insurance premiums commercial properties rose average 11 percent last year year premiums may doubled places marsh mclenan says apartment buildings insurance costs account 8 percent operating expenses,New York,,TRV,224.1112823486328,228.44532775878906,229.5660400390625,240.9516143798828,1.9338809562537358,0.490582272471239,2.433950505867053,7.514272309170397

The remnants of Joyce were in the North Atlantic Ocean late Monday Eastern time, according to the National Hurricane Center.

The system had sustained wind speeds of 35 miles per hour.

All times on the map are Eastern. By The New York Times

What does the storm look like from above?

Satellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.

By The New York Times

Joyce is the 10th named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",remnants joyce north atlantic ocean late monday eastern time according national hurricane center system sustained wind speeds 35 miles per hour,the United States,,TRV,234.10836791992188,234.16787719726562,232.19424438476562,233.18601989746094,0.025419543040044384,-0.8428281607717654,-0.817622860798802,-0.3939833636260418

If you lack flood insurance, especially if you live near the coast, this is the time to consider it.

Standard homeowner insurance policies don’t cover damage from flooding, so you’ll need to buy a separate policy to protect your property. Most flood policies in the United States are issued through the National Flood Insurance Program, managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency — although options are increasingly available from private insurers in some areas.

FEMA is scheduled to change the way it prices policies beginning this fall, as part of an overhaul of the flood insurance program to better reflect climate risks. Some members of Congress, however, have signaled opposition to the changes, citing concerns about affordability. The aim is to more accurately reflect the risks that homeowners face, but some people may end up paying much higher rates.

Mr. Hembree, who is retired from a job cleaning oil tankers and uses a wheelchair, was staying at a shelter at Erwin Technical College that had been designated for people with special needs.

“I live two blocks from the Hillsborough River,” he said as he took a drag of a cigarillo outside the building. “We’re not going through this again.”

Instead of bringing storm surge to Tampa Bay — one of forecasters’ biggest fears when it comes to storms hitting Florida — Hurricane Ian pushed the water out, leaving it less than a foot deep in some areas. The phenomenon, which also occurred during Hurricane Irma, is sometimes referred to as a reverse, or negative, storm surge. Winds to the north of the storm blew in from the east, pushing water away from the shoreline, said Christopher Slocum, a physical scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Florida has one of the most rigorous building codes in the country, a result of construction rules adopted after Hurricane Andrew destroyed tens of thousands of homes in South Florida in 1992. In more recent storms, such as Hurricane Irma, structures built under modern codes have performed better than older buildings. By contrast, in states without mandatory and up-to-date building codes, such as Tennessee and Kentucky, the damage from extreme weather events tends to be far worse.

Depending on how much damage the storm causes, it could also threaten Florida’s insurance market — and recent research suggests that market is dangerously vulnerable.

Catastrophic storms have crippled Florida’s insurance market in the past, including after Hurricane Andrew struck near Miami in 1992, leaving about a dozen insurers insolvent and causing many national insurance companies to flee the state. Florida’s insurance market is now dominated by small insurers, which often have less money in the bank than big national carriers — making them more vulnerable to collapse in the face of too many insurance claims.

Last year, researchers at Columbia, Harvard and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board sounded the alarm about Florida and the home insurance industry. In a paper, they warned that the stability of Florida’s insurers was worse than it seemed, because those insurers appeared to be getting inflated scores from the company charged with evaluating their financial health.

Ocean heat content is a sort of fuel for hurricanes — the higher the amount, the greater the influence it can have on storms like Helene.

The water Helene was traversing Thursday is roughly the ideal temperature for a warm bath. The storm is moving directly over the Loop Current — a steady, strong current of warmer water that moves from the Caribbean and loops like a horseshoe in the eastern Gulf before moving through the straights of Florida. Storms traversing the Loop Current, like Hurricane Michael in October 2018, often get enough energy from the warm water to rapidly intensify.

In addition to the warm ocean temperature, storms tend to intensify “when winds don’t change a lot with height,” Mr. McNoldy said. Wind shear can separate the top of the center of the storm from the bottom, which keeps the eye from strengthening. With little shear forecast over the Gulf Thursday, the storm will likely intensify quickly.

At a storm briefing on Tuesday morning, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida expressed concern over the speed of the storm’s development.

“They’ve never in their history forecasted a major hurricane at this stage of development,” he said. “When it’s over the Gulf, especially the more north it goes rather than east, it has a chance to have a rapid intensification.”",water helene traversing thursday roughly ideal temperature warm bath month gulf mexico obliterating records ocean heat content,Florida,,ALCO,27.849279403686523,27.849279403686523,27.889135360717773,27.79945945739746,0.0,0.14311306390920156,0.14311306390920156,-0.17889132988650194

The pecan crop is particularly vulnerable. Georgia produces 88 million pounds of pecans a year, more than any other state, according to the University of Georgia. The $400 million crop is mostly in the southern part of the state, which places it in the direct path of the storm.

Farmers who are just starting to harvest nuts in anticipation of the holiday baking season are worried. The big concern is wind, which can both blow nuts off branches before they are harvested and knock down trees. The earliest varieties were already being harvested, but most of the crop is usually gathered in October.

Isaac was a tropical storm in the North Atlantic Ocean early Monday Eastern time, the National Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory.

The tropical storm had sustained wind speeds of 65 miles per hour.

All times on the map are Eastern. By The New York Times

What does the storm look like from above?

Satellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.

By The New York Times

Where will it rain?

Flash flooding can occur well inland and away from the storm’s center. Even weaker storms can produce excessive rainfall that can flood low-lying areas.

Source: NOAA By The New York Times

Isaac is the ninth named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",isaac tropical storm north atlantic ocean early monday eastern time tropical storm sustained wind speeds 65 miles per hour,the United States,,TRV,234.37615966796875,234.10836791992188,234.16787719726562,234.26705932617188,-0.11425724716466247,0.025419543040044384,-0.08886674779473747,-0.04654924884486249

Now It’s Bracing for More.,2021-03-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/us/politics/georgia-republicans-voting-rights.html,"America, Georgia","Why does seemingly every politically interested observer in America have — à la Ray Charles — Georgia on their mind?

The landmark event was President Biden’s becoming the first Democrat at the top of the ticket to carry Georgia since 1992, in what was the most closely decided state in last year’s presidential race. Former President Donald J. Trump appeared especially fixated on the state and made it the main focus of his efforts to reverse the results of the national election. Georgia then played host to double runoff contests in January that flipped control of the Senate to Democrats.

The fervor and spotlight will endure: The state is a focal point for the nation’s persistent voting rights battle, as Republicans move swiftly to roll back ballot access in what opponents say is clear targeting of Black voters with echoes of Jim Crow-era disenfranchisement.

In 2022, the Peach State’s race for governor is likely to include perhaps the Democratic Party’s leading champion of voting rights, Stacey Abrams, in a replay of the 2018 grudge match between her and Gov. Brian Kemp, the Republican incumbent. One of the two Democrats who won their races in January, Senator Raphael Warnock, will also have to turn around and defend his seat next year in a race that Republicans are already eyeing as they seek to reclaim the chamber. Several local and national Republicans — including Mr. Trump — have tried to recruit the former University of Georgia football legend Herschel Walker to run for the seat, which could lend another wrinkle to the state’s political story, as if it needed one.

Adding to the chaos, Mr. Kemp has become the target of a vendetta by Mr. Trump, who has condemned him for not doing more to deliver (or poach) victory for him in Georgia in November. This has also made Georgia the unquestioned center of the internal disputes that have roiled the Republican Party since November. Mr. Trump has seemed intent on making the state a key stop on a revenge tour he has waged against Republicans he has deemed insufficiently loyal to him — Mr. Kemp and Mr. Raffensperger chief among them.",president biden became first democrat top ticket carry georgia since 192 state focal point nations persistent voting rights battle,America,,TRV,144.76309204101562,144.82749938964844,144.02671813964844,145.3613739013672,0.04449155356156941,-0.5529207183544287,-0.508675167810419,0.41328342184211686

BAYOU LA BATRE, Ala. — Hurricane Sally parked itself over the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, churning slowly and lumbering at a sluggish pace toward land, representing a climate change reality that has made many hurricanes wetter, slower and more dangerous.

Sally’s outer bands unleashed a relentless rain that began in the morning and continued unabated all day and into the night, threatening to deluge coastal communities in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi. Meteorologists worried — and almost marveled — as the storm pushed forward at a speed of just 2 miles per hour, shifting erratically in its path and intensity.

Scientists saw Sally’s stall over the warm waters of the Gulf as yet another effect of climate change in the United States, coming as wildfires along the West Coast have incinerated millions of acres and sent foul air into the atmosphere as far away as Washington, D.C.

hurricane,Here’s How the Forecast for Tropical Storm Helene Is Shaping Up,2024-09-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/weather/forecast-helene-storm.html,Florida,"When potential tropical cyclone 9 officially became Tropical Storm Helene late on Tuesday morning, forecasters who had been watching the storm’s recent development from a swirl of thunderstorms in the western Caribbean Sea were able to begin piecing together more information about how big Helene might grow — and where it might go next.

Helene’s center was identified late on Tuesday morning, and that can have a significant influence on the forecast track of the storm. It gives forecasters and computer models a more accurate place to start from. And so the puzzle pieces began to fit together enough for forecasters to have some confidence in saying that Helene will likely turn into a major hurricane before making landfall along Florida’s Big Bend.

The storm’s center can wobble and move before it strengthens into a hurricane, said John Cangialosi, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Weather Service, on Tuesday. The track guidance from weather models is very tightly clustered, which typically means forecasters would have strong confidence in where the storm will go. Until now, it has not been easy to locate a center, and those models might be off slightly. So forecasters warned in an update on Tuesday to prepare for the possibility that the entire guidance could shift east or west.

Some models show the storm growing weaker and tracking west, and others much stronger and east. At the same time, most show something in between and point at the Big Bend. All of these solutions are on the table, and a high-altitude hurricane hunter flight took off from Florida early on Tuesday afternoon to investigate the steering currents and hopefully provide data that will help the later computer models.",helenes center identified late tuesday morning significant influence forecast track storm track guidance weather models tightly clustered typically means forecasters would strong,Florida,,ALCO,27.998470306396484,27.630464553833008,27.849279403686523,27.19165802001953,-1.314378066145287,0.7919333003873102,-0.5328537633567683,-2.881629880303247

They started out as friends who bonded as “nerd engineers,” Mr. Hayes said. He earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from Pennsylvania State University, and she received a bachelor’s in chemical engineering from M.I.T. They now both live in Lower Manhattan and work for business consulting firms: Mr. Hayes is an associate at McKinsey & Company, and Ms. Brew is a senior manager at ENGIE Impact.

While their chemistry was instantaneous, Ms. Brew was not looking to jump into a relationship at the time. But Mr. Hayes still made up excuses to visit her cubicle, asking work-related questions that he already knew the answers to.

For several months, they hung out with groups of friends, who could all tell the two were destined to date. A few days before they were both slated to attend SantaCon San Francisco, Ms. Brew brought up her “secret” feelings for Mr. Hayes with her roommate.

“Oh my gosh, I think I like Robert,” Ms. Brew recalled saying. “And she was like, ‘Well, duh.’” And although it wasn’t the most intimate setting, Ms. Brew and Mr. Hayes shared their first kiss at a SantaCon party.

The two began dating and eventually wanted to move back to the East Coast — Ms. Brew is from New Hampshire, and Mr. Hayes is from New Jersey.

Team Rubicon, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit led by military veterans, helped people remove muck and debris from their houses, she said. “They saw me using this ladder to get in and out of my house, so they were like, ‘Why don’t we build you a staircase?’” Operation Blessing, a faith-based humanitarian nonprofit, organized teams of volunteers to do everything from plumbing work to throwing Halloween parties for children. They didn’t leave the Rockaways until January. (Both groups are now on the ground in Florida.)

Recalling the monumental assistance she had received from these groups, Ms. Fogarty opted to stay put in New York after Hurricane Ian, and to donate money to both nonprofits instead. “I decided they didn’t need an almost 60-year-old to show up,” she said. “These were the people who were the most helpful and who were here the longest.”

For John Cori, a Rockaways resident whose house had $250,000 worth of damage after Hurricane Sandy, one of the biggest challenges was dealing with the insurance companies, he said.

After Hurricane Ian, he turned to the Friends of Rockaway Beach Facebook page to collect advice for Floridians about what worked (and didn’t) when dealing with insurance companies. Followers suggested everything from hiring contractors immediately to recruiting an independent insurance adjuster. He passed the tips along to his friends who lived in Florida and encouraged everyone in the almost 38,000-member group to do the same.

Your Homeowner’s Policy Probably Won’t Cover That.,2021-09-10,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/your-money/ida-flood-damage-insurance-policy.html,"Louisiana, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina","Fortunately, standard homeowner’s insurance policies do typically cover damage from high winds — like blown-off roofs, shingles or siding, or blown-in rain. If your property was affected by both wind and flood, you may be eligible for living expenses from your policy, Mr. Hunter said.

Here are some questions and answers about flood insurance:

What if I’m not satisfied with my flood claim?

If you feel your payout is too low, you can dispute it. You can ask the adjuster’s supervisor to reconsider your claim, or you can file a request with the insurer for a new review. If you still disagree, you can file a written appeal with FEMA within 60 days of the insurer’s denial letter.

In cases of serious damage, you could consider hiring a public insurance adjuster — a professional adjuster who represents you rather than the insurer. In most states, public adjusters work on a contingency fee, meaning they aren’t paid upfront but take a cut of the settlement — often 15 percent. (Louisiana doesn’t allow contingency fees, so adjusters typically charge a flat or hourly fee.) Because the fee can be steep, the consumer federation doesn’t recommend immediately hiring public adjusters, Mr. Hunter said.

But insurers may seek to delay paying claims or deny them, hoping that policyholders will give up and accept the initial payout, said Anita Taff, the president of the National Association of Public Insurance Adjusters. Insurance policies can be complex, she said, and the federal flood program has deadlines that must be met to protect your claim. So an adjuster can help keep you on track. Typically, she said, an initial consultation with a public adjuster is free. If you do want to consider hiring one, you can search on the association’s website for member adjusters, who agree to the group’s rules for conduct and training.

Do I need flood insurance if my home isn’t in a high-risk area?

Increasingly, it’s wise to consider coverage even in areas that haven’t previously been prone to catastrophic flooding, experts say. “Flash flooding can occur on a stream that’s not mapped” on federal flood documents, Mr. Hunter said. Last month in Tennessee, for example, flash floods devastated rural areas where the proportion of properties with flood insurance is relatively low, Mr. Maurstad said.

What if I am having trouble paying my insurance deductible?

Flood and homeowner’s insurance policies typically carry deductibles — an amount deducted from your claim payout. Some states, including South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi, offer “catastrophe” savings accounts, which clients can deposit to tax-free. The funds can be used to pay for insurance deductibles and uninsured losses from hurricanes, floods and windstorms.",property affected wind flood may eligible living expenses policy public adjusters work contingency fee meaning arent paid upfront take cut settlement,Louisiana,,XOM,47.57828903198242,47.481529235839844,48.704185485839844,48.009300231933594,-0.2033696421439947,2.5750144733694023,2.3664080335057602,0.9058989062457531

But this time, there was added urgency: Another storm, one predicted to be even more powerful, is expected to pummel the same stretch of the coast not even 48 hours later.

NEW ORLEANS — The Gulf Coast was bracing yet again on Monday for a barrage of storm surge and pounding rain as Hurricane Sally lurched toward the region less than a month after Hurricane Laura’s powerful winds pulverized a section of the coast.

With Sally, officials warned of a storm whose threat came, in part, from its sluggish speed, with the extended time it percolates in the Gulf of Mexico able to intensify its scope and severity. The slow-moving storm, which grew to Category 2 hurricane strength on Monday, could dump 20 inches of rain in some places, in addition to delivering as much as 11 feet in storm surge.

A ‘do-over’ weekend

The possibility that Ida is the event that will finally push visitors over the edge, keeping them away long-term, is what has some in the hospitality sector scared. After Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, the number of tourists in the city plummeted more than 60 percent. It wasn’t until 2010 that the number of visitors reached pre-Katrina numbers again.

“We want people to understand this was not a Hurricane Katrina event for New Orleans,” said Kelly Schulz, a spokeswoman for New Orleans & Company, the official marketing organization for the New Orleans tourism industry. Because businesses and homes in the city did not take on water — as some lamentably did in other parts of Louisiana and Mississippi — the tourist infrastructure was generally undamaged, and she said she hoped that tourists would return as soon as the power is back on.

Given that intensive care units in the city have been overflowing with young Covid patients and only 40 percent of people are fully vaccinated in Louisiana, some might argue that the city is better off without an influx of crowds. Epidemiologists have blamed Mardi Gras in February 2020 for creating one of the most explosive outbreaks of coronavirus in the world.

But restaurant owners, hotel managers and event planners say given that the city now requires proof of vaccination or a recent coronavirus test along with masks to enter most businesses, they could have handled the visitors, had the storm given them the opportunity.",hurricane katrina hit 205 number tourists city plummeted 60 percent covid didnt ida took care said tony legio one,Louisiana,,XOM,47.296810150146484,48.449100494384766,48.264381408691406,47.48152542114258,2.4362961066090256,-0.38126422123103865,2.0457431600002423,0.3905448811657791

By The New York Times

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",gordon tropical depression north atlantic ocean late monday eastern time national hurricane center said tropical depression sustained wind speeds 35 miles per hour,the United States,,TRV,232.184326171875,235.8737335205078,240.2672882080078,239.55320739746094,1.588999313373858,1.8626722958612119,3.4812694592267093,3.173720357045594

Typically, storms in the North Central Pacific that have wandered in from near North America keep their original names, as determined by the World Meteorological Association. Storms are given a traditional Hawaiian name when they form in the Central Pacific.

Storms often come close to Hawaii and affect the weather, but a direct landfall of a named storm on a Hawaiian island is rare since the land area is relatively small. Even a brush from one of these storms can cause problems. In 2020, Hurricane Douglas didn’t make a direct hit on the islands, but it produced damaging winds.

Warm water is pushed east during years with El Niño, a large-scale weather pattern in the equatorial Pacific. That brings warmer water closer to Hawaii and provides a breeding ground for storms to form in the Central Pacific.

El Niño also increases the number of named storms in the Eastern Pacific by reducing the amount of wind shear in the region. Wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — tears apart storms and can keep them from intensifying or even developing.

The accumulating wear and tear on the components that hold the grid together, combined with weather that has often been hotter and stormier in some regions, means the wildfires and sustained blackouts may be a preview of how an aging grid could falter spectacularly as weather becomes more extreme and demand for electricity continues to rise.

The National Academy of Engineering calls the power grid the most important innovation of the 20th century, and with the greater electrification of society it will become even more critical. The sprawling system of transmission lines, power plants and transformers connects communities across the United States. Many of the components that tie the system together — utility poles, transmission towers and power lines — haven’t been modernized or upgraded since they were built, often decades ago. The consequences of this neglect, as we have seen, can be catastrophic.

This past spring, a decayed utility pole broke in high winds in the Texas Panhandle, causing power wires to fall on dry grass and igniting the largest fire in the state’s history. Two people died and more than one million acres burned. The Maui wildfire that killed more than 100 people and destroyed the historic town of Lahaina last year began after winds knocked down power lines, also igniting dry grass. The 2018 Paradise fire in California started when a live wire broke free of a tower that was a quarter-century past what the utility Pacific Gas & Electric considered its “useful life.” Eighty-five people died and nearly 14,000 homes were destroyed.",national academy engineering calls power grid important innovation 20th century sprawling system transmission lines power plants transformers connects communities across united states many components tie system together,Hawaii,,HE,13.369999885559082,12.220000267028809,12.0,11.640000343322754,-8.601343518128122,-1.80032947808028,-10.246820473340595,-12.939413291281312

What does the storm look like from above?

Satellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.

By The New York Times

Ernesto is the fifth named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.

In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.

This season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms — including an early storm later given the official name of “Unnamed.” It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.

Typically, the El Niño pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Niño’s usual effect of thwarting storms.

The warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year’s season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters’ confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.

To make matters worse, the El Niño pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.

Hurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Niño increases the amount of wind shear — a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Niño this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.",postropical cyclone sustained wind speeds 70 miles per hour season follows overly active year 20 named storms,the United States,,TRV,209.8144989013672,207.0989990234375,208.2345733642578,214.2975616455078,-1.2942384306845407,0.5483243985606125,-0.7530106572149194,2.136679194057076

Some 6,000 aftershocks followed.

The tsunami that rose from this great shifting of tectonic plates reached over 115 feet in some places and ultimately killed about 230,000 people in Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, the Maldives and East Africa. If there had been a natural hazards misery index, it would have registered off the scale.

About one in 28,000 people on Earth perished that day because governments were ill equipped to warn residents and visitors about the coming wave and guide them to safe evacuation routes. India failed to warn people on its eastern coast even after the tsunami wreaked havoc in the Andaman Islands, hours before striking the mainland. In Phuket, Thailand, tourists who were mesmerized by the sudden withdrawal of water roamed the exposed seafloor and then were caught unaware by the rushing water. In the Maldives, men asked women and children to stay indoors, where they could not escape the flooding.

An earthquake with similar force would have been devastating on the faults that run under highly populated areas of California, such as the Hayward fault that runs through Berkeley, Oakland and many other cities just east of San Francisco, Dr. Jones said.

The tectonic rupture that caused Thursday’s earthquake was almost purely horizontal, meaning that two faults had slid past each other. Scientists call this kind of earthquake a “strike slip,” and it is unlikely to cause major tsunamis. That raised questions about why warnings were sent telling residents they were “in danger” and should move to high ground.

But beginning around age 50, many people living with the virus face a host of health problems, from heart disease and diabetes to social isolation and cognitive decline.

And so the medical research community, which some three decades ago developed lifesaving drugs to keep the virus at bay, is now hunting for new ways to keep people with H.I.V. healthier in their later years.

A recent study, for example, showed that a statin drug significantly lowered the risk of heart attacks and strokes among middle-aged and older adults with H.I.V., and may reveal biological insights into why this group tends to age faster than others. And a crop of academic hospitals have established specialized clinics for older people with the virus, offering medical experts as well as social workers, substance abuse counselors, psychologists and nutritionists.

“I have been unbelievably impressed at how care for the older H.I.V. population has really exploded,” said Dr. Nathan Goldstein, who heads one such clinic at Mount Sinai in New York City. “I get emails every day about new models, new grant funding.

But in a matter of weeks it will be hit by a wave that a top health official predicts could infect many hundreds of millions of people.

This week, Beijing took its biggest step toward living with Covid, all but abandoning an unpopular and costly “zero Covid” policy of lockdowns and mass quarantines it had hoped would eliminate infections. The abrupt pivot has raised the specter of tremendous strain on a health care system that is overstretched even in normal times. That could get worse in a month, when people travel across the country to see their families during the Lunar New Year holiday.

Feng Zijian, an adviser on China’s Covid task force, said this week that the surge could infect 60 percent of the country’s 1.4 billion population — or more than 840 million people. For most Chinese, it will be their first encounter with Covid.

Like many countries, China is now facing Omicron variants that are highly infectious, but have so far been milder than earlier iterations. Unlike the rest of the world, China had nearly three years to prepare for this surge. But it spent most of that time focusing on lockdowns instead of on vaccinations and preparing the population for living with Covid, a prospect that many experts had warned would be inevitable.",recently china worlds last covid holdout matter weeks hit wave top health official predicts could infect many hundreds millions people beijing took,China,,0700.HK,304.4339294433594,296.9539489746094,297.70196533203125,303.8729553222656,-2.457012752299565,0.2518964169376421,-2.2113054624486663,-0.18426793692787796
tsunami,What’s Between 30 Million Americans and an Eviction Tsunami?,2020-12-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/02/opinion/eviction-moratorium-ending.html,Los Angeles,"Cue the vulture investors who have been circling from the start. Private equity entered the pandemic with more “dry powder” than ever before. That’s the industry term for money earmarked for a certain type of investment, like real estate, but not yet invested. It’s money waiting for a great opportunity, one that the Trump administration’s catastrophic management of the pandemic will surely provide. During the last financial crisis, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made millions buying a failed bank that proceeded to foreclose on homeowners using methods that regulators accused of being “unsafe or unsound.” Other private equity funds amassed foreclosed homes and created single-family rental home empires. As the home values recovered, private equity cashed out of the companies, reaping maximum profits. Now those rental companies, like Invitation Homes, which has 80,000 houses concentrated in 17 markets, told investors that it hopes to ramp up acquisitions.

As of September, 9 percent of the nation’s 48 million homeowners with mortgages were behind on their housing payments, according to the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey. By late October, close to 6 percent of those with mortgages were in forbearance. Many are house rich and cash poor. Distressed sales are expected, leaving housing stock up for grabs at a time when most Americans cannot afford to take on new mortgages. Black and Latino people, who disproportionately work in service industries most impacted by the pandemic and who were deprived of generational wealth by racist housing policies, are most at risk.

The easiest way to prevent distressed sales and corporate acquisitions is to empower individuals. One efficient solution would be a short-term universal basic income for everyone who falls below a certain threshold. The $1,200 stimulus check was that. And the $600 weekly supplement to unemployment insurance was essentially that, too. Both were extremely effective. The majority of recipients used some of that money toward rent or mortgage payments. Because the supplement wasn’t earmarked for housing, it didn’t create openings for landlords or other entities to exploit, and the housing market wasn’t adversely affected. In July, the share of apartment households who didn’t pay rent increased by only roughly one percentage point compared to last year, from 3.4 to 4.3 percent, according to a survey of 11.5 million units. The problem with the supplement was that it was tied to being unemployed, leading some to turn down low-paying or part-time work that paid less.

Another viable (and more moderate) plan calls for the government to finance 10-year-long low-interest-rate loans to tenants so that they can pay their accrued back rent. The program, proposed by Gary Painter, director of the U.S.C. Price Center for Social Innovation and the Homelessness Policy Research Institute, ideally would be progressively subsidized and negotiated with landlords. That would mean those with lower incomes who rent modest, lower-cost places would pay a smaller percentage of their accrued rental liability than those with higher incomes who rent fancier places. The key would be to make the application as accessible and easy as possible. “Everyone would be giving up something,” Mr. Painter told me. “The tenants would have to pay something. Landlords aren’t going to be happy because they’d only get a percentage of the rent. But in the long run, if you had a plan, everyone could negotiate accordingly.”

Most critically: For those properties that do hit the market, especially hotel and apartment buildings, we need a government-sponsored affordable housing acquisition fund and legislation that gives it first priority to scoop up properties. The cost of not acting is too high. In 2018, there were only 10 million affordable rentals on the private market and almost 18 million households with very low incomes that needed them. Without government intervention, affordable units are prone to be converted into condos, further vexing the rental situation in cities like Los Angeles, which already have low vacancy rates.",private equity entered pandemic dry powder ever says julian zelizer distressed sales expected leaving housing stock grabs says,Los Angeles,,TRV,121.36287689208984,121.93600463867188,122.89114379882812,125.1513671875,0.4722430460276823,0.7833118388506954,1.2592540205660618,3.1216220251425844

Japan has long expected a major earthquake to occur along the Nankai Trough off its eastern coast. As of last year, researchers said there was a 60 percent chance that an earthquake of magnitude 8 to 9 — even more devastating than the one in 2011 that laid waste to the country’s northeast coast and knocked out cooling systems at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant — would occur in the trough area over the next 20 years.

Why are there so many earthquakes in Puerto Rico right now?

At about three times the size of Rhode Island, Puerto Rico is squeezed between the border of the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates.

The Puerto Rico Trench, north of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, is an undersea fault zone. The North American plate is sliding under the Caribbean plate there, creating the potential for earthquakes and undersea landslides that can set off tsunamis.

“We’re just as likely to have earthquakes as a place like California, Japan, New Zealand, Alaska,” said Elizabeth Vanacore, a seismologist with the Puerto Rico Seismic Network.

When the tectonic plates in the region slide past each other and squeeze together, energy and stress build up until one side of a fault pops up, unleashing an earthquake.

In the two years since Japan announced its plan to release the wastewater into the sea, the plan has provoked serious political tensions with nearby China and South Korea, as well as anxiety at home. The Chinese government had previously criticized the plan as unsafe; in South Korea, the administration of President Yoon Suk Yeol supports Japan’s efforts, but opposition lawmakers have castigated the move as a potential threat to humans. Within Japan, fishermen’s unions fear that public anxiety about the safety of the water could affect their livelihoods.

Background

Ever since a huge earthquake and tsunami in 2011 led to a meltdown at the Fukushima plant, Tepco, as the power company is known, has used water to cool the ruined nuclear fuel rods that remain too hot to remove. As the water passes through the reactors, it picks up nuclear materials. The power company runs the cooling water through treatment plants that remove most radioactive nuclides except for tritium, which the International Atomic Energy Agency said in July will not pose a serious health threat to humans if released to the ocean.

The Japanese government has said that with more than 1.34 million tons of wastewater already accumulated on site, the power company will shortly run out of storage room and that it has no choice but to release the water into the ocean.

What’s Next

The first release of 7,800 tons of treated water is expected to last about 17 days. Both Tepco and Japan’s fisheries agency have said they will monitor the ocean water for radioactive levels, and the IAEA has said it will also oversee the process, which is expected to last decades.

To compensate fishermen who lose business due to public anxiety, the Japanese government is allocating 80 billion yen ($552 million).

Komaru is mourning his separation from his wife, Kyoko (Shoshana Wilder), who spent hours watching televised news coverage of the disaster before walking out on him. We learn through flashbacks that the two got together under peculiar circumstances. Katagari, meanwhile, has an absurd meeting with an anthropomorphic frog named Frog (voiced by Földes), who tasks him with saving the city from a second impending earthquake caused by a giant earthworm.

Despite its original, unusual premise, “Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman” can’t shake the sense that it is multiple short stories stitched together, and the elusive nature of Murakami’s dialogue and characterizations does it no favors. It works well as a visual companion for fans of the author’s work, and as a flawed enigma for everyone else.

tsunami,The Composer of Noise,2021-04-12,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/12/t-magazine/long-distance-friends.html,"Japan, Korea, Tsunami, New Orleans, Berlin, Kreuzberg","WHILE READING “GHOSTS of the Tsunami,” I searched online for footage of the disaster, expecting it to sound like the hurricanes I’d watched on CNN, with howling winds and lashing water, or the oceanic roar of pounding waves. But it wasn’t what I expected at all. It was a malevolent thing, a black, flat, fast-moving amoebal mass, efficiently swallowing acres of gray paddy fields, office buildings, tile-roofed homes and highways full of cars. But what I heard was even eerier because the tsunami sounded so animal-like, like it was digesting all of human civilization, with its peristaltic, grinding crunch of steel and concrete and whole forests being ripped from their roots.

Thinking back, it was that sound, rather than the book, that first reminded me of Rei after all these years. It recalled for me his music, which I first encountered at the residency. We’d gathered at a library that was once a stone chapel and sat on foldout chairs. He turned off the lights and began his composition. A wind rose to a high jet whine that amplified to an annihilating engine roar. With no visuals or lyrics to help guide me, my imagination ran through a gauntlet of disasters. An artist from New Orleans cried afterward, saying she’d pictured a hurricane. Later, Rei told me he wanted to create a shelter of sound with his compositions. But at the time, I felt the opposite, as if his music had simulated a great suctioning cavity where there was once shelter, as if the chapel had been ripped from its foundations and we were exposed to the fury of a godless earth for the wounds we inflicted upon it.

IN THE MIDST of writing this piece, I reconnected with Rei over Zoom to ask about his parents. He lives in Berlin with two kids and his partner. He told me that his parents were doing fine, although some still believe that the poisons that had seeped into the earth might resurface later in the genes of plants, or animals, or children. When I told him that I was writing an essay about him, he was amused but also puzzled. But what could I possibly say?

The last time I saw Rei was in 2010, when my husband and I spent the summer in Berlin, a city that, with its graffiti and D.I.Y. gardens, still looked as though it had been rebuilt by artists. Rei and I hung out quite often that summer, meeting up for drinks at beer gardens or dinner along the green canal in Kreuzberg. I felt so weightless then.

Climate is very politicized. In a lot of red states, climate change can be a tricky subject. But a lot of red-state voters still care about clean water and air. Also, I sometimes struggle to get readers to my stories; if we say something like, “Our average temperatures will rise by this much in 100 years,” it’s hard to wrap your head around that. But pollution — such as chemicals turning up in our drinking water — feels much more immediate.

What are your greatest reporting challenges?

I do find the climate and environmental beat to be very challenging. You have to dig through a lot of science. I don’t want to say that business reporting was easier, but if retail sales were down, I could write a story about how analysts thought bad weather was a factor. Nobody can necessarily prove them right or wrong. But with climate science you have to be careful, or you can get things completely wrong.

There’s also a lot of policy, which is very dense. I struggle to wrap my mind around that. You have to be accurate, find the issues and write about them in a compelling way. Getting those elements into one story can be very challenging.

What’s the best part of your job?

My favorite moments as a journalist are when I’m talking to people, like a family in the Navajo Nation or a cattle farmer in Texas. I feel very thrilled when I meet someone I would have never crossed paths with if I weren’t a journalist.

You write about a lot of heavy subjects. How do you decompress?

I’m terrible at that. It helps that my husband is not a journalist. If I come home and say, “Oh my God, this terrible thing happened,” he will say, “That sounds really bad, but what should we have for dinner?” He’s only interested up until a certain point, which is nice. It reminds me that there are other important things in life.

This is dangerous, particularly in Asia, where more than 140 nuclear power reactors are already in operation and, led by growth in China and India, dozens more are either being built, are in the planning stages or have been proposed. If Japan, a globally respected cultural and economic force, can get away with dumping radioactive water, what’s to stop other countries?

There’s no denying that Japan and Tepco are in a bind over what to do with the byproducts of the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. Melted nuclear fuel debris inside the damaged reactors is being cooled by pumped-in water, which comes into contact with a toxic cocktail of radioactive substances known as radionuclides. To this is added approximately 100 tons of groundwater and rainwater, which leak into the reactor buildings each day and also become contaminated. All of the water is sent through a powerful filtration system to remove much of the radioactivity and is stored on-site in more than 1,000 giant steel tanks. But the amount of water is constantly growing, and Tepco has repeatedly warned that it is running out of storage space at Fukushima.

I have researched or written about Fukushima and affected communities ever since the disaster and have closely followed the official response. As early as 2013, the I.A.E.A. began advising Tepco to consider discharging the water into the sea. The government also looked at other options, such as releasing the water into the air as vapor or injecting it deep underground. But numerous experts and environmental groups have complained that there has been a consistent lack of sufficient public input and that some viable alternatives, such as long-term storage in more robust tanks, were not seriously evaluated. Despite opposition from many Japanese citizens, the country’s fisheries association, and neighbors like South Korea and China, the government announced in April 2021 that it had decided on releasing the water into the ocean.

Public hearings, some of which I attended, were held before and after the final decision, but these seemed more about selling the ocean release option than about giving the public a say. It was only months after the decision was announced that a radiological environmental impact assessment — conducted by Tepco — was finally released. When Tepco called for public comments for the study, some experts pointed out troubling information gaps, such as the lack of a full inventory of what radioactive elements remained in the tanks. There is no evidence that serious efforts were made to address some of these issues.

Involving local residents, civil society groups, technical experts and — when necessary — neighboring nations in decision-making can lead to notable successes. In choosing the site of a long-term repository for low-level radioactive waste, Belgian regulators in 1998 gave decision-making power to a broad cross section of public and private stakeholders. In the end, two neighboring towns actually competed to be the site, and in 2006 a proposal by the municipality of Dessel was approved. After years of study and environmental approvals, a final permit was issued this year. Similar processes have been followed in Finland and Sweden.",japan tepco bind byproducts worlds worst nuclear accident since chernobyl 1986 melted nuclear fuel debris inside damaged reactors cooled pumped,Japan,,7203.T,2229.63427734375,2286.404296875,2280.727294921875,2324.250732421875,2.5461583591584507,-0.24829388052166382,2.2915425232426054,4.243586315458213

Kazu, a migrant worker from Fukushima, where the 2011 earthquake and tsunami triggered a nuclear meltdown and subsequent mass evacuations, sprang from a series of 600 conversations that Yu conducted for a local radio program after the disaster.

Laura Perciasepe, a senior editor at Riverhead, said she appreciated how Yu wove together social criticism with a harrowing individual portrait. “The book is an indictment of capitalism, and an elegy to those it leaves behind,” Perciasepe wrote in an email. “But the novel is also quite personal and intimate, about a family and this man.”

Yu’s own connection to Fukushima, where she moved in 2015, runs deep. Her mother, a refugee from the Korean War who fled to Japan from South Korea in a small boat, landed in a village in Fukushima that was eventually flooded by a dam that served as a source of hydropower for Tokyo.

Morgan Giles, who translated “Tokyo Ueno Station” into English, said she was initially drawn to the novel because she had been reading other works about the Fukushima disaster. But Yu’s story, she said, “resonated much more globally. So many people are living in regions stripped of their resources and people and forgotten for that sacrifice.”

Yu is the eldest of four children. Her father, also the son of Korean immigrants, worked at a pachinko gambling parlor and was often abusive, she said, spending most of his income betting on horses or playing poker. Her mother supported the family as a hostess at a cabaret club in Yokohama, Japan’s second-largest city.

Storage space was rapidly running out, the authorities explained, and they were considering several solutions. Among them was removing the most harmful radioactive material from the water and then gradually releasing it into the ocean. The diplomats raised no objections, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said.

On Tuesday, when Japan officially announced that it would put the plan into action, the knives came out. South Korea denounced it as “utterly intolerable” and summoned the Japanese ambassador. China cited “grave concerns.” Taiwan also raised strong objections.

Japan has dismissed criticism of its plan as unscientific, saying that the treated water is well within safety standards, and pointing out that such releases into oceans are routine around the world.

Despite the determination by the international agency that it was safe to release the water, opponents at home and in neighboring countries have questioned both the government and the agency’s motives. When Japan’s cabinet approved the treated-water plan in 2021, it described the controlled ocean release as the best available disposal option.

Japan now plans to build as many as 22 new coal-burning power plants — one of the dirtiest sources of electricity — at 17 different sites in the next five years, just at a time when the world needs to slash carbon dioxide emissions to fight global warming.

“Why coal, why now?” said Ms. Kanno, a homemaker in Yokosuka, the site for two of the coal-burning units that will be built just several hundred feet from her home. “It’s the worst possible thing they could build.”

Repairs may ultimately cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, with daily costs for the ship tasked with fixing the cable, the CS Reliance, at between $35,000 and $50,000.

“It’s a must,” said Lee Cavanaugh, a partner at Cullman & Kravis Associates, a New York-based interior design firm. “I’ve seen people, to my horror, who don’t have a table near a seating arrangement — a decorator’s worst nightmare — and they have to put everything on the floor.”

When you’re selecting a coffee table, she advised, choose the materials carefully. Be aware that wood will weather over time if it’s left unsealed and that urban grit has a tendency to work its way into porous surfaces. Some metal finishes, on the other hand, may be problematic in the salty air near the ocean.

Another piece of advice: Don’t make the mistake of trying to match your table to your chairs.

In a speech at the Reagan Library in California on Thursday evening, brimming with callbacks to decades-old Republican catchphrases like George H.W. Bush’s “thousand points of light,” Mr. Suarez declared his candidacy with a reference to one more — and to his own catchphrase from a Twitter post he made in 2021 in response to a venture capitalist who suggested moving Silicon Valley to Miami.

“I believe America is still a shining city on a hill whose eyes of the world are upon us and whose promise needs to be restored,” he said, a day after filing paperwork for his run. “And I believe the city needs more than a shouter or a fighter. I believe it needs a servant. It needs a mayor. My name is Francis Suarez, and I am here to help.”

These houses are made from everything: cardboard boxes, scrap wood, vinyl sheets, discarded books, old telephone booths, reed screens. They’re furnished with art and some are equipped with electrical appliances powered by solar generators.

While some of these dwellings may violate local laws, Japan’s powerful constitution, which guarantees human rights and minimum standards of living, protects them and their builders. Through these houses, Sakaguchi saw a different way of thinking about architecture, and embarked on a full-fledged study.

Sakaguchi published a guide and an appreciation in the form of a photographic essay book, “Zero Yen House,” in 2004 showcasing the varied designs, and later held exhibitions and talks in Philadelphia, Berkeley, Calif., Nairobi, Kenya, as well as in Vancouver and Banff, Canada. The range of styles is remarkable: a mobile cardboard home built on a wooden cart, a house made out of a discarded playground slide, and even a house that incorporates a Shinto shrine. He went on to make videos on how to build your own mobile house.

“Sakaguchi’s work is part of a larger movement of artists responding to precarious and unsustainable aspects of Japanese society, as experienced in the cycles of boom, bust, and natural disasters over the past few decades,” said Jennifer Pastore, an editor for the art news site Tokyo Art Beat. The architect Shigeru Ban, for example, is well known for his temporary shelter and disaster housing. After Fukushima, Sakaguchi refurbished a crumbling house in Kumamoto as refugee housing and called it the “Zero Center.” At one point, 30-40 families displaced from Fukushima were living there.

“These houses are built on a shoestring budget by diverting and recycling the rubbish thrown away on the street,” Sakaguchi wrote for a 2006 exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery. “In this respect, these houses are built out of the resourcefulness of human nature, not by purchasing power.”",sakaguchi started pay attention people living streets tokyo building houses houses made everything cardboard boxes scrap wood vinyl sheets discarded books old telephone booths,Japan,,7203.T,1394.79345703125,1403.068603515625,1401.6600341796875,1441.802978515625,0.5932883067854539,-0.10039205013982153,0.4923006423512105,3.370357184240919

The radiation she got from her visit — about two chest X-rays’ worth — was worth the education she received on the tour, she told her 8.6 million Instagram followers. She then spoke admiringly of France, which, she said, “recycles their waste, increasing the efficiency of their system and reducing the overall amount of radioactive waste to deal with.”

Progressive lawmakers, along with environmental groups like the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council, have historically been against nuclear power — often focusing on the danger, longevity and storage requirements of the radioactive waste. During the 2020 presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said, “It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me to add more dangerous waste to this country and to the world when we don’t know how to get rid of what we have right now.” Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts echoed these concerns and pledged not to build any new nuclear plants if elected president.

So it’s no surprise that many Americans believe nuclear waste poses an enormous and terrifying threat. But after talking to engineers, radiation specialists and waste managers, I’ve come to see this misunderstanding is holding us back from embracing a powerful, clean energy source we need to tackle climate change. We must stop seeing nuclear waste as a dangerous problem and instead recognize it as a safe byproduct of carbon-free power.

Why is nuclear so important for reducing carbon emissions? The countries that have cleaned up their electricity production the fastest have generally done so with hydroelectric power, nuclear, or a combination of the two. The distinct advantage of nuclear is that it requires little land and can reliably produce lots of power regardless of weather, time of day or season. Unlike wind and solar, it can substitute directly for fossil fuels without backup or storage.

Since donors don’t want to support unhealthful habits like smoking, there is no account for cigarettes. And since the accounts are segregated from one another, there is no way to economize on food to get extra clothing or vice versa. The supermarkets also don’t always stock the brands or products that Syrian customers want. But the refugees are huge buyers of powdered milk imported from New Zealand because bulk commodities turn out to be the answer to their problems: “Families buy a large bag of powdered milk for 9 dinars on their e-card and sell it immediately to a smuggler for 7 dinars in cash,” Davies explains. “The smuggler then slips out of the camp … and resells the milk for 8 dinars to Jordanians driving past, who are happy to buy at this price.”

Once in possession of actual cash, the refugees can participate in a thriving economy of small shops and service providers in the camp. Davies contrasts the vibrancy and sense of purpose that hard-working residents of Zaatari enjoy with the drab, sterile existence of the ostensibly better planned Azraq camp nearby, thus offering a tidy example of classic arguments about the merits of decentralized voluntary exchange versus top-down planning.

Another such lesson comes from the Darien Gap region straddling Panama and Colombia, where the Panamanian government, in a well-intentioned effort to halt deforestation, launched a subsidy program to encourage landowners to plant trees. “But the policy was badly designed,” Davies writes, “rewarding any tree planting rather than specifying that native species must be replaced.”

The result is that rather than reviving cleared rain forest land with new rain forest, Panama is growing massive teak plantations. Real rain forests have multiple layers of canopy, with light filtering down to support a vast ecosystem. “By contrast, a teak tree’s massive leaves shade the forest floor completely, and when they fall and start to decompose they release an acid that kills insects. Stop at a teak plantation and you find that under the canopy there is nothing, and it is deathly quiet. Drained of water, starved of light and scorched by leaf acid, the soil is parched. The ground looks as if it has been doused with petrol and left to burn.”",syrian refugees huge buyers powdered milk imported new zealand davies contrasts vibrancy sense purpose hardworking residents zatari enjoy,New Zealand,,FPH.NZ,19.88797950744629,20.32518196105957,20.66935920715332,21.050748825073242,2.1983251413226146,1.6933538245962534,3.9289043887765156,5.8465935023293785

When China dropped its “zero Covid” policy, many feared a prolonged, crushing tide of infections rippling from cities to rural areas. Just two months later, China appears to have moved past the worst of its Covid wave — for now.

One possible reason: Covid appears to have jumped from cities to the countryside faster than expected. Some health officials think as many as 80 percent of China’s 1.4 billion people were infected in late 2022, though some are skeptical of that estimate. The worst may be already over.

Now, the Communist Party has turned its attention to reviving the economy. Many ordinary Chinese seem eager to move on from the pandemic and focus on making a living again. Doctors who were mobilized across China to treat a rush of Covid patients said in phone interviews that the number of patients they were now seeing had fallen.

But China is still vulnerable to fresh outbreaks, especially as immunity wanes. The Lunar New Year is ending, and normal life is resuming. That could send the virus to places that managed to avoid the recent surge.",covid appears jumped cities countryside faster expected health officials think many 80 percent chinas 14 billion people infected late 202 worst may already,China,,0700.HK,381.1725769042969,376.2503967285156,379.0068054199219,376.2503967285156,-1.2913258912162218,0.7325995441793896,-0.5681865946297527,-1.2913258912162218

The program includes concert performances of Bartok’s “Bluebeard’s Castle” and excerpts from various operas, including Wagner’s “Der Fliegende Holländer” and Debussy’s “Pelléas et Mélisande,” as well as Jessie Montgomery’s “Hymn for Everyone.”

Last year Nézet-Séguin, who became the Met’s music director in 2018, led a company tour, the first since 2002, in Europe. (A 2021 tour there had also been canceled by the pandemic.) “Bringing live music and performances to audiences around the world is my passion,” he said in a statement.

Orchestra tours can be costly, and the Met’s finances have been strained recently: In January, the company said that it had withdrawn nearly $40 million in additional emergency funds from its endowment as it worked to recover from the pandemic closures, one of the most trying periods in its 141-year history. In the previous season, the Met took $30 million from its endowment fund.

But Gelb said the visit to Asia would generate a modest amount of revenue for the Met. The company has lined up several sponsors for the tour, including Rolex, Bank of America and So-Chung Shinn Lee, a longtime Met donor, and her husband, Tony W. Lee, an investor.

One of those aftershocks, which struck about nine hours after the initial quake, was nearly as strong as the first and measured at magnitude 7.5. Powerful aftershocks like that can add to the destruction, shaking buildings and infrastructure that have already been badly weakened by the initial quake.

The 7.5 aftershock was well above average, and was about one-third as powerful as the 7.8 quake. From statistical analyses of quakes worldwide, the most powerful aftershock Monday would have been expected to be about magnitude 6.8, or only about one-thirtieth as powerful as the first quake.

“There’s nothing magic about aftershock magnitude,” said Susan Hough, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey. Sometimes an aftershock is even larger than the initial quake, Dr. Hough said, in which case the aftershock is considered the main quake and the first one is referred to as a foreshock.

Aftershocks can occur on the same fault as the main earthquake, or on nearby faults that are affected by the stress changes. This aftershock was centered about 60 miles north of the initial quake.

Aftershocks also can continue to occur for weeks or months following a strong quake, with their frequency and strength gradually declining.

The earthquakes on Monday occurred on the East Anatolian Fault Zone, part of a complex system of faults in Turkey that make the region one of the most seismically active in the world. Another fault zone, the North Anatolian, has caused many large earthquakes, including a 1999 quake centered about 60 miles from Istanbul that killed more than 15,000 people.

All of these are strike-slip faults, meaning the blocks of crust move horizontally relative to one another when strains between them reach a breaking point. Dr. Hough said that given the magnitude of the first quake on Monday, it’s likely that the movement occurred along 120 miles or so of the fault.

After the initial break, near Gaziantep in south central Turkey, the rupture would have propagated along the fault at about 2 miles a second, Dr. Hough said. This would help account for the lengthy shaking, which some witnesses said lasted for 90 seconds or longer.

Large strike-slip fault zones on land are not common , Dr. Hough said; the San Andreas Fault in California is another example. But those on land can be extremely destructive, because they tend to be close to population centers, and they can be fairly shallow, increasing the shaking felt at the surface.

Some quakes are centered more than a hundred miles below the surface, but the initial shock on Monday occurred at a depth of about 11 miles.

In some cases the destruction from strike-slip earthquakes is more widespread than from larger quakes that occur in so-called subduction zones, where one large crustal plate is sliding beneath another. Subduction zones, like those that exist around the rim of the Pacific Ocean, are usually offshore and tremors occur at greater depth. Most of the destruction in those cases often comes from a tsunami, as occurred in the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan.",75 aftershock well average onethird powerful 78 quake powerful aftershocks like add destruction shaking buildings infrastructure,California,,PCG,15.473007202148438,15.582462310791016,15.562561988830566,15.502859115600586,0.7073938970789092,-0.1277097390870507,0.5787807470915813,0.19292897018753716

Now, as the organizers press ahead with plans to hold the Tokyo Olympics this summer, the event itself threatens to become a trial from which Japan may take years to recover.

A series of health, economic and political challenges have besieged the Games. Even as the organizers decided last week to bar international spectators, epidemiologists warn that the Olympics could become a superspreader event. Thousands of athletes and other participants will descend on Tokyo from more than 200 countries while much of the Japanese public remains unvaccinated.

The financial hazards are also significant — the Olympic budget has swollen to a record $15.4 billion, increasing nearly $3 billion in the past year alone and adding to longstanding doubts about whether Olympic Games pay off for host nations.

As Valentin holds his hands just above Laurie’s body, the soundtrack is filled with eruptive moans and sighs, woven through the percussive, chiming musical score. When the ladies reunite, Laurie jokes, “I haven’t been not-touched by a man like that in a long time.”

That’s when Kate makes a surprising confession: She finds all this new age healing stuff “goofy,” “spooky” and “kind of witchy.” When Jaclyn suggests that eastern spiritual practices are superior to Christianity because they are more empowering to women, Kate defends the church she has been attending since moving to Texas. This leads to several probing questions. Is this, like, a “real Texan church, with bible-thumpers?” (Kate, noncommittal: “They’re nice people, really good families.”) Does talking politics ever get awkward? (“Why would it?”) Is Kate a conservative now? (“I’m an independent.”) Did Kate vote for Trump? (Long pause, and then, “Are we really gonna talk about Trump tonight?”)

In one of those sharp, funny, “Mike White Touch” moments, Laurie and Jaclyn try to defuse the mounting tension by lying, saying, “Can’t wait to get down there,” and “I really want to come.” Then later, as the day ends, after Kate retreats to her bedroom she can see — and almost hear — the other two talking about her.

This is all part of his plan to get close to Sritala’s husband, Jim, who Rick already knows is convalescing in Bangkok — and who, I assume, may be responsible in some way for the murder of Rick’s father. Rick mentions his dad again in another of his stress-management sessions, during which Dr. Amrita suggests that the root cause of his stress is anger, and that, “Underneath anger there is always a sadness, something we are grieving.” Rick then brings up the murder, adding ominously, “I can’t get my life back, but maybe I can still get some satisfaction.”",kate finds new age healing stuff goofy spooky kind witchy rick makes move sritala posing showbiz powerplayer,Texas,,CNP,34.380001068115234,34.56999969482422,33.689998626708984,34.529998779296875,0.5526428761085561,-2.5455628460621225,-2.006987841679195,0.4362935035530054

Freezes Pandemic-Era Tax Credit Amid Fraud Fears,2023-09-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/us/politics/irs-pandemic-employee-credit-fraud.html,"Washington, I.R.S.","The I.R.S. is slowing the pace of refunds from applications that have already been submitted and urging taxpayers to consider withdrawing their applications if they believe that they might be ineligible. The program will remain frozen until at least the end of the year.

“We are deeply concerned that this program is not operating in the way it was intended,” Daniel Werfel, the I.R.S. commissioner, said on Thursday. “We believe you should see only a trickle of employee retention claims coming in. Instead, we are seeing a tsunami.”

At the onset of the pandemic in 2020, as large swaths of the economy went into lockdown, Washington set up various programs to help keep businesses and their workers afloat. Among them was the Employee Retention Credit, a tax benefit that was created as part of the initial $2 trillion pandemic relief legislation. The program offered businesses thousands of dollars per employee if they could show that Covid-19 was hurting their bottom lines and that they were continuing to pay workers.

In 2021, after Congress expanded eligibility, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the credit would cost the federal government about $85 billion over a decade — up from an earlier estimate of $55 billion. The I.R.S. said on Thursday that it had already paid out about $230 billion in refunds associated with the tax credit and had a backlog of 600,000 claims.

Mr. Werfel said 15 percent of the 3.6 million claims for the credit that the I.R.S. had received since the program began were submitted in the past 90 days. The fact that the pace of applications has been picking up raised concerns within the I.R.S. that their previous warnings about the abuse of the program had gone unheeded.",irs slowing pace refunds applications already submitted program remain frozen least end year congressional budget office projected credit would cost federal,Washington,,WY,30.81005859375,31.337135314941406,31.193382263183594,29.976314544677734,1.7107293697205979,-0.4587306730914606,1.2441510562766445,-2.7060774536838936

The film speaks the same cinematic language, employing an ethereal, emotive color palette that enlivens every splash of water and blade of grass.

You can spot Miyazaki’s influence in more than just the visuals. There are familiar symbols and themes: The portal doors, the cursed male hero and a few narrative moves in the resolution all scream Miyazaki’s “Howl’s Moving Castle,” while the exploration of memory and grief mirrors his “Spirited Away.”

I’ll stop the Miyazaki comparisons there because Shinkai showcases plenty of his own narrative and directorial signatures in “Suzume.” He’s created a thoroughly modern world of both old and new forms of magic, of spells and old gods and of Instagram posts and texts. Like a locomotive chugging uphill, the story’s stakes are quickly raised to the scale of natural disasters and mythical phenomena, while Shinkai puts an emphasis on specific towns and regions in Japan, grounding us in the real world even as he whisks us away to other worlds.

What’s particularly exciting in “Suzume” is the story’s start. Seventeen-year-old Suzume wakes up from an otherworldly dream and heads off to school. On the way, she encounters and tries to follow a mysterious stranger named Souta but ends up in the ruins of an old resort, where she stumbles upon a free-standing door floating in a shallow bank of water. She opens it, and soon flaring wind, flying debris and massive red tendrils reach out and consume the darkening skies of Japan. This is only 10 minutes in.

One is Joan Washington, whom we get to know as passionate and commanding, a great teacher, a wonderful mother, a smartass and a woman who understood and loved her husband, deeply. I would have been happy to go on reading about their life and their marriage, and even their shared adoration of their “longed-for, miracle, baby,” Olivia, who seems to be an impressive woman, very supportive of them both, during the fears and misery of Washington’s Stage 4 lung cancer diagnosis and the “tsunami of grief” that Grant describes. I was not happy to read the details of Joan’s diagnosis and dying, but those sections of the book are genuine and compelling.

The woman in the book whom I could easily do without is … Barbra Streisand. Barbra Streisand comes off well: shy, thoughtful, wildly gifted and a genuine mensch. To be clear, I make no complaints about her, and neither Grant nor I criticize anything she does in this book. It is not her fault that Richard E. Grant has adored her since he wrote her a fan letter when he was 14. Not her fault that he commissioned a “two-foot-tall sculpture of Streisand’s face” for his garden. Not her fault that there are far too many pages about his adoration, his ruses to meet her and those meetings, in which — let me say again — she was the soul of grace.

I could have done without all of that, because, like Richard E. Grant, I just wanted more of the feisty, unvarnished, irritable, generous, wise, unimpressed Joan Washington. You cannot read this book and not miss her very much.

Surveys that track audience interest suggested that “The Way of Water” could arrive to as much as $175 million in opening-weekend ticket sales in the United States and Canada.

It was not to be.

The ultraexpensive event movie collected about $134 million at North American theaters over its first three days, according to Comscore, which compiles ticketing data. Directed by James Cameron and revisiting the fantasy world of Pandora, “The Way of Water” cost Disney an estimated $600 million to make and market. Three more sequels are planned.

But there may still be a way for “The Way of Water” to become a big, blue juggernaut — possibly even surpassing the $2 billion in global sales that Cameron publicly set as the benchmark for financial success, given the film’s stratospheric production and marketing costs. Consider what happened with the first “Avatar” in 2009. It arrived to a soft $77 million and went on to gross $2.9 billion worldwide.

“It’s not the kind of movie that you can analyze by looking at how the first weekend did,” said Richard L. Gelfond, the chief executive of IMAX Corporation. “It’s all about how it holds on.

Jean Carroll trial, the #MeToo movement comes full circle.

Trump’s election in 2016, after he’d been heard boasting of sexual assault on the “Access Hollywood” tape and accused of sexual assault by more than a dozen women, set off a tsunami of female fury. That fury powered the Women’s March. It inspired countless women — some of them previously apolitical suburbanites — to put their lives on hold and throw themselves into activism or to run for office themselves. And that fury, that intolerable sense of incredulous disgust and civic violation, was the spark that set off the #MeToo movement, as women, unable to do anything about the abuser running the country, turned their energy toward those in their own institutions, including the entertainment industry. I’ve long been convinced that Trump was the reason revelations about Harvey Weinstein led to a nationwide paroxysm.

The #MeToo movement is why E. Jean Carroll wrote the memoir in which she revealed that Trump violated her in a Bergdorf Goodman changing room in the mid-1990s. “As the riotous, sickening stories of #MeToo surged across the country, I, like many women, could not help but be reminded of certain men in my own life,” she wrote. The movement is the reason that in 2022, New York passed the Adult Survivors Act, which created a window during which sexual assault survivors could sue their attackers even beyond the statute of limitations. (The movement is also the reason the bill was signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul, not a disgraced Andrew Cuomo.)

Carroll’s lawsuit was one of the first filed under the Adult Survivors Act. And because of her perseverance, Trump will, for the first time, face legal accountability for his treatment of women.

The announcement came after the countries reached an agreement to expand monitoring of the treated water, which Japan began discharging in August of last year. The Japanese government and Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operated the Fukushima plant and is overseeing its cleanup, have assured the public that the water is safe for human consumption.

China was the most outspoken of several Asia-Pacific countries that objected to the release of the water, citing fears that it could contaminate seafood, though most scientists have dismissed such concerns. The water had been used to cool the nuclear fuel rods destroyed in 2011 when the Fukushima plant, on Japan’s east coast, melted down after a devastating earthquake and tsunami.

The measure had met with resistance from opposition parties in recent months, and led to widespread anger and huge demonstrations in cities around Spain, with opponents denouncing it as a ploy by Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez to remain in power.

The stress of living at perpetual high alert in a world that has seemed, for the past several years, to be in an ever-shifting state of emergency. Amid all that, in the post-shutdown theater, has come a tsunami of shows dedicated to elucidating social ills and processing cultural pain. Such work is vital now and always; don’t get me wrong.

But we desperately require its counterweight, too — shows that usher us into alternate worlds where we can give ourselves over to pure delight. The Classical Theater of Harlem gets that, deeply, and proves it with a delectable “Twelfth Night” so fizzy and fun that you may be surprised afterward at how relaxed your body is, and how much lighter your spirit feels.

Or are you annoyed when a cashier hands one back to you with your change? When was the last time you used or even looked at one?

How would you feel if the United States stopped using pennies?

Caity Weaver argues in “Abolish the Penny?” that America must free itself from the tyranny of the copper-colored coin:

I have good news and I have bad news. Actually, I have crazy news and I have bad news. Actually, all the news I have is bad, but some of it is also crazy. Before you become totally freaked out, all the news I’m describing here is about pennies; it’s nothing life and death. But you do need to buckle up.

If you are reading this and live in America, or used to live in America, or maybe just went to America one time many years ago, then you are almost certainly performing unpaid labor for the U.S. government and have been for years. How? By storing some of the billions of pennies the U.S. Mint makes every year that virtually no one uses.

Why are we still making tons (many thousands of tons) of pennies if no one uses them? That’s a sensible question with a psychotic answer: We have to keep making all these pennies — over $45 million worth last year — because no one uses them. In fact, it could be very bad if we did.

When you insert a quarter into a soda machine, that quarter eventually finds its way back to a bank, from which it can be redistributed to a store’s cash register and handed out as change — maybe even to you, who can put it into a soda machine again and start the whole process over. That’s beautiful. (Please be mindful of your soft drink consumption.)

But few of us ever spend pennies. We mostly just store them. The 1-cent coins are wherever you’ve left them: a glass jar, a winter purse, a RAV4 cup holder, a five-gallon water cooler dispenser, the couch. Many of them are simply on the ground. But take it from me, a former cashier: Cashiers don’t have time to scrounge on the sidewalk every time they need to make change. That is where the Mint comes in. Every year it makes a few billion more pennies to replace the ones everyone is thoughtlessly, indefinitely storing and scatters them like kudzu seeds across the nation.

You — a scientist of some kind, possibly — might think an obvious solution now presents itself: Why not encourage people to use the pennies they have lying around instead of manufacturing new ones every year? We can’t! Or, anyway, we’d better not. According to a Mint report, if even a modest share of our neglected pennies suddenly returned to circulation, the result would be a “logistically unmanageable” dilemma for Earth’s wealthiest nation. As in, the penny tsunami could overwhelm government vaults.

That’s not great, but at the end of the day we’re talking only about pennies. How much could a penny cost to make? A penny? If only we lived in such a paradise. Unfortunately, one penny costs more than three pennies (3.07 cents at last count) to make and distribute!

When I learned this, I lost my mind. Whose fault is this? And who can make it stop? I spent months pleading for answers from government officials, former Mint employees, numismatists, economists, scientists, scrap-metal industrialists, souvenir-elongated-penny machinists, historians, businesspeople, poverty researchers and even Canadians.

When hurricanes, blizzards or tsunamis strike they always reveal weaknesses — failure to plan, failure to invest in precautions.

The disaster in Texas, however, was different. The collapse of the Texas power grid didn’t just reveal a few shortcomings. It showed that the entire philosophy behind the state’s energy policy is wrong. And it also showed that the state is run by people who will resort to blatant lies rather than admit their mistakes.

Texas isn’t the only state with a largely deregulated electricity market. It has, however, pushed deregulation further than anyone else. There is an upper limit on wholesale electricity prices, but it’s stratospherically high. And there is essentially no prudential regulation — no requirements that utilities maintain reserve capacity or invest in things like insulation to limit the effects of extreme weather.

The theory was that no such regulation was necessary, because the magic of the market would take care of everything. After all, a surge in demand or a disruption of supply — both of which happened in the deep freeze — will lead to high prices, and hence to big profits for any power supplier that manages to keep operating.

Bush Calls for End to Pandemic Partisanship,2020-05-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/us/politics/george-w-bush-coronavirus-unity.html,"New York, Haiti, America, the United States","Mr. Trump has declined to call on his predecessors to help bring the country together during the pandemic, which has now claimed more than 66,000 lives in the United States and put more than 30 million people out of work. Past presidents made a point of enlisting former occupants of the White House from both parties in times of crisis to demonstrate national resolve and unity.

Mr. Bush recruited his father, former President George Bush, and Mr. Clinton to respond to a devastating tsunami in Asia and then to Hurricane Katrina. President Barack Obama asked the younger Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton to respond to an earthquake in Haiti.

Mr. Trump, for his part, has dismissed the idea of calling his predecessors for help, either to participate or even to offer advice. “I don’t think I’m going to learn much,” he said when asked about the idea in March. “I guess you could say that there’s probably a natural inclination not to call.”

Mr. Bush has never been a fan of his fellow Republican president. Mr. Trump defeated his brother, Jeb Bush, for the nomination in 2016 and has lambasted the 43rd president’s record repeatedly. Mr. Bush refused to support Mr. Trump that fall, saying he had voted for “none of the above” instead. While disturbed by Mr. Trump’s leadership, Mr. Bush has largely kept quiet since then with a couple of notable exceptions, such as a speech in New York and a eulogy for Senator John McCain that were seen as implicit rebukes of the incumbent.

In his video message on Saturday, Mr. Bush recalled the difficult days after Sept. 11. “Let us remember, we have faced times of testing before,” he said as images flashed on the screen of him comforting relatives of those killed in the attacks. “Following 9/11, I saw a great nation rise as one to honor the brave, to grieve with the grieving and to embrace unavoidable new duties. And I have no doubt, none at all, that this spirit of service and sacrifice is alive and well in America.”",mr bush recruited father former president george bush mr clinton respond devastating tsunami asia hurricane katrina mr trump dismissed idea calling predecessors help either participate,New York,,TRV,86.14766693115234,86.91901397705078,86.91901397705078,85.66333770751953,0.8953777547044706,0.0,0.8953777547044706,-0.5622081721840241

But the final four men are all stars or superstars and all ranked in the top eight. Berrettini and Stefanos Tsitsipas have both reached Grand Slam finals. Daniil Medvedev won the U.S. Open last year, and Rafael Nadal is one of the greatest players in the sport’s long history and equal with Djokovic at 20 Grand Slam singles titles. So I think the men’s tournament has retained its legitimacy and interest, even if no one can ever say it was a full-strength event with Djokovic missing.

I’m curious what you make of how the Peng Shuai case has been handled by the tennis world. Do you think Australia’s response fit with the general consensus or diverged?

Like too many things in tennis, the response has been far from unified. Power and governance is fragmented in the sport, with the WTA, ATP, International Tennis Federation and each of the four Grand Slam tournaments making their own moves and decisions. Though all those entities have expressed concern for Peng’s safety, the only one to commit to action is the WTA, the women’s tour, which has suspended its tournaments in China and called for a full Chinese investigation into Peng’s allegations of sexual assault and for an open line of communication with her.

Seen through that prism, Tennis Australia, which runs the Australian Open, is not an outlier. But it does have more at stake with China than the other Grand Slam tournaments. It has a major Chinese sponsor, which has its name on one of the show courts at the Australian Open. Tennis Australia also has offices in China and has promoted Chinese tourism to the tournament. It also wants TV coverage in China, because the time difference with Europe and North America is not ideal for those broadcast windows.

The Australian Open promotes itself as the Grand Slam of the Asia-Pacific, in part because it wants to block the emergence of any potential rivals for its Grand Slam status in the fast-growing region. But Tennis Australia, like the sport, is at something of a crossroads with China. Australia-Chinese relations have deteriorated.

Every Saturday afternoon, protesters collect outside Parliament House in Melbourne, then stream down through the city center toward the waterfront.

In November, when I moved to the city, those protesters were a tsunami of frustration and anger. They closed off streets and disrupted public transportation, the chants of thousands echoing off the glass-and-stone skyscrapers. These days, the protests are more of a trickle — a few hundred people most weeks, railing against scientific consensus, Covid-19 vaccines and restrictions, the media and the government, among other institutions.

Around a year ago, Australia and New Zealand imposed strict vaccine mandates that affected where unvaccinated people could eat, drink and shop; how they could gather to socialize and worship; and what jobs they could hold. These days, with the exception of some mask requirements and vaccine mandates for certain health and education workers, almost all of these restrictions have been lifted. Yet the protests continue.

In New Zealand this week, about 2,000 people gathered outside Parliament in Wellington. Though some were there to protest the Covid-19 restrictions still in place, others held signs against the “U.N. agenda,” the World Economic Forum and “socialist dictators,” as well as banners that called for an end to the government. In a mock trial featuring a fake judge, the New Zealand government was eventually found guilty by the protesters for “crimes against humanity.”",australia new zealand imposed strict vaccine mandates year ago days exception mask requirements restrictions lifted yet protests continue,Australia,,QBE.AX,10.913008689880371,11.129644393920898,11.00327205657959,11.057433128356934,1.9851143731005507,-1.1354570987940475,0.8271171522379519,1.323415407984484

Massive American-style pickup trucks are having a surge of popularity in Australia, to the annoyance of some drivers.

“The Americans are coming for our roads, hogging them up with their obnoxious, grand old trucks,” one news story announced. Another described it as a “tsunami of supersized American pickup-style trucks.” And some have cited reports of these vehicles seemingly getting stuck trying to make it around roundabouts, a rare feature on American roads but extremely common in Australia.

Although the popularity of American-style utes — utility vehicles, aka pickup trucks — is a relatively recent one, Australian vehicles have been steadily getting bigger for the past few decades. SUVs and light commercial vehicles — which includes utes — made up 77 percent of the new vehicles sold in Australia in 2022, according to the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. A decade ago, the two categories made up less than 50 percent of sales.

It’s become noticeable enough that Standards Australia, the nongovernmental body that sets the nation’s parking space size requirements, wants to increase the length of off-street parking spots by 20 centimeters, or just under eight inches, to “accommodate the trend of larger vehicles on Australian roads.”",australian drivers annoyed popularity large americanstyle pickup trucks suvs light commercial vehicles made 77 percent new vehicles sold 202 standards australia wants increase length ofstret parking spots,Australia,,QBE.AX,14.696207046508789,14.57536506652832,14.417341232299805,14.287203788757324,-0.8222664500986042,-1.0841843995483198,-1.8975359650722352,-2.783053181389596

You probably have. A couple of years ago, Walgreens said that organized shoplifting was behind its decision to close several locations in San Francisco. In April, the National Retail Federation issued a dire report claiming that “organized retail crime” was responsible for almost half of the store merchandise that vanished in 2021. The putative shoplifting tsunami has been relentlessly hyped both by the usual suspects, such as Fox News, and by some politicians.

But it never happened.

My guess is that most readers didn’t notice the retail federation’s recent retraction of its April claims. Probably even fewer people noticed when The San Francisco Chronicle examined police records and found that they didn’t support Walgreens’s assertions; “maybe we cried too much,” the company’s chief financial officer told investors earlier this year.

Data on shoplifting are flaky, depending a lot on retailers’ own reports. Was there really a surge in New York City, while shoplifting declined in the rest of the country? Maybe. What is clear is that the narrative of larcenous mobs sweeping through America’s stores wasn’t a depiction of reality; it was basically conjured out of some dubious data and a handful of videos.

It was about Dr. Seuss.

In early March 2021, a Morning Consult/Politico poll found that nearly half of Republicans said they had heard “a lot” about the news that the Seuss estate had decided to stop selling six books it deemed had offensive imagery. That was a bigger share than had heard a lot about the $1.9 trillion dollar stimulus package enacted into law that very week.

The result was a vivid marker of how much the Republican Party had changed over the Trump era. Just a dozen years earlier, a much smaller stimulus package sparked the Tea Party movement that helped propel Republicans to a landslide victory in the 2010 midterm election. But in 2021 the right was so consumed by the purported cancellation of Dr. Seuss that it could barely muster any outrage about big government spending.

March 2024 looks very different. While we, like other major economies, experienced a bout of inflation during the postpandemic recovery, most workers have experienced wage gains considerably larger than the price increase. And President Biden is currently presiding over a remarkable episode of “immaculate disinflation”: rapidly falling inflation with unemployment near a 50-year low.

But while even a focus on early 2020 doesn’t tell the story Republicans think it does, what we really should be discussing is what happened to America when the coronavirus arrived.

Once we knew that a deadly virus was on the loose — and we now know that several officials warned Trump about the threat in January 2020 — the appropriate policy response was clear: do whatever we could to slow the rate at which the virus was spreading.

Even though large numbers of Americans would inevitably suffer from Covid-19 at some point, “flattening the curve” had two huge advantages. First, it would help avoid the very real possibility that a tsunami of Covid infections would overwhelm our health care system. Second, it bought time for the development of effective vaccines: Since vaccines could greatly reduce mortality from Covid-19, deaths delayed by public health measures would, in many cases, be deaths avoided.

What kind of public action was needed? In the early stages of the pandemic, as scientists raced to figure out exactly how the virus spread, blunt measures were required: engaging in social distancing, blocking high-risk interactions as much as possible. These measures were costly: In April 2020, unemployment shot up to 14.8 percent. But America is a rich country that could and for the most part did mitigate the economic pain with financial aid to hard-hit workers and businesses. And once researchers and medical officials keyed in on the virus’s airborne character, it became possible to limit its spread by getting people to wear masks, which was annoying but by no means a severe hardship.",reagan delivered famous line america suffering nasty combination high unemployment high inflation march 2024 looks different like major economies experienced bout inflation postpandemic recovery,America,,TRV,215.57945251464844,214.64599609375,215.20608520507812,216.62100219726562,-0.43299879000991986,0.26093620264106737,-0.17319243796898617,0.48313958982079475

New Zealanders might have a “pav,” as the dish is known, at a family gathering, to mark some special occasion or just because someone has some egg whites to use up. At Christmas meals, it is all but compulsory — a final hurrah after slices of hot ham, or roasted potatoes with a leg of lamb.

As an emergency room doctor fighting this new surge, I am grateful that vaccines and a potentially less lethal variant have meant that fewer of my patients today need life support than they did at the start of the pandemic. In March 2020, nurses and doctors rushed between patients, endlessly trying to stabilize one before another crashed. Many of my patients needed supplemental oxygen, and the sickest needed to be put on ventilators. Many never came off them. Our intensive care units filled beyond capacity, and yet patients kept coming.

Thankfully, this wave is not like that. I haven’t needed to put any Covid-19 patients on a ventilator so far. And the majority of patients haven’t needed supplemental oxygen, either.

We also have good treatment tools: Cheap, widely available medications like steroids have proved to be lifesavers for Covid-19 patients. We now know that administering oxygen at high flow rates through the nose substantially improves patient outcomes. Although currently in very short supply, oral antivirals are highly effective at reducing Covid hospitalizations.

But much like that of the British royal family, the role of Japan’s imperial family is symbolic and separate from the country’s government.

The tour on Thursday is part of a weeklong visit to Britain by the emperor and his wife, Empress Masako. The couple have long had a personal connection to the country. Both studied at Oxford University in the 1980s — the emperor was crown prince at the time; the empress was part of a Japanese foreign ministry program that sends early-career diplomats abroad to study.

The links between Japan and Kew Gardens date to the early 20th century.

Since the early 20th century, the royal and imperial families of Britain and Japan have had a close relationship. In 1902, the two countries signed the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, an agreement that fostered cooperation and cultural exchange.

As British interest about its new ally grew, Japanese art exhibitions became popular; the 1910 Japan-British Exhibition in London drew more than eight million visitors, according to the Japanese Embassy here.

For my article about Canada, published on Thursday, I spoke with people in a variety of fields including vaccine development, epidemiology, infection control and medical supply chains. All of them said they understood Canadians’ frustration. But none of them were the least bit surprised that the first wave of vaccine deliveries didn’t happen as planned. That, they said, is the nature of new vaccines.

They also cited two factors in the slow start: the lack of an established vaccine maker headquartered in Canada and the country’s modest vaccine manufacturing capability. But they said there was little the government could have done to get such plants up and running by now.

Until last summer, Mr. Trudeau and other members of his cabinet repeatedly suggested that they were working to have vaccines coming out of Canadian factories by the end of 2020. But in testimony this week at Parliamentary committee, Mark Lievonen, the vice chairman of the federal vaccine task force, said that there was never a Canadian manufacturing option that could have sped up deliveries. And in earlier testimony, Anita Anand, the minister whose department made the vaccine deals, said that the government was unable last year to persuade any of the major vaccine makers to set up shop in Canada.

There will be domestically made vaccines, but that won’t happen until well after September, the government’s target for getting all Canadians vaccinated. Federally funded plants in Montreal and Saskatoon expect to be operating by the end of the year, which is also the projected delivery date for what would be Canada’s first homegrown vaccine. Its developer, Providence Therapeutics, a biotech start-up based in Calgary, is in early phases of testing the vaccine and has signed a deal to produce those end-of-year batches for Manitoba, assuming regulatory authorization.",last summer mr trudeau members cabinet repeatedly suggested working vaccines coming canadian factories end 2020 federally funded plants montreal saskatoon expect operating,Canada,,IFC.TO,132.04388427734375,130.22328186035156,129.90304565429688,130.3696746826172,-1.3787858687708785,-0.24591317426487638,-1.621308426939545,-1.2679190739421662

The report, which collected rent ledgers from the owners of 128 properties primarily in the South Bronx and northern Brooklyn, is one of the most detailed looks at a segment of renters rarely recorded by industry surveys. Most of the buildings were financed using Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, which typically require that rents be affordable to households making up to 60 percent of the area median income, or $64,440 for a family of three in 2021. The units do not often appear on listing websites, because they are offered through affordable housing lotteries with long wait lists.

This group of renters as a whole may actually be doing better than other tenants, in part because their rents are below market rate, said Katherine O’Regan, a faculty director at N.Y.U. Furman Center. The median market-rate rent in New York City was about $2,500 a month in April, according to the listing site StreetEasy.

But the sharp rise in debt for those who have fallen behind is alarming for both tenants, who could face imminent eviction, and landlords, who are unlikely to recoup a sizable share of rent, because it is owed by the city’s most overburdened renters, Ms. O’Regan said. More than half of the total debt in the portfolio was held by households that owed more than $10,000.

A state moratorium prohibiting evictions from proceeding is scheduled to end Aug. 31, and thousands of New Yorkers could soon be forced from their homes.

The Solomon Islands is small, remote and economically insignificant. But if all countries like us are dismissed as such, China will pick us off one by one with its promises of business projects and development aid.

For decades, we identified with the West, a legacy forged when the United States, Australia and their allies halted Japan’s imperial advance during World War II in the Battle of Guadalcanal. But that was long ago. There is a creeping sense today that we are being ignored, if not forgotten. So who can blame us if we open the door to new friends who can help with our needs?

And those needs are great.

Forty-four years after independence, we are still struggling to build a nation. Despite rich natural resources, around 80 percent of our 700,000 citizens still live in hard-to-reach rural areas, subsisting on family-run plots of lands. Many still lack access to running water, basic sanitation and electricity. Jobs are scarce, access to health care is limited, and high numbers of children are stunted by poor diets. Already prone to earthquakes, tsunamis and cyclones, we face ominous new threats because of climate change, including coral bleaching and rising sea levels that are slowly washing away islands.

We don’t blame anyone for these problems, but as Western leaders point fingers at China and chide our leader, we’d like to ask: Where have you been?

To be fair, Australia, New Zealand and the United States have provided much-needed assistance over the decades, and the U.S. Peace Corps arrived in 1971. But those volunteers were pulled out 22 years ago during a period of violent political unrest. U.S. aid to the Solomon Islands, already dwarfed by Australia’s, flatlined in the 2010s. My work as a journalist has taken me across these islands, and I’ve seen little remaining legacy of Peace Corps works, or U.S. help in general.

This critic feels as if he’s perpetually wandering, lately, through a mall bookstore called Dystopias R Us. The bookstore has locked its doors and will not let him out. Aiieeee!

Kalfar’s dystopia feels thirdhand. Happily, he has other things to work with. His heroine, Adela Slavikova, lives in a Czech village. On the novel’s first page, she learns she has not long, perhaps a year, to live. Her doctor, “a great poet of the macabre,” doesn’t give her the option of denial. He is determined to tell her exactly how awful it’s going to be: “crumbling bones, renal failure, death by brain bleed or fungal infection.”

Not long after, Adela is drunk on box wine in her bathroom, sliding off the toilet, as one does, when a carp she is keeping in the tub begins to speak to her. “Find your daughter, go, go now,” it says. “Idiot. Your destiny awaits in the New World.”

Adela gave a daughter up for adoption at birth, and she decides to go to America — the world according to carp — to find her. Kalfar’s inventiveness rolls as if on wheels. Adela flies on an ultra-budget airline where the seats have no cushions, each passenger is limited to one cup of water and you have to pay in cash to use the toilet. In New York, at MoMA, she sees a life-size hologram of Vincent van Gogh pop up and chastise a boy for touching a painting.

There’s a slight tentativeness to Kalfar’s written English (he was born in the Czech Republic, and immigrated to the United States at 15) that endears his protagonists, and renders them believable. He makes a virtue of a limitation. He has a Kurt Vonnegut-like satirical touch, at his best, as well as Vonnegut’s interest in science.

This reprieve lasted from about 2017 to 2019. Finally, I was free to do things I wanted, like chase chickens around a French monastery and write a murder mystery involving Chartreuse.

Then came BTS.

In April 2019, the month BTS released the album “Map of the Soul: Persona,” it became the first group since the Beatles to have three No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 chart within 12 months. Suddenly, people wanted me to talk only about BTS. And not just BTS but specifically how — according to some — BTS members were basically golems made by the South Korean government for the purpose of public diplomacy.

BTS has some 70 million followers on Instagram. Were these millions of people real or bots, people wanted to know. What is this mysterious group of superfans that calls itself the BTS ARMY (an acronym that may or may not stand for “Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth”)? Why does it have half a million dues-paying, literally card-carrying members? Who is recruiting them?

Conspiracy theories came to a fever pitch in June 2020 after Donald Trump held a rally in Tulsa, Okla. With the aim of trolling Mr. Trump and his supporters, K-pop fans on TikTok had joined forces to hog tickets, leaving seats empty at the rally. It may have worked: A Florida politician tweeted that the incident was “foreign propaganda.” He accused Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, K-pop agents (what are those?) and BTS (which he said stood for “Big Time Socialists”) of conspiring to undermine Mr. Trump. That’s when I realized the extent of BTS’s cultural clout: You’re nobody in America until someone calls you a socialist.

It gets better. Last year, a rumor went around that the new McDonald’s BTS Meals had something to do with sex trafficking, and it’s because a chicken nugget was shaped like a video game character. That is as much information as I can bear without screaming.

The rumor I helped call into existence has given me grief. At least it is truer than it was before Dec. 13: As army conscripts, BTS members will indeed be in the service of the Korean government. And with that, I may finally find the peace I have been seeking.

But “The Minister Primarily” isn’t a book about Africa. It’s about America, and the author has a lot to say about his homeland, starting with “Jimmy Johnson’s Poop Sheet for Jungle Travel,” which the fake prime minister writes up the night before the Washington visit and hands out to the half-cabinet that will be traveling with him. In “The Land of the Thief and the home of the slave,” he writes (borrowing from W. E. B. Du Bois), white Americans are “citizens.” Black Americans are “subjects.” A white man who drives a Cadillac is “affluent,” a Black one is a “conspicuous consumer, uncouth, stupid, loud, etc., etc.”

The moment they touch down in America, the dignitaries are greeted by a couple of bands playing “For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow,” and then they travel to the White House, where in the course of the evening, the president serves them whiskey, and then more whiskey, and says, “This is a social evening, Mr. Prime Meneceter, but I want you to know, we think of your fuh-fuh-fuh-fabulous country as the bulwark of democracy against godless communism.” He continues: “And with certain democratic provisional provisos and assurances and free world commitments, but with no strings attached, we are ready, willing and able to give all kinds of assistance, financial, educational, technical.” Then he clears his throat and explains, “And especially we are willing to help you get that cobanium out of the ground just as quick as we possibly can.”

Along with the realpolitik, there is fun to be had. Once in New York, the Guanayans go up to Harlem and to Jamaica, Queens, before heading off (of course) to Lolliloppi, Miss., where Jimmy Jay and the Guanayans teach K.K.K. members more about brotherly love than they ever thought possible. Even more than telling a fine tale, Killens wants to see grown men transformed. Inspired by Southern hospitality (and a warning from the president in Washington that nothing must disturb the smooth development of Guanayan-American relations), the erstwhile white supremacists of Lolliloppi discover their hidden humanity. It’s as if the white Southerners the Guanayans encounter, led by their fake prime minister, are touched by a magic wand; as a result of the Africans’ visit, they begin speaking of Lolliloppi’s mayor as governor — and even as president.

Killens has read his Shakespeare. With the surprises in its plot and its quadrilles of mistaken identities, “The Minister Primarily” is right up there with “The Tempest” and “The Comedy of Errors.” The choreography of his set pieces has an effulgent warmth that is as passionately expressed as it is disarming, creeping up on the reader with such skill you hardly realize you’re being stalked by a master. Killens’s writing about sex, of which there is a lot, both of the emotional tsunami kind and of the nothing-but-lust kind, should be used in creative writing courses across the country.

There is a generous contouring to his love for African America that is filled with pride. But the most powerful message that Killens has to impart is that lessons come in all shapes and sizes. Humor and satire are often more powerful than sermons or political finger-wagging. “The Minister Primarily” probably could not be written today. Amid the increasingly toxic discourse about race and politics, we have forgotten what we ever learned about laughter being the best medicine.

In 2020, Yamamoto designed the Circle at Zurich Airport, an indoor-outdoor complex of hotels, restaurants and stores featuring glass walls, windowed ceilings and thin concrete columns.

Typically airports “have only souvenir shops, but this is completely different,” Yamamoto said in 2016, adding that his complex “is not for the airport itself. The planned city is for local residents of the Zurich region.”

Born in 1945 in China and trained in Japan, Yamamoto was 5 when he lost his father, an engineer, whose career he sought to emulate, eventually finding his way to architecture. At the age of 17, he visited Kohfukuji Temple, in Nara, one of Japan’s most famous Buddhist shrines, with a history dating to the seventh century. There he was captivated by the five-story pagoda symbolizing the elements of earth, water, fire, air and space.

“It was very dark, but I could see the wooden tower illuminated by the light of the moon,” he said in the Pritzker biography, “and what I found at that moment was my first experience with architecture.”

In 1968, Yamamoto graduated from Nihon University and three years later received a Master of Arts in Architecture from Tokyo University of the Arts.

After a blistering 4-0 loss to Japan during group play, Spain Coach Jorge Vilda said that his team’s defeat had been psychic as well as numerical. “Mentally, of course,” Vilda said, “this has done some damage.”

After Japan defeated Norway by 3-1 in the round of 16, Caroline Graham Hansen, the Norwegian star who plays for the Champions League winner Barcelona, said that Japan showed why it might be the best team in the tournament.

“They’re so disciplined and very structured in the way they play offense and defense,” Hansen said.

Friday’s quarterfinal might play out as an engaging challenge of physicality versus technique. Sweden has scored four of its nine goals on corner kicks, a total that nearly grew last Sunday as it packed the six-yard box against the United States like a crowded elevator.

But the Swedes could not manage a goal in 90 minutes of regulation and 30 minutes of overtime before subduing the Americans, finally and microscopically, on penalty kicks.

Donald Trump and his party, having triumphed in an election in which they demonized trans people, seem hellbent on driving them out of public life. Democrats, some of whom blame the party for staking out positions on trans issues that they couldn’t publicly defend, are shellshocked and confused. Democratic leaders have been far too quiet as congressional Republicans, giddy and vengeful in victory, seek to humiliate their new colleague, Representative-elect Sarah McBride, a Democrat from Delaware, by barring her and other trans people from using the appropriate single-sex bathrooms in the Capitol.

I say this as someone who has been called a TERF, a contemptuous acronym that stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist, more times than I can count. For a decade now, I’ve been trying to balance a belief in the rights of trans people with my skepticism of some trans activist positions. I’ve written with a degree of sympathy about feminists who’ve been ostracized for wanting to maintain women’s-only spaces. I believe that the science behind youth gender medicine is unsettled, and I dislike jargon like “sex assigned at birth” that tries to mystify or elide the reality of biological sex. (Except for rare exceptions, doctors don’t “assign” sex, they identify it.) I care very little about sports, but it seems dishonest to deny that male puberty tends to confer advantages on trans women athletes.

Occasionally, I receive angry or plaintive messages from trans people accusing me of helping America down a slippery slope that has brought us to our lamentable present, when discrimination against trans people has been normalized to a degree that recently seemed unthinkable.

For most of the past week, I’ve been interviewing current and former members of Parliament about the mistreatment of women in Australian politics. I’ve spoken mainly to those with direct experience inside the system, and I found myself starting off with the same question: Does what’s happening now feel different?

Everyone — from Tanya Plibersek in Labor, to Dr. Anne Webster of the National Party, to Julia Banks, who gave up her Liberal Party seat in 2019 — responded with the same answer. Yes.

They all told me that, six weeks after Brittany Higgins spoke up with her allegation of rape in the defense minister’s office when she was a staffer in 2019, the dynamic has changed. Women are angry and unified, speaking up in politics and beyond. More of the men who used to brush off complaints of sexism as whining about the always-tough arena of politics have started to see that it’s an uneven playing field, where women compete with extra burdens and threats.

But is that enough to change the system, to make it fair and equal? Maybe not, they said — not yet.

“It feels different in terms of momentum, in terms of moving toward change,” Ms. Banks told me. “But I do worry about the leadership and the lack of accountability. That’s what it comes down to.

Even with widespread cancellations in European soccer, Formula One auto racing, and professional and collegiate basketball in the United States, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan vowed, “We will overcome the spread of the infection and host the Olympics without problem, as planned.”

While sports can create an escape hatch from the grit and grind of daily life, there is no escaping the fact that the coronavirus pandemic presents an extraordinary challenge that cannot be overcome with mere platitudes and prayers. Pressing ahead with the Tokyo Games means creating a massive, potentially perilous petri dish. For the sake of global public health, the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games should be canceled.

The Olympics are not slated to commence until July 24. But the International Olympic Committee’s response to the coronavirus has not been forward-thinking. After a recent meeting of the executive board, the I.O.C.’s president, Thomas Bach, stated that the board had not even mentioned the words “postponement” or “cancellation.” But organizers have delivered mixed messages. A Tokyo 2020 executive board member suggested delaying the Games, only to backpedal and apologize, while the organizing committee chairman, Yoshiro Mori, said, “Our basic stance is to proceed with our preparation and to hold a safe Olympics.” Japan’s Olympic minister, Seiko Hashimoto, hewed to a similar script: “The I.O.C. and 2020 organizers are not at all considering canceling or postponing the Games.”

In a communiqué issued Tuesday, the I.O.C. noted that its task force overseeing the situation was considering possible “adaptations” but that the I.O.C. “remains fully committed to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020,” adding, “with more than four months to go before the Games there is no need for any drastic decisions at this stage; and any speculation at this moment would be counterproductive.”",international olympic committee tokyo 2020 olympic organizers insist tokyo 2020 summer games go tokyo 2020 executive board member suggested delaying games backpedal,Japan,,7203.T,1085.3299560546875,1077.9921875,1091.302734375,1146.422119140625,-0.6760864300992135,1.2347535565975518,0.5503191252570149,5.628902320914028

Ads became an unavoidable part of modern life for a simple reason: They work. Each dollar that companies spent on advertising in the United States last year led to $9 in sales, the research firm IHS Markit estimated. And while the barrage of marketing messages can seem like background noise, their absence would be conspicuous.

The ad industry employs about 500,000 people in the United States. Their work blankets movie screens, smartphones, buildings, stadiums and inbox-clogging promotional emails. Companies that regularly buy ads are the lifeblood of TV networks, podcast companies, news outlets, lifestyle publications and pretty much all of the internet — and when they spend less on marketing, there is a ripple effect.

Now, the coronavirus that has brought business in neighboring China to a virtual standstill threatens to knock Japan into a full-blown recession.

Japan said on Monday that its economy had shrunk at an annualized rate of 6.3 percent in the three months that ended in December, the worst contraction since mid-2014. The results predated the virus epidemic but were affected by a monthslong slump in Chinese demand for Japanese exports.

Officials had been optimistic that an easing of the effects of Typhoon Hagibis and the consumption tax increase would return the country to growth as the new year began. But then the coronavirus began its deadly spread in China, halting the lucrative flow of tourists from that country and further imperiling Japanese exports.

The prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, laid out the goal during his first major policy speech since taking office in September, when Japan’s longest-serving leader, Shinzo Abe, abruptly resigned. The announcement came just weeks after China, Japan’s regional rival, said it would reduce its net carbon emissions to zero by 2060.

Addressing Japan’s Parliament, Mr. Suga called for the country to “be carbon neutral in 2050,” a declaration that drew loud applause from lawmakers. Achieving that goal will be good not only for the world, he said, but also for Japan’s economy and global standing.

“Taking an aggressive approach to global warming will bring about a transformation in our industrial structure and economic system that will lead to big growth” in the economy, he said, answering critics who have warned of the economic consequences.",prime minister yoshihide suga laid goal first major policy speech announcement came weeks china said would reduce net carbon emissions,Japan,,7203.T,1227.7071533203125,1230.699951171875,1225.59423828125,1213.9739990234375,0.24377131333547505,-0.4148625248390828,-0.1721025273289447,-1.1186017984609706

Marlowe is, of course, the most famous creation of Raymond Chandler, perhaps the most famous of American crime novelists. Reading Chandler was always a guilty pleasure of mine, his vision of 1930s Los Angeles unfolding vividly for me all the way in cold and rainy Glasgow. On the one hand, there is his glorious writing, his blue-collar heroes and the occasional profound observations about the human experience. But there’s also his liberal use of racial slurs, his portrayal of people of color and homosexuals as grotesque caricatures and the fact that his work is suffused with misogyny. It takes a strong stomach to read a story in which a woman needs a slap to calm her down.

Crime fiction was, and is, anti-feminist. That’s why I chose to write it in the first place.

Traditionally, women never had agency in crime fiction, and when I started out I wanted to try to shift the dial, casting in with a movement that already counted such lights as Sara Paretsky, Marcia Talley, Mary Wings and Val McDermid. The way I saw it, crime fiction was the new social novel, wrapped in a genre that already seemed to be reaching a wide audience of largely female readers.

The knock on commercial fiction is that it’s often written so quickly that it tends to simply mirror, for good or ill, the social mores of the time that produced it. Chandler may have been a misogynist, but he definitely lived in misogynist times, and his fiction reflects that. When values change or views become more enlightened, these kind of books tend to age poorly. Sometimes this aging-out happens quite suddenly: How tired the endless copaganda procedurals seem now; how tone-deaf the books that end with the police justifiably shooting a suspect to death. The tsunami of books featuring women with faulty memories cannot be read in the same way since the #MeToo movement or in the context of changing attitudes about sexual violence and child abuse. Overnight, yesterday’s resilient trope seems hopelessly offensive, even dangerous.

Yet this same ability to mirror a moment, which potentially imperils a book’s longevity, also confers a great advantage to a commercial writer: the chance to change the way we speak collectively about a moment and become a powerful driver of social change. “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” by Harriet Beecher Stowe may not be read much now, but through the 19th century it was outsold only by the Bible. “What Is to Be Done?,” a 1863 novel by Nikolai Chernyshevsky, arguably had a bigger impact on the worldview of Vladimir Lenin than did Marx’s “Capital.” Imagined realities can be just as revolutionary as any written manifesto — and much more accessible and fun to read.

Despite incessant internal jockeying that has often led to a revolving door of leaders (a problem that remains), the party has governed Japan almost continuously since 1955, staunchly adhering to an alliance with the United States that has ensured peace, security, some of the highest living standards in world history and perhaps our most precious commodity: stability.

But elections on Sunday — in which Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba lost the majority in the lower house of Parliament previously held by the L.D.P. and its coalition partner Komeito — make clear that Japan’s prized political stability is no more. The Liberal Democrats, the country’s indispensable political force for so long, is losing its way. It is in disarray and weakened by scandals that have contributed to growing public disgust with the status quo.

All of this is happening as Japan faces some of its biggest challenges in decades. The economy, which has alternated between anemic growth and recession for many years, slipped back into recession late last year and barely grew in the most recent quarter. The yen hit a nearly four-decade low this summer. It remains unclear how Japan can continue to pay for the spiraling long-term social welfare needs of its rapidly aging population while following through on plans to raise military spending to meet the growing threat posed by China and nuclear-armed dictatorships like North Korea and Russia.

These are generational challenges that will require tough choices — and strong and steady leadership. But the L.D.P.’s grip and its ability to inspire the Japanese public have been weakening since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stepped down in 2020 because of declining health. Mr. Abe, who was assassinated two years ago, spent nearly nine years in power, the most of any leader since the establishment of Japan’s first cabinet in 1885.

The two books together sold for more than $2 million. (Dr. Cottom, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, writes a newsletter for The New York Times.)

At home in Bangkok, I often pickle: Texan okra, Hunan long beans, miso garlic and kosher dills. But until the coronavirus pandemic, my job as an international correspondent for The New York Times required a lot of time not being at home. Nukazuke was off-limits because it requires the ministrations of a homemaker, the daily turning of the rice bran, or nuka, so it doesn’t spoil into a moldy mess.

When Thailand all but closed its borders this past spring, it became clear that I would be an international correspondent without much international corresponding to do. And so one of the first things I did was to get my hands on some nuka. I added the salt, kelp and vegetable scraps needed to achieve the proper environment for lacto-fermentation and began to pickle.

To me, the sour-salty punch of a good nukazuke is a taste of home, even if I never actually lived in Japan, except for childhood summers at my grandmother’s cedar-scented house, chasing fireflies, watching fireworks and learning from her in the kitchen.

The no-confidence motion was supported by only 128 lawmakers in the 577-seat National Assembly, France’s lower house, short of the absolute majority required. Had it passed, the motion would have forced the centrist prime minister, François Bayrou, and his cabinet to resign.

The motion’s failure ensures safe passage of a 2025 budget bill that France needs badly — it has been operating with temporary stopgap funding since the start of the year — and that the government hopes will rein in the country’s surging debt and deficit, with a goal of generating 50 billion euros in savings through tax increases and spending cuts.

We’re exploring how America defines itself one place at a time. In San Francisco, a city that loves the new, many residents are flocking to an old cathedral.

Aug. 10, 2024

San Francisco residents have always celebrated the new, the innovative, the cutting-edge. The weirder, the better. But these days, they are flocking to a surprising venue for the cool factor: a church that is older than the city itself.

High atop Nob Hill, above the clanging cable cars and luxury hotels, stands the majestic Grace Cathedral. The Episcopal congregation dates back to 1849, the year before the city was incorporated, when pews were filled with miners tossing gold dust into the offering plates at a precursor to the current building.

The Gothic cathedral, built in 1927 for the same congregation, has for decades been home to traditional religious rites and events: Sunday services, baptisms, weddings, funerals and Christmas choral performances. But in the past few years, it has boomed for reasons that have nothing to do with the Bible. Just the other week, a public art display featuring colorful lasers beamed from the roof of the nearby Fairmont Hotel into the big, round window at the front of the cathedral. The event drew more than 1,000 onlookers, including Sergey Brin, the billionaire co-founder of Google, and Kudra Kalema, a Ugandan prince and tech founder.",grace cathedral built 1927 congregation episcopal congregation dates back 1849 year city incorporated cathedral decades home traditional religious rites events,America,,TRV,209.8144989013672,207.0989990234375,208.2345733642578,211.404296875,-1.2942384306845407,0.5483243985606125,-0.7530106572149194,0.7577159738518209

When we are understaffed and overworked, when there is no staff to triage patients, when more and more patients are piling up at the emergency department door, the system breaks down, then people break down. You can borrow ventilators (until you can’t) and make more personal protective equipment (we hope). You cannot magically produce more nurses, respiratory therapists, physicians or other professionals.

My colleagues and I witnessed the physical and emotional devastation of the health care work force in Wuhan, China; in Italy; in New York. Health care workers were catching the coronavirus on the front lines, getting sick, getting their families sick, dying. We saw them suffer the lasting scars of feeling helpless in the face of this new coronavirus, unable to save their patients or themselves. We did what we could to prepare ourselves for when the pandemic would hit our community, knowing it was just a matter of time.

A group of us from a variety of backgrounds began building a coalition called HCW Hosted to help local health care workers find quarantine housing to isolate from our families. We have since added other services: health-status monitoring, emotional-health support and psychological first aid. These support services have helped fill some of the gaps our employers and government infrastructure have failed to address. But even if every city and town had an organization like HCW Hosted, that would still be only part of what is needed to mitigate the impact of Covid-19.

I get angry when I see people refuse to wear a mask or physically distance from others or stay home when they could because it is inconvenient — or as a political statement. If you do not wear a mask and physically distance, you are putting yourself and others in harm’s way. You are putting us in harm’s way. Then you will expect us to risk our lives to save you. And it’s not just we whom you ask to risk our lives, but our families as well. What you are saying to people like me and my team is, “Your life and the lives of your loved ones do not matter to us; you are disposable.”

I am willing to sacrifice for the greater good of the public. I took an oath to that effect when I became a physician. But the public has to sacrifice some too if we want to get through this as safely as possible — social scientists call this “health citizenship.” It means contacting your elected representatives and imploring them to follow public health science when they set policy — and voting out those who won’t.

In Texas, a federal court ruled this week that a state regulation granting blanket absentee-ballot privileges to voters over 65 — a not-uncommon exception nationally — discriminated against younger voters.

Elsewhere, lawsuits have sought to expand a common exception allowing absentee voting by people too sick to go to the polls. The goal is to cover voters who fear catching the coronavirus while in line at a polling place. A number of states have adopted that view, ruling that voters who reasonably fear exposure to the virus have a right to vote remotely.

Jocelyn Benson, the Democratic secretary of state in Michigan, said this week that the state would mail applications for absentee ballots to all 7.7 million registered voters for both the August primary and the November general election. The Legislature in deeply Republican South Carolina expanded absentee voting rights last week as a lawsuit pressing that cause lay before the state’s Supreme Court.

In West Virginia, the Republican secretary of state sent absentee ballot applications last month to each of the state’s 1.2 million registered voters; so far, nearly one in five has asked to vote absentee.

President Biden’s $2 trillion American Jobs Plan — the first of a two-part package — is being picked apart by Republican lawmakers. They object to its price tag. They object to funding it by rolling back some of the 2017 tax cuts. And they vehemently object to the White House’s redefinition of infrastructure to encompass things like roads, ports, broadband, community colleges, electric-vehicle charging stations and elder care.

Republicans have countered with a radically reduced plan stripped of provisions they do not consider infrastructure. Their biggest target for elimination: Mr. Biden’s call to invest $400 billion in community-based and in-home care for older and disabled people. Characterized as “infrastructure of care” by the White House, the provision accounts for nearly 20 percent of the total cost of the president’s plan. Republican lawmakers are having none of it.

Republicans have a semantic point: The administration’s position that any policy aimed at helping people live productive lives should count as infrastructure stretches the term “infrastructure” to its limit. Within these parameters, it’s hard to think of a measure that wouldn’t qualify.

It is nonetheless hard to fault Mr. Biden for seeking to prioritize elder care. America has long been facing — or rather, refusing to face — the challenges of its rapidly graying population.

Publicly, Dr. Birx has been a soothing constant next to Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in coronavirus meetings and briefings, where she has been one of the few regulars in a rotating cast of health officials perched behind the White House lectern.

The first sentence of Emmanuel Carrère’s novel “Yoga” outlines the whole book, so I give nothing away by saying that it is about trying to write what Carrère calls “a subtle little book on yoga,” an effort derailed, over the course of four years, by terrorism, the refugee crisis, the loss of his editor and a “melancholic depression” so deep that he is committed to a psychiatric hospital. Yet it is also a book about yoga, about the ways in which meditation means, to borrow a phrase from Lenin, as Carrère does, “working with the available material.”

The book begins with Carrère leaving his Paris apartment for a Vipassana retreat in central France during which he plans to spend 10 days honing his meditation skills and taming his ego. He will be allowed no contact with others, not with other guests (everyone is expected to observe a code of silence), not with outsiders by phone (he compliantly leaves his at home). He wonders about the men with whom he is grouped: “Who’s single, who’s been dumped, who’s poor or unhappy. Who’s emotionally fragile, who’s solid. Who risks being overwhelmed by the vertigo of silence.” But mostly he wonders about himself — about his ability to stay the course, about what it all means.

Carrère is among France’s most celebrated writers. His best books are what he has called “nonfiction novels” that take as their subject himself (his inner life, his romantic attachments) and expand outward to encompass larger themes of (often violent) loss. In “Yoga,” he is keenly aware of the tightrope he is walking — of the narcissistic smugness a 60-year-old upper-class white man spouting about “yin and yang” can tip into. He is as quick to poke fun at his companions as at his rosy vision of an “upgraded Emmanuel” awash in “wonder and serenity.” Even as Carrère regards his own meditation practice with ironic detachment, he has a genuine feeling for his tai chi and Iyengar masters. He gnaws at that contradiction in ways that bear, with humor and wit, on his own literary project. Within a few pages, he describes how the guy who holds forth on “letting go” reminds him of a former schoolteacher with anger issues, recalls meditating while drunk, evokes the pleasures of tantric sex, references Nietzsche, Freud, Diogenes, Glenn Gould and B.K.S. Iyengar, to arrive, finally, at what might be his central theme: why meditation, real meditation, is like writing. “Writing down everything that goes through your head ‘without fabrication’ is exactly the same as observing your breathing without modifying it.”

Carrère places himself in the class of writers who, like their “patron saint” Montaigne, seek to transcribe “what comes into their heads.” This may seem simple — Thomas Bernhard, whom he cites, says “all you have to do is tilt your head and drop everything onto a sheet of paper” — but it requires both patience and speed.

tsunami,The Idea of American Decay,2022-01-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/podcasts/america-decline-capitol-riot.html,"America, U.S.","From “The Daily” newsletter: One big idea on the news, from the team that brings you “The Daily” podcast.

The idea that America is in decline isn’t new.

For decades, academics have warned that partisan gridlock, politicized courts and unfettered lobbying were like dangerous substances — if taken in excess, America’s democratic systems were at risk of collapse.

But what happens when the idea itself gets mainlined? When words like “died,” “decline” and “dagger” sit near “America” on front pages across the country? When a majority of the American public rewrites the story they tell themselves about their country’s standing in the world?

That’s what some experts say is happening now — that the Capitol riot and its aftermath have normalized a sense among Americans that the country, its economic system and its standing in the world are in decline. New data supports this claim: 70 percent of Americans believe the U.S. is “in crisis and at risk of failing,” according to a recent poll.",capitol riot aftermath normalized sense among americans country decline 70 percent americans believe us crisis risk failing according recent poll,America,,TRV,151.96786499023438,155.62826538085938,153.58741760253906,152.74484252929688,2.4086673790279423,-1.3113606151979351,1.0657204484703142,0.5112775250954729

Even when the characters in “Drive My Car” share the same bed, the same room or the same Saab, there’s a gulf between them that can’t always be closed.

Hamaguchi agreed. “We are physically separated and yet we’re able to connect online,” he said. “It’s that thing of being connected and yet, at the same time, not.”

To illustrate what he meant, Hamaguchi recalled that 10 years ago, while working on a documentary about the aftermath of the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami, he traveled through eastern Japan interviewing survivors. As he lent those people a camera and his trust, deeply buried thoughts came spilling out of them.

“After the interviews, I wrote out the words, and I realized that the ones that really shook me were the words that were quite normal or ordinary,” he said. “They were things that perhaps these people had already thought but had never thought to verbalize until that moment.”

The same is true when it comes to the “Drive My Car” characters, whose internal struggles can only reach the level of epiphany when they find someone to confide in.

“It’s possible that when the characters say what they’re thinking, the audience could think, ‘Oh, they didn’t actually know this?’ But it’s about the journey of being able to get to a place to verbalize that, and for that journey to happen, it’s because someone is there to witness it,” Hamaguchi said. “Somebody being there to listen has an incredible power.”",hamaguchi thing connected yet time even characters drive car share bed room,Japan,,7203.T,1930.48046875,1844.9530029296875,1852.6458740234375,1760.7828369140625,-4.430371982768214,0.41696840415631886,-4.031876829966633,-8.790435054016264
tsunami,The Question President Biden Needs to Ask Himself. Now.,2024-07-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/opinion/biden-trump-step-aside.html,"Washington, Chicago, America","So, what keeps Trump up at 3 a.m.? My guess is a scenario where Biden turns to his family and his top advisers and pulls out a line from the musical “Hamilton”:

George Washington: I’m stepping down. I’m not running for president. Alexander Hamilton: I’m sorry, what? Washington: One last time. Relax, have a drink with me. One last time. Let’s take a break tonight. And then we’ll teach them how to say goodbye.

Yes, what Trump fears most right now is that Biden will teach the country how to say goodbye.

He fears that Biden will demonstrate the difference between a leader and a party who put the country first and a leader and a party who put themselves first, namely Trump and the Republicans who enable him despite knowing how many of Trump’s former advisers say he is unfit for office, despite knowing that Trump tried to overturn the last election, despite knowing that Trump has articulated no real plan for the country’s future other than “retribution” against all who crossed him and his followers.

How might Biden do what is best for the country and worst for Trump — a small man at a big time who is so unwilling to say goodbye that he will not even admit he lost the election in 2020 fair and square? Not by scrambling to shift a few panicky donors to his side to tough it out until November, insisting that he just had one bad debate night. And not by daring the party to remove him. He should elevate himself and the party above the whole fray.

That would entail declaring that he will release the delegates who vowed to vote for his nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and work with the party to set up an orderly process between now and then for the next generation of Democratic candidates to make their cases to the public, and for the convention delegates to choose a new nominee. (By the way, a convention vote is how Lincoln and both Roosevelts got nominated — and that worked out pretty well for the country.)

Biden could, if he wishes, endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, or he could remain neutral. But he should make clear that the nomination must be decided by an open competition. For the six weeks leading up to the convention and at the convention itself, everyone in America will be listening closely as the best of the next generation of Democrats present a hopeful vision for the country. What a contrast with a Republican convention whose only platform is the whims of their dear leader. Will it be messy? Sure, it will. But every alternative is messy now.

Biden could add that once an alternative Democratic ticket is nominated, he will use his bully pulpit — and the credibility and admiration that this gesture will surely earn him from Americans of all political stripes — to ensure that they defeat Trump.",trump fears biden demonstrate difference leader party put country first biden could endorse kamala harris could remain neutral,Washington,,WY,27.020864486694336,26.94243049621582,26.520841598510742,27.04047393798828,-0.2902719508368736,-1.5647767849463028,-1.8505066276832702,0.07257151710894164

The cause was complications of cancer, said Casey Dolan, his stepson.

Mr. Gesner, who was raised in California, could ski and surf like a pro. He flew his first plane at 14. The actress June Lockhart was his first love, during his senior year at Santa Monica High School — she went to Westlake, they met water-skiing — but their romance was interrupted by his service in World War II.

As an architect he was largely self-taught, though Frank Lloyd Wright invited him to study at Taliesin West, his estate and school in Scottsdale, Ariz.

It belongs on the shelf next to recent ambitious and eclectic books by authors like Jared Diamond, Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Steven Pinker. What unites these writers is their disregard for traditional disciplinary boundaries and a determination to reach for synoptic knowledge of stupefyingly complex subjects.

The result, in Ferguson’s case, is a book containing some genuine wisdom, but also some perplexing lacunae. One of its concluding lessons for the current pandemic, for example, is that lockdowns, which do great economic damage, should be avoided in favor of more precisely targeted measures, among them the quarantining of superspreaders — people who interact with far more people than most and therefore play an outsize role in spreading disease.

That sounds reasonable. Yet 300 or so pages earlier, in a section of the book’s introduction titled “Confessions of a Superspreader,” Ferguson tells us he “first spoke and wrote publicly about the rising probability of a global pandemic” long before most Western journalists, in late January 2020, while he was in the midst of a round of travel that took him from the United States to Asia, Europe and then back to North America. His travels continued over the following weeks, despite his awareness of the risk and the fact that he was “ill for most of February, with a painful cough I could not shake off.” The globe-trotting finally came to an end on March 15, when Ferguson flew with his wife and two youngest children to Montana, where they would ride out the pandemic in rural isolation.

Since one of the central purposes of the book is to show his readers that “all disasters are at some level man-made,” one might have expected Ferguson to reflect, beyond a cleverly self-deprecating section title, on his own possible role in spreading Covid around the world. This is a book, after all, containing a chapter titled “The Fractal Geometry of Disaster,” about how “nested within a massive event like the collapse of an empire are multiple smaller but similar disasters, each one, at each scale, a microcosm of the whole.” Yet Ferguson’s own arguably irresponsible actions do not inform his analysis in any notable way.

This is probably a function of Ferguson’s preference for highlighting systemic, as opposed to individual, failures. Eschewing great man theories of history, Ferguson treats political leaders as “hubs” within complex networks of information. When those hubs communicate efficiently with one another, the results are good. But when communication breaks down or information is less than accurate, a cascade of failures ensues that makes a disaster far worse. Superspreaders are hubs, too, within social networks, though in their case the more connections they have with others, the worse, since those connections spread disease far and wide. Hence, Ferguson says, the need to build an institutional infrastructure that can disrupt social networks in times of emergency to halt contagion.",doom book containing genuine wisdom also perplexing lacunae one concluding lessons current pandemic lockdowns avoided yet fergusons arguably irresponsible,the United States,,TRV,144.1371612548828,145.92286682128906,146.62242126464844,141.52301025390625,1.2388932533842012,0.4794001506399374,1.7242326601471305,-1.8136551172628321

Can It Continue?,2020-12-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/books/trump-administration-books-2021.html,"Washington, St. Martin’s","Penguin also acquired a new book from the Washington Post reporters Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, the co-authors of “A Very Stable Genius,” published early this year. Their sequel will explore the last year of Mr. Trump’s presidency, as he faced impeachment, played down the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, was hospitalized with Covid-19 and fought to overturn the results of the election. Doubleday, another Penguin Random House imprint, acquired a book that will be co-written by Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, and Susan Glasser, a writer for The New Yorker, which will analyze how Trump has changed the culture and politics of Washington.

“The books that will endure are those that shape historical perspectives about the period,” said Kristine Puopolo, editorial director of nonfiction at Doubleday. “We’re moving into a new phase where we are going to see Trump as history. We’ve seen that it is only after people leave an administration that they’re open to being completely candid.”

In some ways, the continued tsunami of titles is no surprise. Whenever a new president enters the White House, there’s often a surge of books that analyze the previous administration, the key moments of the election and the challenges that the new president will face.

Still, there’s no doubt that publishers are likely to soon face the end of a very lucrative era. Trump’s presidency has been an enormous boon for the publishing industry, with breakout hits by former administration officials (John Bolton, James Comey and “Anonymous,” who later revealed himself as Miles Taylor, a former official at the Department of Homeland Security), exposés by journalists (Woodward, Michael Wolff) and tell-alls from estranged confidantes and protégés (Michael Cohen, Omarosa Manigault Newman).

Now, Ms. Solís said, the fact that Mr. Abe was able to avoid an outright cancellation of the Games “will be seen as a skillful management.”

As the world records more than two and a half million deaths from the coronavirus and the United States celebrates over 50 million administered vaccines, here at the Royal Melbourne Hospital emergency department, as frontline workers, we scheduled ourselves for our first immunization this week. Australia has not recorded a coronavirus death for months now, and the little outbreaks we have peter out within days because of aggressive lockdowns and a compliant public. Given the low prevalence of disease, Australians have the luxury of choosing not to be vaccinated or to delay the vaccine until we are ready.

Until last week, I wasn’t sure I would get the vaccine. Some media reports highlight that mRNA vaccines have never been approved for use in humans outside clinical trials, making it seem like a new technology that has not been tested before. The vaccines were developed at such speed, I couldn’t be sure that major side effects hadn’t been overlooked. I worried about autoimmunity caused by expressing the coronavirus spike proteins on my own cells.

Skepticism runs deep in Australia, and anti-vaccine protests have popped up in many of our cities. Outside this vocal minority — which seems to oppose immunization based on theoretical and ideological rather than scientific concerns — it is difficult to gauge the popular mood. I get the sense that Australians feel obligated to be vaccinated, but privately many of us have reservations.

“Reformers, scientists, doctors, professors, all of the educated women who were doing so much work for human rights, that their voices, all that talent is now just silenced,” she said. “And the fact that there are Afghan women like Nargis who made it here and can use their voices, it’s a spot of joy in a very sad story.”",nargis baran still adjusting life foreign city without significant afghan community struggles sense guilt left country taliban reimposed rules,Washington,,WY,29.8935489654541,29.717069625854492,29.550395965576172,30.981836318969727,-0.5903592771923946,-0.5608684247026519,-1.1479165631169714,3.6405424955507395

Cannes is a thoroughly French affair, but its love for le cinéma américain is evident everywhere from the faded images of Hollywood stars that are scattered about to the honorary awards that the event bestows. On Saturday, it will present an honorary Palme d’Or to George Lucas, the 11th American to get an award that it’s given out just 22 times.

Given the United States’ long domination of the international film market, it’s no surprise that the country looms large here. The Disney adventure “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” it is worth pointing out, was No. 1 at the box office in France and in much of the rest of the world when Cannes opened last week; it still is. That said, the hold that American cinema maintains on this festival goes beyond market share. Americans have also won more top awards at Cannes than filmmakers from Britain, Italy or France. This fact reminds me of the moment in “Kings of the Road,” the 1976 Wim Wenders road movie, when a character says, “The Yanks have colonized our subconscious.”

There are always movies from around the world here, of course, but the selections that often generate the loudest chatter are either from the United States or are Hollywood-adjacent. Three such titles this year are a heat-seeking troika that involve American notables who, after a period of relative domestic quiet, have showily returned to the international stage. Kevin Costner is here with “Horizon: An American Saga,” a baggy western that’s the first chapter in a multipart series, and Francis Ford Coppola has a new epic, “Megalopolis.” Then there’s Demi Moore, who’s being hailed for her bold starring role in “The Substance,” an English-language horror movie from the French director Coralie Fargeat.",cannes thoroughly french affair love le cinema americain evident saturday present honorary palme dor george lucas americans also,France,,DG.PA,113.528076171875,113.03296661376953,114.32024383544922,113.3795394897461,-0.4361119952001135,1.138851133650484,0.6977724720490482,-0.13083695869560075

In Japan, people still watch the same TV shows at the same time. Twenty years ago, it was so rare for normal people to go on television, and I think this show kind of broke that. But there’s a power imbalance as well. People didn’t know to talk about contracts and think about their rights. Everyone just wanted to be on television.

TITLEY We know now that if you go on a show, you should be prepared to be manipulated in some way. It was the Wild West of TV programming, where producers had so much control. There were no contracts. I wonder sometimes how far we’ve really come. It’s easy to look back and think about the cruelty of it, but it was interesting when we first met Tsuchiya and asked him if something like this could happen now. His response is that the Japanese would never do something as cruel and twisted as “Love Island.”

She sank to the floor, dipping her hands into two wooden chests filled with antique Indonesian textiles.

In one chest, Ms. Komara recently recalled, were batik designs from the island of Java, in the other elaborate weavings from Indonesia’s outer islands. She swallowed more wine, inhaled clove-scented smoke from an Indonesian cigarette — and considered how to enrich the heritage of a nation of more than 17,000 islands.

The state lacks building standards that would better protect structures against wildfires, for example, by requiring the use of fire-resistant materials and construction techniques, or by maintaining space around structures that are clear of flammable vegetation.

That puts Hawaii out of step with much of the country: 21 states, including California and most other Western states, have adopted those standards, according to the International Code Council, the Washington-based nonprofit group that compiles them.

Last month, Gov. Josh Green of Hawaii issued an order that stops the state from adopting new or updated building standards. The governor said the move was necessary to address a severe housing shortage.

Attempts to block tougher building codes in the name of affordability are common nationwide, even if it sacrifices safety, said Michele Steinberg, wildfire division director for the National Fire Protection Association.",state lacks building standards would better protect structures wildfires 21 states including california western states adopted standards,California,,PCG,16.885974884033203,16.577512741088867,16.6372127532959,16.6173152923584,-1.8267357677761749,0.36012647457696934,-1.473187852319534,-1.5910220968576707

So They Called the Insurance Guy.,2022-11-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/21/climate/nature-conservancy-insurance-hawaii-coral-reef.html,"Oahu, Washington, D.C., the United States, Hawaii","As climate change makes coastal storms more destructive, an environmental group is trying a new approach to protecting Hawaii’s coral reefs. It could become a model for defending natural structures around the country — if it works.

The plan involves an urgent sequence of actions that, in theory, will unfold like this:

Step 1: The Nature Conservancy, a large environmental nonprofit, takes out an insurance policy for the coral reefs surrounding the islands of Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Maui and Hawaii, despite not owning those reefs, which are on public land.

Step 2: If Hawaii experiences a storm strong enough to damage the reefs, the Nature Conservancy will get a payout from the insurance company within about two weeks. (Compared with most insurance policies, that is the approximate equivalent of light speed.)

Step 3: The Nature Conservancy will ask the state of Hawaii, which owns the reefs, for a permit to repair the storm damage. While permission isn’t guaranteed, the odds seem good considering Hawaii doesn’t have the money to do the work itself.

Step 4: If state officials say yes, the conservancy will use the insurance money to pay teams of divers to start repairing the damage. This stage most closely resembles a race: They have about six weeks, starting from the storm. After that, the broken coral dies, further shrinking Hawaii’s best protection against future storms.

On Monday, the Nature Conservancy, which is based near Washington, D.C., completed the first step and bought a $2 million insurance policy on Hawaii’s coral reefs. It is the first insurance policy in the United States for a natural structure, according to the group, following similar efforts in Latin America. The conservancy says that if the experiment is successful, it will look at expanding the model to other states and include other natural features that shield against storms, such as mangroves, wetlands or coastal dunes.

“We think we can help our Hawaii state government put this into place as a pilot project,” said Makale’a Ane, who leads community engagement and partnerships in Hawaii for the Nature Conservancy. “It’s not simple.”",environmental group trying new approach protecting hawaiis coral reefs could become model defending natural structures around country works,Washington,,WY,29.398881912231445,29.17112159729004,29.435319900512695,28.93425178527832,-0.7747244117016785,0.905684419234672,0.12394344924420383,-1.5804346857144083

Many residents had been at home, getting ready for work and school, when the quake struck. Others were driving on highways or had already set off on early hikes in Taiwan’s national parks ahead of a four-day holiday. After the main quake stopped, people across the island fled on to the streets to assess damaged buildings and quickly text friends and family members reassurances and pictures of broken belongings.

That release included “Energy Flow,” originally written for a commercial for a vitamin drink and released as a single after television viewers called in en masse to ask how they could find the music. Amid Japan’s Lost Decade — a term for the economic stagnation that followed years of technology-driven growth — the tender piano ballad seemed to offer solace.

“Perhaps it’s because people are looking for healing, for some answer to the stress of their country’s recession,” Mr. Sakamoto speculated, when “Energy Flow” became the first instrumental track to reach No. 1, in 1999, on Japan’s Oricon charts.

After the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station in 2011, Mr. Sakamoto became an activist in Japan’s antinuclear movement, organizing a No Nukes concert in 2012 at which a reunited Yellow Magic Orchestra, and the band Kraftwerk, one of Yellow Magic’s major influences, performed.

The day before the concert, he spoke at a protest outside the residence of Japan’s prime minister. “I come here as a citizen,” he said. “It’s important that we all do what we can and raise our voices.”

No society can safeguard public health for long at the cost of its overall economic health, The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board writes. Resources to fight the virus aren’t limitless, the board says, and the costs of this national shutdown will soon cause “a tsunami of economic destruction” that will cause tens of millions to lose their jobs.

We don’t have enough reliable data about the disease’s fatality rate to be making such drastic economic sacrifices, Dr. John Ioannidis, a Stanford epidemiology professor, argues at Stat. What would happen, he asks, if we simply let the disease run its course? Even in the most pessimistic scenario, the coronavirus would kill about 40 million people worldwide, roughly matching the 1918 flu pandemic. But afterward, he says, life would hopefully continue, as it did after the flu. Conversely, the short-term and long-term consequences of an economic shutdown are entirely unknown, and billions, not just millions, of lives could be put at stake.

A better way to fight the pandemic is to isolate the most vulnerable, Dr. David L. Katz argues in The Times. He suggests the United States focus its resources on testing and protecting the elderly, people with chronic diseases and the immunologically compromised.

Tuesday’s most consequential result was Gov. Kathy Hochul’s victory over her Republican opponent, Representative Lee Zeldin, who ran a spirited campaign but fell short.

“This race was a once-in-a-generation campaign with a very close margin in the bluest of blue states,” Mr. Zeldin said in a concession on Wednesday afternoon.

Indeed, in a state where they are outnumbered by registered Democrats by more than two to one, Republicans posted their strongest statewide performance in decades, using crime and inflation to outrun their party’s performance nationally.

“His job wasn’t to get things done but to stop certain things from happening, to prevent disaster.” This line from Peter Baker and Susan Glasser’s detail-rich history of the Trump administration, “The Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017-2021,” technically applies to his first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. But in truth it describes any of several dozen beleaguered helpmates to the former president, whose propensity for petulant rage kept Washington in a fit of indignation and the White House in a mode of perpetual damage control for the better part of four years. Comprehensively researched and briskly told, “The Divider” is a story of disasters averted as well as disasters realized.

Squeezing the tumultuous events of the long national fever dream that was the Donald Trump presidency between two covers — even two covers placed far apart, as is the case with this 752-page anvil — would tax the skills of the nimblest journalist. Yet the husband-and-wife team of Baker and Glasser pull it off with assurance. It’s all here: the culture wars and the corruption, the demagogy and the autocrat-love, the palace intrigue and the public tweets, the pandemic and the impeachments (plural).

To be sure, asking readers in 2022 to revisit the Sturm und Drang of the Trump years may seem like asking a Six Flags patron, staggering from a ride on the Tsunami, to jump back on for another go. But those with strong stomachs will find a lot they didn’t know, and a lot more that they once learned but maybe, amid the daily barrage of breaking-news banner headlines, managed to forget.

Baker, The New York Times’s chief White House correspondent, and Glasser, a staff writer at The New Yorker, are the perfect pair to write this book, with a combined 60 years of Washington reporting experience and two other jointly authored books to their names. (I know both of them through professional circles; when Glasser edited Politico Magazine, she hired me to write a history column.) For a book produced so quickly, they draw on an impressively broad array of materials: hundreds of original interviews, reams of contemporary daily journalism, and an already-fat library of memoirs and journalistic accounts of the Trump years, including those by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker, and Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin.

Poland wants a fleet of smaller nuclear power stations to help end its reliance on coal. Britain is betting on Rolls-Royce to produce cheap modular reactors to complement wind and solar energy. And in France, President Emmanuel Macron plans to build on the nation’s huge nuclear program.

As world leaders pledge to avert a climate catastrophe, the nuclear industry sees an opportunity for a revival. Sidelined for years after the disasters at Fukushima and Chernobyl, advocates are wrangling to win recognition of nuclear energy, alongside solar and wind, as an acceptable source of clean power.

More than half a dozen European countries recently announced plans to build a new generation of nuclear reactors. Some are smaller and cheaper than older designs, occupying the space of two football fields and costing a fraction of the price of standard nuclear plants.

The responses hardly amounted to a diplomatic breakthrough.

The Iranians angrily dismissed the offer, calling it insincere and demanding broader relief from crippling American sanctions. The North Koreans, angry with the United States over stalled nuclear negotiations, said they appreciated the offer but did not publicly accept, warning of “big difficulties” in their relationship with the United States.

But the two cases illustrate the way Mr. Trump continues to pursue his foreign policy goals amid the pandemic, and the way the virus is shaping his approach. Administration officials see the crisis as creating new opportunities, but it also brings new risks as China and Russia seek to take advantage of a moment of perceived weakness and disarray for their American adversaries.

And Wright keeps us hooked with his details. Young doctors write their wills. Barney Graham, who designed the vaccine produced by Moderna, tells of his extreme terror about making a mistake. In a chapter titled “Thelma and Louise,” we see Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, going on road trips — crisscrossing the country eight times to promote masking to state governors, keeping a restraining eye on her colleague, Irum Zaidi, at the wheel (she has a thing for speeding). And turns out, the bogus idea that hydroxychloroquine can cure Covid originated as a mindless tweet from a mountain-dwelling white supremacist who also predicted that the coronavirus would destroy feminism. Who knew!

Disasters are, of course, unequally destructive — in terms of both economics and the threat to life. Even with the government spending unprecedented sums on aid, America was experiencing “wildly different pandemics,” Wright notes. Black people and Latinos contracted the virus at a rate three times greater than whites, partly reflecting the ways economic need could lead to greater exposure. Children from low-income households experienced a 60 percent drop in math learning. There was barely a change for those from better-off homes.

“The Plague Year” often digresses, but we are always pulled back to the larger story. So, for instance, the discussion of race in America after the killing of George Floyd points to structural inequalities that lie beneath the pandemic’s divergent affects across communities. There are some truly shocking examples of this. The Minneapolis police force joined with the county hospital in a yearslong study on a clinical trial of the sedative ketamine, which can cause heart stoppage, trying it out on crime suspects without their consent; African Americans accounted for a huge number of those enrolled. And Ebony Hilton, a young Black anesthesiologist, explains increasing infant mortality among Black people: “Should I have a child, it would actually be at more risk of dying than my mom’s child was.”

In an intriguing chapter on the origins of the virus — which includes mention of the increasingly discussed theory that the virus leaked from a laboratory — Wright observes that coronavirus is “a harbinger” of things to come. The threat of another new hazard setting upon a nation so flagrantly splintered is terrifying.

How will we remember the first year of this plague that goes on bringing ruin across the world? Wright tells us that history has mostly obliterated individual stories of those who died in our last big pandemic, the 1918 flu. In response, he tries to embed personal heartbreak into the broader narrative. Take Iris Meda. She was a recently retired nurse who grew up poor in Harlem — her first bed was an ironing board. Iris had plans for retirement: riding in a convertible for the first time, for one. But she never got the chance. She contracted Covid and her daughter, double-gloved and visored, held her as she died. In “The Plague Year,” Wright has laid a foundation for memorializing a terrible disaster, creating space for countless others like Iris’s daughter to keep asking what happened, and to grieve.",david frum plague year wright lays foundation memorializing terrible disaster says history mostly obliterated individual stories died last big pandemic 1918 flu,America,,TRV,147.2760009765625,145.214111328125,145.0115966796875,143.12327575683594,-1.400017405935424,-0.13945934495298395,-1.5375242957848625,-2.819689013953758

The broad strokes are familiar enough that most Americans have long since stopped clocking the astonishing continued growth of the crisis: Between 2015 and 2022 — less than a decade — deaths from overdoses doubled. Since the turn of the millennium, they have grown more than fivefold. In the year I was born, 1982, there were 6,299 deaths, as I wrote a few months ago; in 2022, the year I turned 40, there were 107,941. This was an absolute tsunami of drug mortality unlike anything this country, or any other, had ever seen. And it showed no sign of stopping — even when the number of Americans using opioids started trailing off, the mortality effect of that decline was swamped by the arrival of fentanyl, which is many times more deadly.

And then, in 2023, the trend began reversing. At first, the change was relatively small — slowing growth followed by gradual decline. But the data from recent months is far more positive — nearly a 17 percent drop in the 12-month running total. In many states, from Ohio and Virginia to Nebraska, Kansas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, declines are larger than 20 percent. In North Carolina, overdose deaths have dropped by more than 35 percent in a single year.

The second trend concerns obesity, now one of the leading behavioral causes of death in America and perhaps the clearest intuitive sign for many Americans that the country is in a state of profound ill health — physical, behavioral and even spiritual. In 1992, when Bill Clinton made a point of jogging to McDonald’s, the obesity rate for American adults had just crossed 20 percent. In 2016, when Trump secured office and would soon be serving mountains of McNuggets at the White House, it was approaching 40 percent, and growing steadily. But last fall, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced, the adult obesity rate had actually declined for the first time in many years. And if the turn is the result of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, as many theorize, it may mean we are entering a new era, in which the long, relentless climb in obesity mercifully reverses.

The third trend concerns crime. In 2024, the data analyst Jeff Asher has calculated, the country likely experienced the largest decline in murder rate in recorded history. The second largest decline had been the previous year, 2023, meaning that in each of the last two years the country’s most reliable measure of violent crime has improved at a faster rate than at any point during the spectacular decline of the 1990s and 2000s. These declines are measured against the sudden spike in murder in 2020, which means rates of improvement don’t tell the whole story. But Asher’s analysis suggests that while the national murder rate remains slightly above the 2010-14 trough, it is nevertheless lower than at any other point since 1963. Even if the trend slows down, it is quite possible that 2025 could break that 60-year record, and make this year the least murderous one recorded since 1960.

These are not all the same phenomenon, and the fact that each is unfolding at the same time represents a serendipitous social coincidence so unanticipated that The Atlantic’s Derek Thompson recently called it a “mysterious health wave.”",2015 202 less decade deaths overdoses doubled since turn millennium grown fivefold 2024 country likely experienced largest decline murder rate,North Carolina,,DUK,105.83047485351562,107.23745727539062,104.89910125732422,108.0598373413086,1.32946811759322,-2.1805403424117027,-0.8800618134621047,2.106541136547599

Like we knew — we knew it was coming. Today is kind of getting worse and worse. We had to get a refrigerated truck to store the bodies of patients who are dying. We are, right now, scrambling to try to get a few additional ventilators or even CPAP machines. If we could get CPAP machines, we could free up ventilators for patients who need them. You know, we now have these five vents. We probably — unless people die, I suspect we’ll be back to needing to beg for ventilators again in another day or two. There’s a mythical 100 vents out there which we haven’t seen. Leaders in various offices, from the president to the head of Health and Hospitals, saying things like, ‘We’re going to be fine. Everything’s fine.’ And from our perspective, everything is not fine. I don’t have the support that I need, and even just the materials that I need, physically, to take care of my patients. And it’s America, and we’re supposed to be a first-world country. On a regular day, my emergency department’s volume is pretty high. It’s about 200 people a day. Now we’re seeing 400 or more people a day. At first, we were trying to isolate patients with cough and fever and be more careful around them, but we weren’t necessarily being extra careful around all the other patients. And then we started to realize that patients who were coming in with no fever but abdominal pain actually had findings on their X-rays and chest CTs that were consistent with this coronavirus, Covid-19. So someone in a car accident gets brought in and we get a CT scan of them, and their lungs look like they have coronavirus. We were seeing a lot of patients who probably had Covid, but we didn’t realize. Ten residents and also many, many of our nurses and a few of the attending physicians got sick. The anxiety of this situation is really overwhelming. All of the doctors, it’s hard for us to get tested even if we want to, even if we have symptoms. We’re exposed over and over again. We don’t have the protective equipment that we should have. I put on one N95 mask in the morning. I need to have that N95 mask on for every patient I see. I don’t take it off all day. The N95 mask I wore today is also the N95 mask I wore on Friday. We’re always worried that we’ll be out of N95 masks. What’s a little bit scary now is the patients that we’re getting are much sicker. Many of the young people who are getting sick don’t smoke, they’re healthy, they have no co-morbidities. They’re just young, regular people between the ages of 30 and 50 who you would not expect to get this sick. So many people are saying it’s going to be OK, everything’s fine, we have what we need. And if this goes on for a month or two or three or five like it did in China, and we’re already this strained, we don’t have what we need. I don’t really care if I get in trouble for speaking to the media. I want people to know that this is bad. People are dying.

Two years later he landed a similar position at Doyle Dane Bernbach, which, under William Bernbach, who liberated art directors and copywriters to brainstorm freely together, was arguably the most creative shop in town in the 1950s.

After a year at Doyle Dane Bernbach, Mr. Lois joined two colleagues, Fred Papert and Julian Koenig, to form Papert Koenig Lois in 1960. With Mr. Lois as creative director, it became the first ad agency with an art director as a principal. It went public in 1962, raising its fortunes and starting a trend. By 1967 it was a major agency, with $40 million in billings and clients like Xerox, National Airlines and some Procter & Gamble products.

In 1962, Harold Hayes, the editor of Esquire, asked Mr. Lois how to improve the magazine’s covers, which were then conceived and assigned by an editorial committee. “Is that what you do when you assign a story to Talese or to Mailer — you have a group grope?” Mr. Lois recalled saying. “You need to get one guy who understands the culture, who likes comic strips, goes to the ballet, visits the Metropolitan Museum.”

Mr. Lois was hired for the job as a freelancer. His covers — photos or montages, sometimes with hand-drawn elements — were often textless, making their point strikingly with a single image. He was credited with 92 in all, though the origins of some were later disputed. Many were controversial — Sonny Liston’s Santa cost Esquire $750,000 in dropped advertising.

“We saw it long time, that one day this thing will burst,” said Memane Paulus, a machine operator at the dam for the past decade.

The worst fears of residents came true this month when a section of the dam crumbled, sending a thunderous rush of gray sludge through the community that killed at least one person, destroyed 164 houses, and turned a six-mile stretch of neighborhoods and grassy fields into an ashen wasteland.

The Jagersfontein disaster has caused alarm in a nation where heaping dams of mining waste, known as tailings, are part of the landscape.

You may remember that Stierli, the Modern’s chief curator of architecture and design, co-curated an exhibition a few years ago about postwar Yugoslavia called “Toward a Concrete Utopia.” One region at a time, he is retrieving great, underappreciated architects from that waiting room, unpacking a big-dream, blue-sky era, after World War II, when designers, planners and engineers from Brasília to Belgrade to New Bombay were suddenly tasked with constructing cities, societies and nation-states from scratch.

Alcohol flowed freely. She occasionally smelled it on the breath of male lawmakers when they voted.

Many men in Australian politics also thought nothing of belittling women, she said, or spreading sexual rumors. More than a few treated junior employees like playthings. Once, Ms. Banks said, a fellow lawmaker introduced a new intern while slowly rubbing his hand up and down the young woman’s back.

“I could see her visibly flinch,” Ms. Banks said. “She and I locked eyes, and I’m sure the nonverbal cue to me was ‘Don’t say anything, please don’t say anything, I’ll lose my job.’”

“It is the most unsafe workplace in the country,” she added.

It was not a helpful sound bite for his colleagues, but Mr. Roy had a point. After nearly 11 months in control, House Republicans had little to show for themselves beyond ousting their first speaker, Kevin McCarthy, and then making life miserable for his successor, Mike Johnson, who won the job only because exhausted Republicans saw him as a compromise who had yet to offend any of the party’s warring tribes.

As much as 40 percent of food served at restaurants never gets eaten, according to a 2020 study on food waste. In an effort to slow climate change, states including California and Massachusetts have restricted how much food can end up in landfills. And millions of people taking GLP-1 drugs are eating much less than they once did.

Then there’s what market researchers call “snackification.” Especially among younger people, traditional meals are being replaced with snacks and small assemblages of food that approximate meals. Millennials and Gen Z-ers in particular are snacking more as a way to manage schedules that vary widely day to day, to explore bolder flavors in a low-risk way and to create more nutritionally sound diets.

On average, U.S. adults describe half the occasions they eat in a day as snacks, according to data from the Hartman Group, a market research company.

For younger diners, value is a much more complex calculus than getting the largest portion for the lowest price, said Shelley Balanko, the group’s senior vice president. They care about whether a price is fair given the quality of the ingredients and cost of labor, and how much their food impacts the environment.

“When it comes to quantity,” she said, “it’s the right size for me or for my needs at the moment.”

Desperate to warn Mitsuha, he reaches out to her through Shinto-inflected magic. They meet briefly at twilight, when the boundaries between worlds become permeable in Japanese folklore. Like any awkward teenagers, they laugh, quarrel, shed tears and vow to be together again, but they also formulate a plan to save the people of Itomori.

She’s not a princess on a quest to preserve her realm like Moana, or Poppy in “Trolls 2.” She’s a frightened girl trying to save her family and friends from a deadly threat. She defies her pompous politician father, and uses her intelligence and resolve to overcome her fear and save hundreds of lives. But any capable high school girl could do what Mitsuha does: She doesn’t need superpowers to save the day.

But even if that happens, even if we have to move somewhere else, we go on living. We meet someone special. That’s what I wanted Mitsuha to do, who I wanted her to be.”

The trend toward complex heroines isn’t new in anime. Miyazaki’s Oscar-winning “Spirited Away” (released in Japan in 2001 and now on HBO Max) grew out of his dissatisfaction with the superficial entertainments offered to adolescent girls in Japan. “I wanted the main character to be a typical girl in whom a 10-year-old could recognize herself,” he explained through a translator in an interview. “She shouldn’t be someone extraordinary, but an everyday, real person — even though this kind of character is more difficult to create.

Bolstered by an enormous cash-on-hand advantage, a series of critical Republican recruitment failures and a wave of liberal enthusiasm, Democrats have fortified their grip on hard-fought seats won in 2018 that allowed them to seize control of the House. They have trained their firepower and huge campaign coffers on once-solid Republican footholds in affluent suburban districts, where many voters have become disillusioned with Mr. Trump.

That has left Republicans, who started the cycle hoping to retake the House by clawing back a number of the competitive districts they lost to Democrats in 2018, straining to meet a bleaker goal: limiting the reach of another Democratic sweep by winning largely rural, white working-class districts like this one in central New York where Mr. Trump is still popular. Depending on how successful those efforts are, Republican strategists, citing a national environment that has turned against them, privately forecast losing anywhere from a handful of seats to as many as 20.

That is starkly at odds with Mr. Trump’s own prediction just days ago that Republicans would win back control of the House, which Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared “delusional,” echoing the private assessments of many in the president’s own party.",democrats poised expand majority house republicans weighed president trumps low standing crucial battlegrounds,New York,,TRV,110.56475067138672,108.33597564697266,110.52837371826172,112.25680541992188,-2.015809750286763,2.023702706507473,-0.032901040253884524,1.530374498436821

But it’s rare for a novel to be quite as polarizing, or as controversial in the wider culture, as Jeanine Cummins’s new book, “American Dirt,” has turned out to be.

Essentially a narcothriller — it’s about a Mexican woman and her son fleeing to the border to escape a murderous drug lord — the book is already a huge hit. Oprah Winfrey recently picked it for her book club, and it enters this week’s best-seller list at No. 1. But it has also been widely condemned, on political grounds by readers who say it resorts to stereotypes and exploits current events to make a fetish out of trauma, and on aesthetic grounds by readers who say it’s just badly written. (That’s where The Times’s critic Parul Sehgal landed in her review.) In the wake of the outcry, the book’s publishers announced on Wednesday that they were canceling a planned author tour.

So why are we recommending it?

For one thing, “American Dirt” is clearly the book of the moment. It has spawned a galvanizing conversation — if not the one that Cummins might have been hoping for — and anybody who wants to follow along would probably do well to read the book at the center of the discourse. For another thing, both Lauren Groff (in the Book Review) and the editor who assigned it to her were genuinely impressed by the book’s propulsive momentum and topical concerns. You might be, too — or you might hate it! Either way, you’ll have something to talk about at your next book group.

Even past skeptics, largely Democrats, have come around to the idea — notably in California, where the state’s sole remaining nuclear plant, Diablo Canyon, is scheduled to close in 2025. The search for clean energy has given nuclear power a spark that has drawn bipartisan support that added billions in funding for existing and new projects.

But critics of the nuclear industry argue that a veneer of clean energy has not changed the concerns about the technology, including aging facilities in need of potentially costly improvements, the challenge of nuclear waste disposal and steep cost overruns for new projects that are years late — if they reach completion.

“The industry knows it does not have a good story to tell,” said Edwin Lyman, a physicist and the director of nuclear power safety with the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It’s still plagued by the same issues.”",states sole remaining nuclear power plant diablo canyon scheduled close 2025 state looking ways extend life plant,California,,PCG,-3.0,9.791279792785645,9.781328201293945,10.030091285705566,-3.0,-0.10163729055145268,-3.0,-3.0

Politically that may be true. But more than any of the other cases, this one is revealing of a trend ailing America today: how much we’ve lost our moorings as a society.

How so? The environment offers a good answer. Almost 30 years ago I visited the Atlantic Forest in Brazil with a team from Conservation International, and its members taught me about all the amazing functions that mangroves — those thickets of trees that often live underwater along tropical coastlines — perform in nature. Mangroves filter toxins and pollutants through their extensive roots, they provide buffers against giant waves set off by hurricanes and tsunamis, they create nurseries for young fish to safely mature because their cabled roots keep out large predators, and they literally help hold the shoreline in place.

To my mind, one of the saddest things that has happened to America in my lifetime is how much we’ve lost so many of our mangroves. They are endangered everywhere today — but not just in nature.

Our society itself has lost so many of its social, normative and political mangroves as well — all those things that used to filter toxic behaviors, buffer political extremism and nurture healthy communities and trusted institutions for young people to grow up in and which hold our society together.",lz granderson says loss manmade structures us major loss says crucial health nation economy,America,,TRV,-3.0,206.70669555664062,206.4119415283203,204.7808380126953,-3.0,-0.1425952979058415,-3.0,-3.0

We also reviewed the reports his hedge fund provided to investors to check for discrepancies between what he reported to the I.R.S. and the fund’s returns. He has told his investors that 95 percent of his net worth is invested in his funds.

According to the tax returns, from 2010 to present, the Weinsteins paid $86.3 million in federal taxes and $37.7 million in New York State and city taxes, for a total of $124 million. The couple’s adjusted gross income during the same period was $288.9 million; their taxable income was $246 million, lowered in part by $29.5 million in philanthropic gifts.

Mr. Weinstein appeared to come by his tax bill in a straightforward way: He lost money. Unlike many of the individuals ProPublica highlighted whose net worth went up but they reported no taxable income — like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk — Mr. Weinstein’s wealth was falling in the years he paid little or no tax. He also used a mark-to-market method for tax filing purposes known as a Section 475 election, which meant he paid taxes on both realized and unrealized gains.

Mr. Weinstein’s flagship fund was down 3.87 percent in 2012, 6.75 percent in 2013 and 10.81 percent in 2014. It eked out a 3.37 percent gain in 2015 and then a 22 percent increase in 2016. In 2017, his fund lost 8.9 percent, before posting an 11 percent gain in 2018. He lost 12.8 percent in 2019 and posted a whopping gain of 73 percent in 2020.

ProPublica’s reporting on the tax bills of the wealthiest Americans should incite an important debate in the country. DealBook has been particularly vocal about the need to reform the tax code. The American public might come to the conclusion that the rich should still pay taxes even in years when they genuinely lose money or simply become less wealthy. But that’s not the way the current system works, in reality or in spirit.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING

The big money behind the contest for New York City mayor. Billionaires have spent $16 million on super PACs related to the race, the first mayoral election in the city to feature those groups. Most of those donations — coming from the likes of Steve Cohen, Dan Loeb and Ken Griffin — have benefited three moderate Democratic candidates: Eric Adams, Andrew Yang and Ray McGuire. The primary campaigns end tomorrow.

Bill Ackman’s SPAC seals its deal for a piece of Universal Music Group. Pershing Square Tontine formally agreed to buy 10 percent of the music label from Vivendi for $4 billion, in a complex transaction that would see Universal go public — and also create two other Ackman-run investment vehicles. But the deal faces opposition from some Vivendi investors, who are set to vote on the spinoff tomorrow.

And the pace of testing remains stubbornly slow in California. New York State, with half the population, has conducted twice as many tests for the virus as the Golden State.

The wind theoretically shouldn’t be a factor, as we are hemmed in by buildings on all sides, but this tree, some 60 years old, has strained skyward in search of sunlight. With its canopy cresting the surrounding rooflines, its uppermost leaves catch the wind and everything below gently moves. The sensation is a bit unnerving and invokes one of the laws of treehouse building: Heights you wouldn’t think twice about in a concrete structure suddenly become imposing when you’re on a branch.

He’s designed and constructed about 250 of them, ranging from backyard follies to a monumental work in response to the 2011 tsunami to a jungle perch with views of Angkor Wat in Cambodia (created for a commercial for the Japanese lottery). He’s built treehouses for affluent Chinese clients and treehouses for preschools — draws for parents anxious about their children’s detachment from nature.

The most modest of his structures, he says, is four square feet; the largest, about 270 square feet.

Testing lines stretched for hours, and a quarantine hotel program doubled in size. Packed emergency rooms had too few nurses. Hospital morgues became so full that about 200 bodies had to be relocated by the city.

Like a tsunami, the Omicron variant of the virus swept through New York City from December to January, swamping defenses that had been built over the past two years. Some epidemiologists estimate that 40 percent or more of residents were infected. More than one in 10 public school students and about one in four school staff members had confirmed infections in the wave, according to state statistics.

The extraordinary surge exposed understaffing problems at the city’s hospitals, particularly among nurses, to a degree unseen earlier in the pandemic. For several weeks, tens of thousands of patients were treated by health care teams severely depleted by illness and burnout.

Yet now, with Omicron receding rapidly and virus cases plummeting more than 90 percent from their recent peak, health officials are also reaching an encouraging assessment: The city’s hospital system, although critically stretched, did not break.

The mental health toll of the Covid-19 pandemic has been the subject of extensive commentary in the United States, much of it focused on the sharp increase in demand for mental health services now swamping the nation’s health care capacities. The resulting difficulty in finding care has been invoked widely as justification for a variety of proposed solutions, such as digital health and teletherapy services provided by profit-driven start-ups and a proposed mental health plan that the Biden administration unveiled this year.

But are we really in a mental health crisis? A crisis that affects mental health is not the same thing as a crisis of mental health. To be sure, symptoms of crisis abound. But in order to come up with effective solutions, we first have to ask: a crisis of what?

Some social scientists have a term, “reification,” for the process by which the effects of a political arrangement of power and resources start to seem like objective, inevitable facts about the world. Reification swaps out a political problem for a scientific or technical one; it’s how, for example, the effects of unregulated tech oligopolies become “social media addiction,” how climate catastrophe caused by corporate greed becomes a “heat wave” — and, by the way, how the effect of struggles between labor and corporations combines with high energy prices to become “inflation.” Examples are not scarce.

For people in power, the reification sleight of hand is very useful because it conveniently abracadabras questions like “Who caused this thing?” and “Who benefits?” out of sight. Instead, these symptoms of political struggle and social crisis begin to seem like problems with clear, objective technical solutions — problems best solved by trained experts. In medicine, examples of reification are so abundant that sociologists have a special term for it: “medicalization,” or the process by which something gets framed as primarily a medical problem. Medicalization shifts the terms in which we try to figure out what caused a problem, and what can be done to fix it. Often, it puts the focus on the individual as a biological body, at the expense of factoring in systemic and infrastructural conditions.",mental health toll covid19 pandemic subject extensive commentary really mental health crisis crisis affects mental health thing crisis mental health,the United States,,TRV,156.3181915283203,153.14027404785156,149.43902587890625,145.49993896484375,-2.0329799426402677,-2.416900578216797,-4.400745416868361,-6.920661285616658

She landed in Washington as the first woman in the post in July 2019, less than a year after Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, was murdered and dismembered by Saudi agents.

By early 2021 she was navigating the switch from the warm embrace of the Trump White House to the hostility of President Biden, who as a candidate in 2019 called the kingdom a “pariah.”

In the five tumultuous years since her arrival, Saudi Arabia’s fortunes in Washington, and Princess Reema’s, have turned.

Super PACs have no such protections, and Republicans have been more reliant on super PACs this year because their candidates have had trouble fund-raising. So Democrats have been the ones chiefly benefiting from the mandated low pricing, and Republicans in many top races have been at the mercy of the exorbitant rates charged by television stations as the election nears.

The issue may seem arcane. But strategists in both parties say it has become hugely consequential in midterm elections that will determine which party controls Congress.

From Labor Day through early this week, Senate Republican super PACs and campaigns spent more than their opponents on the airwaves in key races in Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and New Hampshire, according to data from the media-tracking firm AdImpact. But when measured in rating points — a metric of how many people saw the ads — the Democratic ads were seen more times in each of those states, according to two Democratic officials tracking media purchases.

In other words, Democrats got more for less.

“One of the challenges we face in taking back the House is the eye-popping differences between what Democrat incumbents and Republican challengers are raising — and what that affords them in terms of different advertising rates,” said Dan Conston, who heads the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Republican leadership that has raised $220 million and is one of the nation’s biggest television spenders.

In the week when Vice President Kamala Harris started to spell out some of her economic policies, it was Donald Trump’s turn on Thursday to set out his fiscal agenda. It comes as slowdown concerns grow ahead of Friday’s jobs report.

Much of these cover familiar ground and again raise as many questions as they sought to answer about how he would govern if re-elected. Still, his remarks could be a prelude to what he’ll be grilled on at next week’s debate with Harris.

Trump sought to draw a sharp contrast with Harris on who would be better for the economy. “I call it America First. This is the policy that built this country, and this is the policy that will save our country,” he told an audience that included JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, Blackstone’s Steve Schwarzman and the hedge fund mogul John Paulson.

The answer is one of Washington’s open secrets. Mr. Carlson, a proud traitor to the elite political class, spends his time when he’s not denouncing the liberal media trading gossip with them. He’s the go-to guy for sometimes-unflattering stories about Donald J. Trump and for coverage of the internal politics of Fox News (not to mention stories about Mr. Carlson himself). I won’t talk here about any off-the-record conversations I may have had with him. But 16 other journalists (none from The Times; it would put my colleagues in a weird position if I asked them) told me on background that he has been, as three of them put it, “a great source.”

“In Trump’s Washington, Tucker Carlson is a primary supersecret source,” the media writer and Trump chronicler Michael Wolff writes in his forthcoming collection of essays, “Too Famous.” Mr. Wolff, who thanked Mr. Carlson in the acknowledgments of his 2018 book, “Fire and Fury,” explained, “I know this because I know what he has told me, and I can track his exquisite, too-good-not-to-be-true gossip through unsourced reports and as it often emerges into accepted wisdom.”

Mr. Carlson was particularly well positioned to be a source about the Trump administration. His Fox platform, where in May he had a nightly average of three million viewers, made him someone who mattered to Mr. Trump, a close follower of television ratings. He has a former reporter’s eye for detail and anecdote, and his observations can be detected in the lurid tales of Mr. Trump’s chaotic court and Fox’s own tumultuous internal politics.

A coming book by the Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender, “Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost,” includes a moment in which Mr. Carlson sends Mr. Trump’s calls to voice mail after the first presidential debate last fall, when he was criticized for repeatedly interrupting Joe Biden. When Mr. Trump finally reaches the Fox host, the book describes, verbatim, an exchange between the two men that casts Mr. Carlson in a flattering light. (“Everyone says I did a good job,” Mr. Trump tells Mr. Carlson. “I don’t know who told you that was good,” Mr. Carlson says. “It was not good.”) Mr. Bender declined to comment on the sourcing that allowed him to so precisely reconstruct a conversation between the two men.",tucker carlson proud traitor elite political class goto guy stories donald j trump fox news,Washington,,WY,28.292949676513672,29.01276397705078,28.902673721313477,28.91114044189453,2.5441472478729783,-0.3794545594635056,2.1550388056779535,2.184964001452373

At a tech workplace downtown, a gaggle of 20-somethings divide into teams, calling out “Who’s on the Orange team?” and “We’re going to kill it!” as part of a game night enticing them back to in-person work. On the subway, commuters delight in a once-unimaginable indulgence: bag-spreading across two seats.

About a year and a half after Mayor Eric Adams chided workers — “You can’t stay home in your pajamas all day!” — New York’s offices in late August were under 41 percent of their prepandemic occupancy. Just 9 percent of the city’s office workers were going in five days a week at the start of the year, according to the Partnership for New York City, a business group. Remote-work levels crisscrossing the country are more mixed, with just under one-third of America’s workdays now done from home.

There’s no point in pretending otherwise. And from the casual conversations all around me and the formal polling of voters, I know I’m in robust company.

There are tsunamis yet to come.

Even so, aspects of the subject actually get too little consideration, starting with this crushingly obvious and yet frequently overlooked fact: The presidency isn’t a solo mission. Not even close. It’s a team effort, and the administration that a president puts together matters much, much more than his brawn or his brio.

To listen to the fretting over how many hours a day Biden can vigorously work, how many speeches he can authoritatively deliver and how many miles he can comfortably travel is to get the sense that he’s independently on the hook for the nation’s welfare. That he’s more action figure than decision maker. That, um, he alone can fix it. That he shoulders all the responsibility.

To be unflinchingly precise, Barry Humphries, the Australian-born actor and comic who for almost seven decades brought that divine doyenne of divadom, Dame Edna Everage, to delirious, dotty, disdainful Dadaist life, died on Saturday in Sydney. He was 89.

His death was confirmed by the hospital where he had spent several days after undergoing hip surgery. In a tribute message posted on Twitter, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia praised Mr. Humphries as “a great wit, satirist, writer and an absolute one-of-kind.”

A stiletto-heeled, stiletto-tongued persona who might well have been the spawn of a ménage à quatre involving Oscar Wilde, Salvador Dalí, Auntie Mame and Miss Piggy, Dame Edna was not so much a character as a cultural phenomenon, a force of nature trafficking in wicked, sequined commentary on the nature of fame.

For generations after the day she first sprang to life on the Melbourne stage, Dame Edna reigned, bewigged, bejeweled and bejowled, as one of the longest-lived characters to be channeled by a single performer.

Macmillan submitted to a round of self-flagellating town halls with its staff. Cummins lay low, having become something of a pariah among her professional peers. Since publication, I have been told, not a single author in America has asked her to blurb a book.

Some calls for change that came out of the firestorm were well founded — in particular, the call to diversify a largely white and well-heeled industry. Publishing, an exciting but demanding and notoriously low-paying job, isn’t for everyone. But it should certainly be open to and populated by people of all backgrounds and tastes. Black editors interested in foreign policy and science fiction, Latino editors interested in emerging conservative voices or horror, graduates from small colleges in the South interested in Nordic literature in translation. People from all walks of life who are open to all kinds of stories from all kinds of authors can bring a breadth of ideas to a creative industry.

Yet in their assertion that the publisher somehow “made” this book succeed in ways they wouldn’t for another Latino author, the novel’s critics misunderstood several fundamentals about how publishing works. First, it is a business, and one in which most novels fail. If publishing were as monolithic and all-knowing as many critics seemed to presume, publishers would make every novel succeed. If all it took was throwing marketing muscle behind a novel and soliciting every over-the-top blurb possible, then publishing wouldn’t be such a low-margin business. When a book proposal comes along that generates huge excitement and the prospect of success, naturally publishers will jump on it, spend the money they need to win the contract and do everything they can to recoup their investment. For most authors, a six- or seven-figure advance is a shocking windfall; most books typically do not earn back the advance in sales. Publishing is full of authors and editors who believe in their books, only to be disappointed.

Many critics of “American Dirt” also made cynical assumptions about the author. In their view, Jeanine Cummins set out to profit off the tragedy of the border crisis. Tellingly, most didn’t consider that Cummins might have had any motivation beyond money.

Think about what could have been.

The response from other Latino writers and the larger literary world could have been yes to this book and to this author, who made an effort to explore lives other than her own, as well as, yes to a memoir by a Honduran migrant, for example, and yes to a reported border narrative by a Texan journalist and yes to a collection by a Mexican American poet. A single book, whether perfect or flawed — and negative reviews are entirely fair game — cannot be expected to represent an entire people, regardless of how it is written or marketed. Instead of shutting down this particular author in the name of a larger cause — its own form of injustice — the response from fellow Latino writers could have been more generous.",jeanine cumins become something pariah among professional peers since publication told single author america asked blurb book publishing exciting demanding notoriously,America,,TRV,182.3867950439453,183.69680786132812,180.4934844970703,174.75624084472656,0.7182607803745719,-1.7438100321677807,-1.0380743553385074,-4.183720755321239

Doctors poked and scanned but couldn’t figure out anything wrong. Over the years, they cut her open and removed bits and pieces yet couldn’t drive away the pain. So doctors prescribed opioids in increasing doses — even fentanyl patches — that left her addicted. At age 43, she now is off opioids but still suffers every single day, enduring chronic pain like an estimated 50 million other Americans.

Wert is part of a vast and mysterious panorama of pain that is increasing, sometimes with no obvious physical cause. And while chronic pain is a global problem, it is particularly puzzling in America. In other wealthy countries, it’s the elderly who report the most chronic pain, which makes some sense. But in the United States it’s the middle-aged — especially the jobless and people like Wert, who did not graduate from high school — who suffer the most. It is a plague on the less educated.

The book was inspired by and based on “A Course in Miracles,” by Helen Schucman, which Ms. Williamson credits with saving her from a rootless youth of cabaret singing and “bad boys and good dope,” as she writes in the book. (No more than what others of her age were doing, she is quick to clarify now.)

But though she began by writing about miracles and is now preparing to write a book about Jesus — “for people who do not necessarily relate to the dogma or the doctrine of the Christian religion” — she is very direct about one point. “I’m a Jew,” she said. “You’re born a Jew, you die a Jew.” Her spirituality is intended as ecumenical, and she has been building and refining it for decades. She sees her effort to branch out into politics — running for a California congressional seat in 2014, then for president in 2020 — as a natural extension of her earlier work.

“Spirituality isn’t some lane off to the side somewhere,” she said. “It’s an understanding of the dynamics that underlie everything. This isn’t a matter of ‘Wouldn’t it be nice if America decided to change?’ It’s a matter of ‘We must change, or we will lose it all.’”

Diagnosis: ‘Kooky’

One of Ms. Williamson’s top Google hits to this day is from The New Yorker’s Daily Shouts humor column, in which she is fictionally quoted as saying, “I’d like to reallocate the government money that we’re spending on vaccinating children to something useful, like taking mediums underwater to ask eldritch spirits, ‘Who are we? Why are we all here?’”

Ms. Williamson has never been easy to categorize, and she believes there are deeper reasons for her ridicule. “Those who were invested in calling me kooky didn’t do it because they thought what I was saying was silly,” Ms. Williamson said. “Making me appear ridiculous was the chosen way to marginalize my message.”

It was one week after her Brooklyn salon, and we were in the dining room of the Loews Regency Hotel on Park Avenue.

In addition, a 60-year-old man, who called himself only “James” in his contacts with The Times, but who subsequently identified himself publicly as James Grein, told the newspaper and Vatican investigators that Father McCarrick, a close family friend, had begun to abuse him in 1969, when he was 11 years old, and that the abuse had continued for almost two decades.

Many of the questions about how Cardinal McCarrick was able to avoid exposure for his crimes seemed to have been answered by a Washington Post investigation in late 2019, showing that starting in 2001, he had sent checks totaling more than $600,000 to some 100 powerful Catholic clerics, including Vatican officials, some of them directly involved in assessing misconduct claims against him. The checks were drawn from a special charity account of the Archdiocese of Washington, where he began serving as archbishop in 2001, The Post said.

In November 2020, the Vatican released a report detailing how the disgraced former prelate had risen through the church hierarchy despite longstanding allegations of sexual misconduct. The report, based on an investigation commissioned by Pope Francis, in which he largely absolved himself, put fault chiefly on his predecessors, Pope Benedict XVI, and in particular on Pope John Paul II. It said John Paul had ignored explicit warnings about sexual abuse by Mr. McCarrick, choosing to believe his denials and “misleading and inaccurate” accounts by several American bishops. Three of the four bishops, it said, found that Mr. McCarrick had shared a bed with seminarians and young adult men, but said they were not sure there had been sexual contact.

tsunami,Was the 401(k) a Mistake?,2024-05-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/magazine/401k-retirement-crisis.html,New York,"But even if the stock market delivers blockbuster returns over the next 15 years, her goal is going to be difficult to reach — and this assumes that she doesn’t have a catastrophic setback, like losing her job or suffering a debilitating illness.

She also knows that markets don’t always go up. During the 2008 global financial crisis, her 401(k) lost a third of its value, which was a scarring experience. From the extensive research that she has done, Forbus has become a fairly savvy investor; she’s familiar with all of the major funds and has 60 percent of her money in stocks and the rest in fixed income, which is generally the recommended ratio for people who are some years away from retiring. Still, Forbus would prefer that her retirement prospects weren’t so dependent on her own investing acumen. “It makes me very nervous,” she concedes. She and her friends speak with envy of the pensions that their parents and grandparents had. “I wish that were an option for us,” she says.

The sentiment is understandable. With pensions, otherwise known as defined-benefit plans, your employer invests on your behalf, and you are promised a fixed monthly income upon retirement. With 401(k)s, which are named after a section of the tax code, you choose from investment options that your company gives you, and there is no guarantee of what you will get back, only limits on what you can put in. This is why they are known as defined-contribution plans. Pensions still exist but mainly for unionized jobs. In the private sector, they have largely been replaced by 401(k)s, which came along in the early 1980s. Generally, contributions to 401(k)s are pretax dollars — you pay income tax when you withdraw the money — and these savings vehicles have been a bonanza for a lot of Americans.

Not all companies offer 401(k)s, however, and millions of private-sector employees lack access to workplace retirement plans. Availability is just one problem; contributing is another. Many people who have 401(k)s put little if any money into their accounts. With Americans now aging out of the work force in record numbers — according to the Alliance for Lifetime Income, a nonprofit founded by a group of financial-services companies, 4.1 million people will turn 65 this year, part of what the AARP and others have called the “silver tsunami” — the holes in the retirement system are becoming starkly apparent. U.S. Census Bureau data indicates that in 2017 49 percent of Americans ages 55 to 66 had “no personal retirement savings.”

The savings shortfall is no surprise to Teresa Ghilarducci, an economist at the New School in New York. She has long predicted that the shift to 401(k)s would leave vast numbers of Americans without enough money to retire on, reducing many of them to poverty or forcing them to continue working into their late 60s and beyond. That so many people still do not have 401(k)s or find themselves, like Jen Forbus, in such tenuous circumstances when they do, is proof that what she refers to as this “40-year experiment with do-it-yourself pensions” has been “an utter failure.”",jen forbus 60 percent money stocks rest fixed income friends speak envy pensions parents grandparents 401ks choose investment options,New York,,TRV,213.1917724609375,213.5553436279297,215.59910583496094,215.402587890625,0.1705371472807674,0.957017591932529,1.1291868097135531,1.0370078564324434

His shaggy blond hair fit the Venice artist stereotype, as did his predilection for wearing kilts and going shirtless. He tried busking and selling the paintings he made, but most of his income sources dried up once the pandemic hit. When he moved to Thatcher, he built a two-story structure out of plywood. It had a door with a lock. He hung his paintings on the outside and chatted with his housed neighbors as they walked by on their way to the bike path. “I never would have dreamed that I would be able to do this and have the freedom to just be this creative and show my art to as many people,” Tyrell said. “But I’ve got to figure out a way to get my credit cards back, because I’m basically bankrupt.”

By the end of the month, residents of the encampment were packing up. Gene Siegrist, the housed neighbor who spearheaded the landscaping at Thatcher, says he paid some of them $50 to leave. One unhoused man, who was rumored to be running a bicycle chop shop, told me that several security guards from the large apartment complex across the street had warned them they would be fined or arrested if anyone was still living on the street by nightfall. That was threat enough to move elsewhere.

But Tyrell dug in his heels. “I’ve been asked to leave and harassed ever since I got here,” he told me. “I got beat up on Monday, but thankfully it wasn’t bad enough that I had to go to the hospital.” He showed me scratches and bruises near his ribs. “I don’t have anywhere to go, so I’m just going to stay here,” he said. A week later neighbors planted more yucca and laid out more gravel. By Halloween, Tyrell’s refusal to leave had become a hot-button issue on the social-media platform Nextdoor. Siegrist posted several pictures of Tyrell’s structure. Another neighbor suggested reporting it to Bonin’s office. To that, Siegrist replied: “Don’t waste your time with that idiot. He caused this entire mess.”

One night in March, city workers fenced off the Echo Park Lake section in the Echo Park neighborhood, on the other side of Los Angeles, and forcibly relocated hundreds of unhoused people. The episode drew national attention and prompted widespread protests throughout the city. Some imagined that Los Angeles might finally do something about its homeless problem. But in Venice, others wondered if the same harsh tactics could be used to clear the encampments on Third Avenue, Hampton and the boardwalk, near the beach, where 250 or so unhoused residents were living.

On June 7, Venice Beach served as backdrop and example when the councilman Joe Buscaino chose the boardwalk as the place to kick off his campaign for the mayoral election in 2022. Ryavec stood behind him, along with 75 or so supporters. Some held signs. “Beaches and parks are sacred,” a few said. “Save us Joe,” said others. Just as Buscaino finished speaking, a teenager who camps on the boardwalk and goes by the single name Angel was detained by the police after she was seen with a knife. Someone in the crowd later told The Los Angeles Times that she said, “I’m going to start killing people.” But while she was being handcuffed, Angel explained that the knife was for protection and to slice fruit.

The suit was heard by Judge Raag Singhal, a Trump appointee who was no fan of the Sullivan decision or CNN. Yet Singhal dismissed Trump’s lawsuit, noting that CNN’s statements about Trump were opinions, not facts, and therefore were not defamatory.

Trump appealed last March. His lawyers disputed a number of Singhal’s conclusions, but they also made no secret of Trump’s backup plan if the appeal failed on the merits. “Plaintiff respectfully requests that the court revisit the actual-malice standard under New York Times v. Sullivan,” they wrote. “Recognizing this court cannot overrule Sullivan, Plaintiff makes this argument to preserve the issue in the event of further review.” The next stop, in other words, would be the Supreme Court.

The sense of Sullivan’s fragility is already influencing news outlets. After Trump won in November, ABC News had to decide what to do about a lawsuit that Trump filed against the broadcaster eight months earlier. The anchor George Stephanopoulos described a jury as having found Trump liable for raping the writer E. Jean Carroll, when in fact he had been found liable for the lesser offense of sexual abuse. The lawsuit claimed, implausibly, that Trump’s reputation was harmed by this imprecise description. The case was inching toward trial.

Executives at Disney, which owns ABC, reportedly worried about their prospects with a jury in Florida, whose voters backed Trump in each of the past three elections and presumably had little affection for the mainstream media that Trump and his allies constantly assailed. If ABC lost at trial, the network could appeal, but that set it up for protracted litigation with a president whose administration was preparing a crackdown on the media. Executives at Disney also expressed fear that the case might somehow make its way up to the Supreme Court and become a vehicle for overturning Sullivan. It felt safer to settle — a clear illustration of how the long-running campaign to delegitimize the press and weaken its First Amendment protections is already having a chilling effect on media decision makers. In December, Disney agreed to fork over $15 million to Trump for his future presidential foundation, as well as an additional $1 million to cover his legal fees.

The settlement seemed to embolden Trump. A couple of days later, he gave a news conference at Mar-a-Lago and was asked whether he planned to file more defamation lawsuits.

“Oh, I do, I do,” Trump replied. After listing some of the journalists and news outlets that he has sued, the president-elect added: “I feel I have to do this. I shouldn’t really be the one to do it — it should have been the Justice Department or somebody else — but I have to do it. It costs a lot of money to do it, but we have to straighten out the press. Our press is very corrupt. Almost as corrupt as our elections.”",donald trump filed defamation suit cn 202 judge dismissed suit saying cns statements opinions facts trump appealed decision case settled december,Florida,,ALCO,29.320919036865234,28.991470336914062,28.502288818359375,28.472339630126953,-1.1235960903440836,-1.6873291104929775,-2.7919664369203243,-2.8941091705596307
tsunami,The Invention of Elise Stefanik,2022-12-31,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/31/us/politics/elise-stefanik.html,California,"The Price of Loyalty

“What happened to the red wave, congresswoman?”

The day after her party’s midterm underperformance, even the normally friendly hosts on “Fox and Friends” had questions for Ms. Stefanik. In the weeks leading to Election Day, she had predicted nothing less than a “red tsunami.” But around the country, Mr. Trump’s handpicked candidates for the Senate and other offices went down to defeat; those he had endorsed in close House races ran significantly behind Republicans he had not, hampered in part by voters’ revulsion at the extreme rhetoric he had normalized in Republican circles. Fewer than a third of the female House candidates Ms. Stefanik had endorsed through her leadership PAC made it through the general election. Republicans will soon take control of the House with one of the slimmest margins in history; the party’s House leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, has already been forced to cut deals with the most extreme members of his caucus to keep his would-be speakership alive. Like the party more broadly, House Republicans cannot yet afford to banish those most responsible for their quandary.

But as other Republicans questioned how to wean their party off Mr. Trump, Ms. Stefanik issued her pre-emptive endorsement of his all-but-announced re-election campaign. In some respects, she had little choice: Ms. Stefanik is arguably more dependent on Mr. Trump’s patronage than any other Republican leader, and his team soon made clear that he expected such an endorsement from anyone he was supporting for a leadership job. Two weeks after her re-election as conference chair, when Mr. Trump dined at Mar-a-Lago with the rapper Kanye West and the young MAGA commentator Nick Fuentes — two guests with a history of antisemitic or racist statements — Ms. Stefanik said nothing. Nor did she have anything to say publicly when Mr. Trump, citing stories about how Twitter had handled moderation decisions during the 2020 election, suggested “termination” of the Constitution might be an appropriate remedy.

When Congress reconvenes, many of the younger, more Trump-critical Republicans who joined the House alongside Ms. Stefanik eight years ago will be gone. So will all but two of the Republicans who voted to impeach him. Some in Congress believe that if Mr. McCarthy cannot corral the votes to make himself speaker, Ms. Stefanik could offer herself up as a compromise candidate.

Yet her position may be more precarious than it appears. Unwilling to acknowledge that her politics have changed, she has never offered MAGA die-hards a persuasive conversion story, leaving behind lingering suspicion. “One thing I’ve heard consistently from pro-Trump members is that the 180 that she pulled was just so jarring,” said one veteran Republican lobbyist who is in touch with a wide array of Republican lawmakers.

Among her fellow Republicans, according to Republican lawmakers, Hill staff and lobbyists, Ms. Stefanik has a reputation for being both diligent in advancing the party’s message and unabashedly transactional in amassing chits of support for her own climb up the ladder. But her campaign donations and endorsements have given her support that may be more broad than deep. For much of the spring and summer, while serving as conference chair, she quietly tested the waters for promotion to the next highest-ranking House job, that of Republican whip. As the race grew more crowded, however, Ms. Stefanik found herself without a clear constituency for the position. The party’s remaining moderates no longer saw her as one of them, and its right wing preferred a more consistent conservative. Only when another House member announced his interest in succeeding her as conference chair did Ms. Stefanik finally commit to running for another term in her old job.

News stories about the upcoming presidential campaign still mention Ms. Stefanik as a rising star who might join a Trump ticket in 2024 — a political pole vault that would carry her, finally, to the very top of the Republican Party. But within the former president’s inner circle, according to two people close to Mr. Trump, stories casting Ms. Stefanik as a potential running mate are regarded as clumsy plants by her own team, and inspire bemusement and mockery. Mr. Trump liked her, they said, and liked watching her defend him. But even he didn’t trust her.

To the Editor:

Matthew Walther’s lament that poetry is dead because poets are no longer in touch with mysterious forces of the natural world raises once again questions that never fail to excite me: What is a poem? Is there a “right” poem and a “wrong” poem? Not really. Is there an aesthetically “good” poem and a “not so good” poem? Yes, but how different readers arrive at their assessments is as variable as the wind.

Mr. Walther implies that we are separate from “nature” and that perhaps poetry could be revived if we returned to a pre-technological sensibility. But what is “nature,” exactly, and where is “nature”? Outside the city, in mountains or sea?

What if “nature” is inside every one of us? Aren’t we as much “nature” as the bird and the tree?

Why Would Anyone Shut This Down?,2025-03-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/opinion/salmon-klamath-river-dam.html,"California, n’t, the United States, Oregon","But none of these depredations produced as much environmental damage as the undermining of the upper basin’s hydrology carried out by farmers, ranchers and their allies in the federal government. Early in the 20th century, they drained two of the Klamath’s three largest lakes and most of its wetlands to create agricultural fields. The loss of those two lakes and about 80 percent⁠ of the basin’s wetlands is the blow from which the upper basin can’t recover⁠.

It’s perhaps unjust to label the lake-drainers as villains, as they were merely mimicking what had already happened throughout much of the United States in the 19th century⁠, and they were oblivious to drainage’s long-term consequences. But over time it eliminated the upper basin water systems’ resilience.

Before Euro-Americans’ arrival, the upper basin was a unique watery landscape miraculously perched on top of sagebrush-dry terrain, in the 4,000-foot-altitude high desert of south-central Oregon and far northeastern California. Upper Klamath Lake, the lake that survives, was smaller than Tule Lake and Lower Klamath Lake, the two drained lakes. The three lakes, nestled close to one another at slightly different altitudes and interspersed with large tracts of wetlands, each had their own rhythm and composition: Tule Lake’s water level, for example, rose and fell over a 20-year cycle⁠, while Lower Klamath Lake fluctuated on a seasonal and yearly basis⁠.

The variations from lake to lake and from lake to wetlands fostered biodiversity. Two species of suckers are sacred to the Klamath Tribes of Oregon, the predominant upper basin tribe that is an agglomeration of three separate tribes required by the federal government in 1864; a juvenile sucker could grow up in relatively protected wetland waters, then circulate as an adult in more treacherous Upper Klamath Lake. But without the wetlands and two of the three lakes, the sucker population was vulnerable. By the 1990s, populations of the two sucker species had plummeted, and they are now on the verge of extinction.

To the farmers and ranchers of the early 20th century, the wetlands were useless quagmires, riddled with insects and inhospitable to humans — the word “wetlands” didn’t even come into common usage until the 1950s, when their invaluable ecosystem benefits began to be understood.",us drained two klamaths three largest lakes wetlands loss two lakes 80 percent basins wetlands blow upper basin,California,,PCG,16.19614601135254,16.375883102416992,16.755325317382812,16.85517692565918,1.1097522270944462,2.317079406299723,3.4525454737091272,4.069060095189923

They May Already Be Gone.,2025-01-31,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/dining/graber-california-olives.html,California,"Graber olives are grown in two orchards totaling 80 acres, about 200 miles north of the company’s headquarters. In good years, the company would produce 50 to 60 tons of olives, equal to more than 100,000 cans. But Graber yielded about half that total in 2022, its last canning season.

The company’s decline started more than a decade ago, when California farmers were bedeviled by the worst drought in state history, from 2011 to 2017. Tens of millions of trees of all species died during those years, and small companies like Graber had a particularly tough time surviving. The lack of water made the skins thicker and the olives harder to eat, and much of the crop from those years was used for oil.

“We had to buy extra water,” Ms. Graber said. “We had to pay three times as much on the ranch just to keep things alive. We just had to make tough choices.”

One of those tough choices shortly after the drought was selling the orchards to their longtime manager, Jay Zike, who had grown up adjacent to the property and started working there as a child. Mr. Zike agreed to keep growing the olives the same way they had been grown for more than a century and to keep selling them to the Grabers as long as they could afford them.

But a family squabble led to an expensive lawsuit, which was settled shortly before the pandemic shut down the Grabers’ shop and events business. Then lower olive yields forced the company to stop selling to brokers who had distributed Graber cans around the world.",companys decline started decade ago california farmers bedeviled worst drought state history lack water made skins thicker olives harder eat,California,,PCG,15.666926383972168,15.626985549926758,15.13770580291748,15.157676696777344,-0.2549372676332422,-3.130992509374724,-3.3779477102547655,-3.2504760328471645

“The ongoing and historic lack of rainfall, both in the city and in the upstate watershed where our reservoirs are located, has become more critical,” said Rohit T. Aggarwala, the city’s climate chief and the commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees the city’s water supply system.

The region, along with other parts of the United States, has experienced an unusually dry fall. Over a tenth of the southern section of New York State, including New York City, has been in a severe drought for about a week. In New Jersey, about a quarter of the state has been in an extreme drought for two weeks. New Jersey declared a drought warning last Wednesday. Both states, along with Connecticut, have announced burn bans, prohibiting residents from burning trash, brush or leaves.

New York and New Jersey are battling a wildfire along their shared border in the mountains that has proved difficult to contain and led to evacuations in a nearby town on Sunday. And New York City has seen a record number of brush fires — 270 and counting — this month. Several of them flared up in popular green spaces like Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Inwood Hill Park in northern Manhattan, prompting the Fire Department to announce the formation of a new brush-fire task force.

Although the rain predicted to fall in the city on Wednesday night and into Thursday will help mitigate the drought, it will not be enough to fix what has become a serious water deficit, said John Murray, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service.

The good news was summed up by one forecast: “Rain, finally.”

The bad news: It won’t be enough.

“Not a drought buster, but it will help,” the National Weather Service wrote on the X platform, predicting at least an inch of precipitation in the city. Some forecasts said there could be some wet snow tomorrow, which is expected to be a brisk and cold day.

Rain became a distant memory in New York as summer gave way to fall: More than 90 days went by without meaningful rainfall in the region. Since Oct. 1, the New York City area has received only about a quarter-inch. The city’s reservoirs, which would typically be close to 80 percent capacity at this time of the year, have receded to about 60 percent. In central New Jersey, a reservoir that serves over a million residents is more than half-empty.

Seen-it-all New Yorkers have had to adjust to the idea of wildfires, which have burned through green spaces from Brooklyn to Upper Manhattan and left a smoky haze on the skyline. From Nov. 1 to Nov. 14, the Fire Department dispatched firefighters to 271 brush fires, the most in any two weeks in the city’s history, according to City Hall. On Sunday, the department said it was setting up a brush fire task force that will send up drones for “pre-fire surveillance” to identify potential fires and provide tactical support to track where fires are spreading to keep firefighters safe.

The city has not imposed mandatory limitations on water use yet. “We’re hoping we won’t have to declare an emergency” — the next and highest level in the city’s three-step system — “because that’s going to come with a great deal of restrictions,” Mayor Eric Adams said during a television interview on Tuesday.",90 days went without meaningful rainfall new york city area citys reservoirs would typically close 80 percent capacity receded 60 percent,New York,,TRV,255.07447814941406,258.6647033691406,260.3110656738281,263.8516845703125,1.4075203625913248,0.6364851033957946,2.0529641234222757,3.4410367060545526

This natural transition could worsen drought conditions across the southern half of the country. But in the Northeast, Dr. Cook said, it’s a tossup whether the coming months will continue to be warm and dry, or if a lot of rain and snow will fall.

“With precipitation on the uptick and temperatures, because of the time of year, heading downward, it does look like we’re going to be in a good trajectory,” Mr. Tinker said. “But it’s been pretty dry and warm for quite a while, so we won’t pop out immediately.”

In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams encouraged residents to water their lawns less frequently and not let the water run when they brush their teeth. The city offered other tips in a news release, including not flushing the toilet unnecessarily, taking shorter showers and fixing leaks.

“In general climate change is making all weather patterns more extreme,” said Dr. Aggarwala. While the Northeast is likely to get wetter, “we’re also at a great likelihood of shorter, more extreme droughts like the one we may be in right now,” he said.

While personal actions matter, Dr. Fleishman said, larger-scale adaptations around infrastructure, agriculture and water policy have greater effects on water use.

The two largest fires this summer and fall were in New Jersey, the fastest-warming state in the Northeast and the one facing the most extreme drought conditions.

New York City has had more than 270 brush fires this month alone, the most in the city’s history. In response, city officials announced its first-ever Brush Fire Task Force this week. The blazes have caused no serious injuries or property damage. Still, it has been startling to residents of a city unaccustomed to wildfires to see Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Inwood Hill Park in Manhattan on fire.

The two-acre fire in Prospect Park harmed numerous trees and destroyed various native species. “It was devastating to see this treasured woodland almost destroyed,” Morgan Monaco, the president of the Prospect Park Alliance, a nonprofit, said. It was yet another sign of climate change: A little over a year ago, sudden flooding turned much of the park’s central lawn into something akin to the Colorado River, Ms. Monaco said.

In New Jersey, the Forest Fire Service has responded to more than 530 fires since early October, more than 10 times the number in the same period last year. Bone-dry conditions in the state, which has seen more fires than neighboring New York or Connecticut, have allowed one blaze in Tabernacle, a township east of Philadelphia, to burn continually since July 4, feeding off tree roots underground.

“We have never experienced conditions like this,” said Bill Donnelly, chief of the fire service.

Each state has declared a burn ban that prohibits people from starting bonfires and burning refuse, tires or trash.

The conditions are part of a dry spell across the United States: As of Nov. 12, nearly half of the country, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, was experiencing a drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.

The Answer: No.,2023-02-16,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/climate/argentina-drought.html,"Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil","In the last three months of 2022, however, the drought became especially severe. Rainfall totals in central Argentina were the lowest in more than half a century, and yields of wheat, soybeans and other crops fell dramatically in prime growing regions there and in Uruguay. Water emergencies were declared in some areas.

Like previous studies by the group, this one used observational data and computer models to compare what occurred late last year with what would have likely occurred in a world that had not warmed by 1.2 degrees Celsius, or 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit, as a result of human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. The work has not yet been peer reviewed, but the techniques the researchers used have been peer reviewed in previous studies.

The analysis looked at rainfall totals for October to December over most of Argentina, all of Uruguay and a small part of southern Brazil. They found that without climate change there was a 5 percent chance that such a period of sharply lower rainfall would occur in any given year.

But climate change did not increase the chances, they found. If anything, climate models show that region of central South America becoming slightly wetter as warming continues, though the researchers said the effect was insignificant and, as appeared to be the case with this drought, could be overwhelmed by natural variability.

The area also experienced record-setting heat waves last November and December. Extreme heat can make droughts worse by increasing the loss of moisture from soil and plants, said Juan Rivera, a researcher at the Argentine Institute for Snow Research, Glaciology and Environmental Sciences, who worked on the study.",rainfall totals central argentina lowest half century water emergencies declared areas area also experienced recordseting heat waves last november december,Argentina,,YPF,11.880000114440918,11.890000343322754,11.40999984741211,11.880000114440918,0.08417700997898143,-4.037009941553161,-3.956231165835533,0.0

The drought, which began in 2000 and has reduced water supplies, devastated farmers and ranchers and helped fuel wildfires across the region, had previously been considered the worst in 500 years, according to the researchers.

But exceptional conditions in the summer of 2021, when about two-thirds of the West was in extreme drought, “really pushed it over the top,” said A.

The government has come under pressure from the Biden White House, which is seeking to get all major carbon emitters to commit to ambitious climate change mitigation goals.

Environmentalists in Brazil say the government has weakened its environmental protection agencies in recent years by failing to hire enough personnel, by reducing the number of fines issued for environmental crimes and by supporting industries that are vying for greater access to protected biomes.

Instead of rebuilding the abilities of environmental protection agencies, the Bolsonaro administration outsourced that work to the military, deploying troops to the Amazon in 2019 and 2020. Last week, Vice President Hamilton Mourão announced that the government was starting a new military operation to prevent both illegal deforestation and fires. The initiative is expected to kick off this month and last two months.

The government has promoted the military operations, particularly to international stakeholders, as evidence of its commitment to fight illegal deforestation. But experts say those operations have failed to get to the roots of the problem and have done little to upend the impunity with which miners and loggers operate in protected areas.

Argemiro Leite-Filho, an environmental scientist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, said the link between deforestation and precipitation had become increasingly clear in recent years, compounding the effects of large-scale climate phenomena, such as La Niña.

Record-low precipitation and much-higher-than-normal temperatures over the past year have both contributed to the extreme dryness.

It is the most severe measure taken by the state since a drought emergency was declared for most of California in May.

The unanimous vote by the State Water Resources Control Board on Tuesday will come into force in about two weeks, when thousands of farmers in the watershed of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers — the lifeblood of the agricultural Central Valley — would be subject to drawing restrictions. Depending on a farmer’s rights and status, the amount of water that can be drawn could be reduced or cut altogether.

A separate curtailment order was passed for the Russian River north of San Francisco.

It is the fourth time in recent decades that California has curtailed water rights for farmers, and experts say climate change is likely to make similar restrictions more regular.

Severe deluges have occurred frequently in Britain in the past decade and a half, with particularly dramatic floods in 2000, 2007 and 2012.

“What we saw in 2012, after a severe drought, was a lot of flooding and quicker runoff into rivers,” said Ms. Coxon. “If we see significant amounts of rainfall in the autumn, falling on very dry and compacted soils, that will certainly lead to an increased risk of flooding.”

“Water companies are already managing the unprecedented effects of the driest winter and spring since the 1970s, and with more hot, dry weather forecast, it’s crucial we be even more mindful of our water use to minimize spikes in demand and ensure there’s enough to go around,” Peter Jenkins, director of communications for the industry body Water UK, said in a statement.

California has long cycled through spells of deluge and drought, in part because of natural climate variability. But research suggests that a warmer climate has supercharged the “whiplash” between these extremes.

Second, even an extremely wet winter isn’t a magic bullet for the long-term water concerns in the state, which have been exacerbated by years of extreme aridity, rising temperatures and unsustainable water use.

California’s groundwater aquifers have huge potential for storing water; they can hold eight to 12 times as much as all of the state’s major reservoirs combined. But, they have been badly depleted by decades of heavy pumping, especially in the agriculture-heavy Central Valley. Data suggests that groundwater supplies in the region decline precipitously during dry periods, recovering only modestly during wet ones.

When it comes to replenishing those aquifers, the state has had trouble capturing water from downpours and redirecting it to fields and sandy basins where it can seep underground, experts say. That means we still have a long way to go in restoring our groundwater supplies.

Heavy influxes of rain and snow during the winter can also have destructive repercussions later in the year.

Chamberland, Albuquerque, N.M

The idea of taking water from one community and giving it to another has some basis in American history. In 1913, Los Angeles opened an aqueduct to carry water from Owens Valley, 230 miles north of the city, to sustain its growth.

But the project, in addition to costing some $23 million at the time, greatly upset Owens Valley residents, who so resented losing their water that they took to dynamiting the aqueduct. Repeatedly.

Today, there are some enormous water projects in the United States, though building a pipeline that spanned a significant stretch of the country would be astronomically more difficult. The distance between Albuquerque, for example, and the Mississippi River — perhaps the closest hypothetical starting point for such a pipeline — is about 1,000 miles, crossing at least three states along the way.

As the state’s residents are discovering, the two opposite meteorological conditions can combine to make for severe mudslides.

In a prolonged drought, soils dry out, harden and become less permeable to water, said Dan Shugar, a geoscientist at the University of Calgary in Canada. When heavy rain falls on soil like that, less of the water soaks in.

“Any gardener who has forgotten to water their flower patch during a heat wave has firsthand experience of this,” Dr. Shugar said.

Water can pond quickly on the hardened soil, and, depending on the terrain, will eventually run off. On steep slopes, the water rushing downhill can accelerate, eroding soil in its path, picking up rocks and debris and joining with other rivulets of water to make a growing and potentially destructive mudslide.",prolonged drought soils dry harden become less permeable water heavy rain falls soil like less water soaks steep slopes water rushing downhill accelerate,Canada,,IFC.TO,188.7251434326172,189.99374389648438,187.89532470703125,189.77435302734375,0.672194727630519,-1.1044675189917945,-0.4396969637923299,0.5559458457114245

If Monday night was celebrated in some quarters as a moment of Southeastern Conference supremacy — Georgia became the conference’s third different team to win in the last three seasons — the field goal fest may well have been another reason for those outside the South to begin clicking off their TV sets well before the confetti landed.

This season’s semifinals were the second- and third-lowest rated broadcasts in the playoff’s eight seasons and if it is due in part to SEC fatigue, there may be more of the same to come.

One result of that multiplier effect for Australia — a global bellwether for climate change’s effects — is that rebuilding after a disaster becomes far more complicated. Many Australians in disaster zones complain that their government, after dismissing climate change for years, has yet to outline recovery plans that are clear and that take future threats into account.

At the same time, the economic costs of a changing climate are skyrocketing. Philip Lowe, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, warned recently that Australia was already paying a price, and that it would only go up.

The Mississippi typically nears its lowest levels in the fall, but the drop has been more intense this year after a particularly dry summer in the Midwest, which failed to replenish the tributaries feeding into the river. Its withered state has also allowed saltwater to push in from the Gulf of Mexico, threatening the drinking water supply for Louisiana communities that draw from the river.

Last month, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers installed a barrier made of sediment that stretches across the riverbed and serves as a speed bump of sorts, stalling the intrusion of saltwater that, under normal conditions, would be impeded by the river’s downstream flow. The corps is also dredging to prevent more barges from becoming stuck. In addition, the authority that manages the Tennessee River system announced that it would open two dams, although experts said it would provide only a modest influx into the Mississippi.

The biggest source of relief would be rain. Yet forecasters warned that weather conditions in the coming weeks and months are not likely to be favorable.

And the culturally omnivorous cooking that today spills from the state’s most acclaimed kitchens — all those zhugs and pastrami-jeweled breakfast burritos — is a celebration of California’s bounty and of culinary borrowings.

California’s agricultural sector explicitly positions itself as the guardian of this maximalism. Californian farms feed not only Californians. They supply a good portion of the rest of the country and world, too. California is America’s top producer of almonds, artichokes, carrots, garlic, onions, lettuce, grapes, pistachios and peppers, among other crops. In total, the state’s farmers and ranchers received $55.9 billion for their activities in 2022.

Agriculture is also the thirstiest sector of the state’s economy, accounting for around 80 percent of water used for businesses and homes. And while a significant portion goes to crops such as alfalfa that are used to feed animals, many of the fruits, vegetable and tree nut crops that California farmers plant also require a lot of water. As you might have heard, almonds and pistachios are among the worst offenders, requiring an average of four feet in depth of water per acre of irrigated land. But they’re not alone; apricots, pears, plums and walnuts require more than three feet, on average.

Policies that regulate groundwater use have a significant role to play, but chefs have a unique cultural power to mold consumption habits, and they can help push farmers to switch to less thirsty crops. Restaurants have driven the postwar expansion of popular taste: The kiwis, kales, radishes and radicchios now commonplace in American supermarkets were once highly exotic and difficult to find, but they became popular in part thanks to chefs who opened the public’s eyes to the possibilities of a more adventurous produce basket. Farmers will always respond to the market, but demand follows fashion — and this is where chefs can exert influence.",california americas top producer almonds artichokes carrots garlic onions lettuce grapes pistachios peppers among crops farmtotable movement locavorism,America,,TRV,211.24630737304688,217.65489196777344,213.72483825683594,206.74349975585938,3.033702541086046,-1.8056353686364164,1.1732895663885583,-2.131543823502601

An analysis by The New York Times using satellite images identified about 1,900 structures that appear visibly damaged or destroyed by wildfires in Lahaina, a historic tourist town on the island of Maui in Hawaii.

Wind-fueled wildfires that tore through the island on Tuesday and Wednesday have claimed at least 89 lives, forced the evacuation of thousands and decimated Lahaina.

While the fires were largely contained by Thursday morning, firefighters have continued to battle flare-ups, and emergency workers are still searching for survivors amid smoky and ashy conditions.

Tourists flock to Hawaii in large part for its tropical landscape and lush forests, but the state has also become increasingly vulnerable to wildfires. The area burned annually by wildfires in Hawaii has quadrupled in recent decades.

Invasive grasses that are highly flammable have taken over native vegetation in some areas, and climate change has exacerbated dry and hot conditions that have allowed many wildfires to spread more quickly.

Worsening drought conditions in recent weeks most likely contributed to the latest blaze. Nearly 16 percent of Maui County was in a severe drought on Tuesday, an uptick from about 5 percent the week before, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.

The explanation is as straightforward as it is sobering: As the planet heats up, no place is protected from disasters.

The story of this week’s blaze arguably began decades ago, when Hawaii started experiencing a long-term decline in average annual rainfall. Since 1990, rainfall at selected monitoring sites has been 31 percent lower in the wet season, and 6 percent lower in the dry season, according to work published in 2015 by researchers at the University of Hawaii and the University of Colorado.

Joaquin Esquivel, the chair of the water resources board. He added that “these regulations ensure that the water produced is not only safe, but purer than many drinking water sources we now rely on.”

More than 39 million people live in California, and the demand for water to sustain them — and the nation’s largest agriculture industry — has shaped the state’s history. Although violent winter storms saturated much of the state during the past year, California had been suffering from an extreme drought that scientists said included the driest three-year period on record. The push to exploit every drop in the state’s aquifers, rivers and reservoirs has only escalated under the pressures of climate change.

Water regulators spent more than a decade developing the rules on wastewater recycling, but they had faced a Dec. 31 deadline under a state legislative mandate. The vote, which was unanimous, followed years of review, including an evaluation by a dozen outside scientists and engineers.

The newly permitted system allows recycled wastewater to be brought up to drinking standards in a matter of hours and pumped directly back into pipes that supply homes, schools and businesses with drinking water, according to state officials. The new rules do not require water agencies to adopt direct potable use, but will allow those willing to invest in the necessary infrastructure to submit plans for state approval after the regulations are finalized next year.

Mr. Esquivel observed on Tuesday that residents who live downstream from larger cities already rely on some water that has been treated and returned to rivers. And Felicia Marcus, a longtime water policy expert in California and Mr. Esquivel’s predecessor as board chair, noted that water-scarce places, such as in Africa and on the International Space Station, already recycle their wastewater.

Worst in 12 Centuries, Study Finds.” by Henry Fountain:

Tree rings are a year-by-year measure of growth — wider in wet years, thinner in dry ones. Using observational climate data over the last century, researchers have been able to closely link tree ring width to moisture content in the soil, which is a common measure of drought. Then they have applied that width-moisture relationship to data from much older trees. The result “is an almost perfect record of soil moisture” over 12 centuries in the Southwest, Dr. Williams said. Using that record, the researchers determined that last summer was the second driest in the last 300 years, with only 2002, in the early years of the current drought, being drier. Monsoon rains in the desert Southwest last summer had offered hope that the drought might come to an end, as did heavy rain and snow in California from the fall into December.

It’s the latest evidence of how climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels is imperiling food, water and electricity supplies around the world.

The main driver of this year’s droughts was searing heat throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere, the researchers reported in a new study. Such high average temperatures, over such a large area, would have been “virtually impossible” without the influence of greenhouse gas emissions, the scientists said.

Across the Northern Hemisphere north of the tropics, soil conditions as parched as they were this summer now have a roughly 1-in-20 chance of occurring each year, the scientists found. Global warming increased this likelihood, they said, but cautioned that because of the challenges involved in estimating soil moisture at a global scale, the exact size of the increase had a wide possible range.

“In many of these countries and regions, we are clearly, according to the science, already seeing the fingerprints of climate change,” said Maarten van Aalst, the director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center and one of 21 researchers who prepared the new study as part of the World Weather Attribution initiative, a research collaboration that specializes in rapid analysis of extreme weather events.",main driver years droughts searing heat throughout much northern hemisphere high average temperatures large area would virtually impossible without greenhouse gas,China,,0700.HK,246.6513214111328,260.8632507324219,259.7412109375,230.19541931152344,5.7619514219426335,-0.43012566613792497,5.307042123868534,-6.671726713427867

That was followed by a total reversal in 2017, the state’s second-wettest year on record, which caused landslides, evacuations and $1 billion in damages to roads and highways.

Sound familiar? Six years later, Californians have lived through yet another cycle of lengthy drought followed by record-breaking destructive rains. Dozens of atmospheric rivers over the winter removed all of the state from drought conditions.

The transformation from drought to deluge and back again can feel so complete that it’s easy to forget what conditions were like just a few years before, or how long we’ve been lurching between the two. That’s been true for generations, as John Steinbeck observed in “East of Eden”: “During the dry years the people forgot about the rich years, and during the wet years they lost all memory of the dry years. It was always that way.”

Wildfires have killed more than 120 people as they swept the forested hillsides of Chile, and record-breaking rains have swelled rivers and triggered mudslides in Southern California.

Behind these risks are two powerful forces: Climate change, which can intensify both rain and drought, and the natural weather phenomenon known as El Niño, which can also supersize extreme weather.

In California, meteorologists had been warning for days that an unusually strong storm, known as an atmospheric river, was gathering force because of extraordinarily high Pacific Ocean temperatures. The rains began over the weekend and several counties were under a state of emergency. By Monday, officials warned that the Los Angeles area could be deluged by the equivalent of a year’s rainfall in a single day.

In the southern hemisphere, Chile has been reeling from drought for the better part of a decade. That set the stage for a hellish weekend, when, amid a severe heat wave, wildfires broke out.

And one of the simplest solutions — collecting and storing rainfall — is far more complicated than it seems.

Much of California’s water infrastructure hinges on storing precipitation during the late fall and winter for use during the dry spring and summer. The state’s groundwater aquifers can hold vast quantities of water — far more than its major reservoirs.

But those aquifers have been significantly depleted in recent decades, especially in the Central Valley, where farmers have increasingly pumped out water for their crops. And as Raymond Zhong, a New York Times climate journalist, recently reported, the state’s strict regulations surrounding water rights limit the diversion of floodwaters for storage as groundwater, even during fierce storms like the atmospheric rivers this winter.

I talked to Raymond to learn more about the potential of California’s groundwater, and its limitations. Here’s our conversation, edited for clarity and length:

How did this story come about?

I did a big story last year on flood risk in California and how climate change was increasing the risk of really strong storms. It was during the drought, and nobody in California was really thinking about the opposite problem, but they are two sides of the same hydrological equation. With climate change, you get both stronger storms and potentially longer and more intense droughts.

The early-season heat wave that broiled parts of Algeria, Morocco, Portugal and Spain last week almost certainly would not have occurred without human-induced climate change, an international team of scientists said in an analysis issued Friday.

A mass of hot, dry air from the Sahara parked itself above the western Mediterranean for several days in late April, unleashing temperatures that are more typical of July or August in the region. Mainland Spain set an April record of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit, or 38.8 Celsius, in the southern city of Córdoba. In Morocco, the mercury climbed to more than 106 degrees Fahrenheit in Marrakesh, according to provisional data, very likely smashing that nation’s April record as well.

A three-day stretch of such scorching heat in April is already quite rare for the region in the planet’s current climate, with just a 0.25 percent chance of occurring in any given year, according to the new analysis. But it would have been “almost impossible” in a world that hadn’t been warmed by decades of carbon emissions, said Sjoukje Philip, a climate scientist at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and an author of the analysis.

Only this time, they’re of the opposite kind.

It started with winter storms that drenched cities and towns, buried the Sierra Nevada in snow and caused an enormous long-vanished lake to reappear in the Central Valley. And it is poised to pass another milestone this weekend, as Hurricane Hilary lashes Southern California and its bone-dry inland deserts, which normally receive only a scant few inches of rain a year.

The latest — an aerial survey of the state’s most forested regions — shows that a combination of drought and insect damage wiped out a startling 36 million trees between 2021 and 2022.

“These last three years have been the hardest, driest three years on record in California,” said Jeffrey Moore, a forester with the U.S. Forest Service and the lead researcher on the survey, which was conducted from July to October. “When you get talking about multiyear exceptional drought, I mean, it’s rough on everything.”

The death toll wasn’t the highest we’ve seen in recent years, but it was troubling because of the type of trees that died and where they were. There are perhaps 40 species of native evergreen trees in California, but more than three-quarters of the dead trees detected last year came from one family: firs.

These Christmas-tree-looking conifers are found mostly at higher elevations where there’s more snow.

Wildfires can have a global climate impact as well, because burning vegetation releases planet-warming carbon dioxide. And from June through August, California fires emitted twice as much CO2 as during the same period last year, and far more than any other summer in nearly two decades.

After three years of drought, billions of gallons of water were suddenly gushing down the rivers. Yet, irrigation districts that wanted to grab some were still finding it difficult. The reason, I learned, was the state’s water rights system: Even when there’s far too much to go around, the system sets limits.

At first, I imagined that this meant regulators had a big spreadsheet that recorded everybody’s allotments in an orderly way: Here’s your name, here’s your place in line, here’s how much you can take and when. I soon found out that this wasn’t exactly the case: Yes, everybody has allotments. But the way they’re spelled out and enforced can be the opposite of orderly.

What did you learn from your reporting?

One of the big issues is that California really has two water rights systems. The state water board began issuing permits and licenses in 1914. That’s one system. But a lot of major farms and irrigation districts staked their claims to water before 1914, and the board has much more limited authority to regulate those. So essentially, in the same river basin, with everybody sharing the same supplies, the state has jurisdiction over some users but not others.

For this reason and more, it is “shockingly difficult” for the water board to manage supplies by cutting people off during a drought, as Erik Ekdahl, the board official responsible for the cutting, puts it.

How has such a haphazard system persisted for so long in a state with so many water needs?

For most of California’s history, you could probably say the system basically worked. Sure, there were droughts. People would fight over water sometimes. But the problems were infrequent and isolated enough that the system didn’t need major fixes.",california two water rights systems state water board began issuing permits licenses 1914 lot major farms irrigation districts staked claims water 1914,California,,PCG,17.532760620117188,17.274045944213867,17.373550415039062,17.990564346313477,-1.4756071876465915,0.5760345384430648,-0.9080726562561193,2.611133158750839

The water district has a little more than half of the water it needs to make it through the rest of the year. California relies on snow and rain at the beginning of the year to satisfy most of its water needs, and this year, the first three months were the driest on record. Next comes a hot, dry summer, made hotter and drier by anthropogenic climate change.

Last week, for the first time in its history, district officials in the Los Angeles area issued an emergency water shortage order. The goal is to reduce consumption by about 35 percent, which is far more than what the water district had to do during the last crippling year of drought in 2015. Upadhyay said if the once-weekly outdoor watering rules aren’t enough to reduce water use, the district could ban all outdoor watering by September. The rule could affect 6 million people in Southern California.

These disappointing numbers represent a marked change from late 2021. In December, Californians reduced residential water usage by more than 15 percent, exceeding Gov. Gavin Newsom’s conservation target. October and November saw significant savings as well.

So why the backslide?

Well, California is in the midst of a brutal drought that has depleted our reservoirs and snowpacks. Newsom has asked people and businesses to voluntarily cut how much water they use by 15 percent.

Climate change is causing rising temperatures and longer droughts, which together have made wildfires more frequent and devastating. This year’s wildfires, including the Palisades fire near Los Angeles, are expected to be even worse than usual, because much of the West has been stuck in an unusually bad drought.

As that risk grows, the Agriculture Department, which oversees the U.S. Forest Service, said it must double or even quadruple the amount of vegetation it removes from its forests each year. That leaves less fuel for fires that do ignite, making them easier to contain.

The amount of vegetation being removed each year “is not enough to keep pace with the scale and scope of the wildfire problem,” the department wrote. It called for treating an additional 20 million acres on National Forest System land by 2040, as well as 30 million acres on other federal, state, tribal and private land.",climate change causing rising temperatures longer droughts years wildfires expected even worse usual agriculture department says must double even quadruple amount vegetation removes,Los Angeles,,TRV,144.51455688476562,146.1806182861328,146.42910766601562,146.9998321533203,1.1528675292522172,0.16998791139083932,1.3248151760771356,1.7197404345476557

If Donald Trump retakes the White House, he is likely to roll back regulations aimed at limiting planet-warming emissions, expand fossil fuel production and eliminate federal incentives for clean energy and electric vehicles. Those decisions could usher in a new boom in oil and gas production that could lock in years of additional emissions.

In a Times article last week that analyzed Trump’s environmental record, Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, put it starkly: “Trump’s the worst president for the environment in American history. A second term will be brutal. He is going to go full throttle on having the trophy of shutting down the green movement and replacing it with an older-style gasoline and coal-fired America.”

If Vice President Kamala Harris wins, she is likely to continue President Biden’s effort to expand renewable energy and reduce emissions. But her approach to the fossil fuel industry is not entirely clear, as Lisa Friedman explained in an article detailing the climate stakes of this election.

The intermittent phenomenon — which occurs when sea-surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean are below average — typically brings drier, warmer conditions to the southern half of the United States and wetter weather to the northern half. The last La Niña began in September 2020.

But last month, sea-surface temperatures in that part of the ocean rose, scientists say, signaling the end of La Niña and the start of a new neutral climate pattern (this occurs when the sea-surface temperatures are at or near average). But this neutral period may be short-lived: By summer, rising sea-surface temperatures could lead the opposing El Niño pattern to develop, according to NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. By the fall, forecasters believe, there is a 62 percent chance El Niño will form.

Warmer water tends to hold less oxygen, and large-scale fish die-offs may happen earlier in the year as the climate continues to warm. Last week, thousands of dead fish washed up on Texas beaches from unusually warm waters and lack of oxygen in the Gulf of Mexico. Across the ocean, higher temperatures contribute to coral reefs dying. The ocean also expands as it warms, raising sea levels even further on top of the added water from melting ice sheets.

Last month’s unusual heat contributed to Canada’s spate of wildfires. As wildfire smoke spread, air quality in western Canada and the northern Great Plains in the United States deteriorated significantly. More recently, the wildfire smoke reached cities in the Northeast and Midwest, causing Air Quality Index readings to skyrocket across much of the country.

Extreme heat can be dangerous to humans as well as wildlife. Over the next several days, parts of Florida, Louisiana and Texas are bracing for potential triple-digit temperatures, which put people at risk, especially if they work outdoors or lack air-conditioning.

drought,How to Collect Greywater,2021-07-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/magazine/how-to-collect-greywater.html,"Calif., Oakland, Eugene, Ore.","“Greywater is gently used water,” says Laura Allen, 45, who lives in Eugene, Ore., in a duplex where water draining from a washing machine, showers and sinks is piped out to irrigate blueberry bushes, fruit trees, flowers and ornamental bushes. This type of household wastewater, which does not come in contact with feces, can be reused to water plants. Check regional greywater laws. Its use is legal in about half the country, especially in Western states, and even encouraged by the authorities.

The easiest way to start utilizing greywater is with a low-cost laundry-to-landscape system. Find your washing machine’s discharge hose, which is probably emptying into a nearby standpipe or utility sink. Install a three-way diverter valve, allowing you to send water either through existing pipes to the sewer or through a new, plastic pipe that you route outdoors. Once outside, insert one-inch plastic tubing into what is called barb tee fittings to direct the water to specific plants. Laundry-to-landscape systems work best to irrigate trees or bushes and not lawns or vegetable crops.

If you’re on flat ground, the pump from your washing machine is capable of moving the water about 50 feet. Dig a shallow basin near the plant where the water will drain; fill it with mulch to hold moisture. Don’t store greywater — “It gets smelly,” Allen says — or let it pool. Use only liquid laundry detergents free of boron. If you use chlorine bleach, switch your valve and send that load’s water to the sewer.

Allen became interested in greywater two decades ago, when she received her first water bill as a new college graduate in a shared rental house in Oakland, Calif. “I was shocked to see how much water we used,” she says. (Each American, on average, uses as much as 100 gallons a day at home.) She and her roommate started experimenting with D.I.Y. greywater systems, which were then illegal. Calling themselves the Guerrilla Graywater Girls, they even self-published a zine as a guide for others. In the face of historic droughts and climate change, find a way to proactively do something. If you are a renter and your landlord won’t approve your greywater schemes, find other ways to reuse water from your bath or shower. “Just go and get a bucket,” Allen says.",laundrytolandscape systems work best irrigate trees bushes use liquid laundry detergents free boron check regional greywater laws,Calif.,,PCG,-3.0,10.44801139831543,10.308706283569336,9.870882987976074,-3.0,-1.3333170249848159,-3.0,-3.0

But the last harvest at the 36,000-acre plantation underscored another pivotal shift: the relentless spread of extremely flammable, nonnative grasses on idled lands where cash crops once flourished.

Varieties like guinea grass, molasses grass and buffel grass — which originated in Africa and were introduced to Hawaii as livestock forage — now occupy nearly a quarter of Hawaii’s landmass. Fast growing when it rains and drought resistant when lands are parched, such grasses are fueling wildfires across Hawaii, including the blaze that claimed at least 93 lives in Maui last week.

“These grasses are highly aggressive, grow very fast and are highly flammable,” said Melissa Chimera, whose grandmother lived on the Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company’s plantation in Maui after emigrating from the Philippines. “That’s a recipe for fires that are a lot larger and a lot more destructive,” added Ms. Chimera, who now coordinates the Pacific Fire Exchange, a Hawaii-based project sharing fire science among Pacific island governments.",nonnative grasses like guinea grass molasses grass bufel grass occupy nearly quarter hawaiis landmass fast growing rains drought resistant lands parched grasses,Hawaii,,HE,31.599451065063477,20.929758071899414,20.929758071899414,13.039999961853027,-33.76543779572339,0.0,-33.76543779572339,-58.73346048004574

So many of the conversations about global warming focus on the direst consequences, projected far into the future: images of fires and floods on an increasingly uninhabitable planet if the governments of the world — and especially those of the United States, China and the other leading greenhouse gas emitters — fail to curb their use of fossil fuels. But the truth is that we are already living in a world that is being transformed by climate change. Every single country on Earth is feeling its effects — today.

That is the idea behind “Postcards From a World on Fire,” a major project from Times Opinion that published this morning. Last summer, as the COP26 meeting in Glasgow approached, we began work on what I envisioned as an expansive climate project that would draw on nearly every journalistic tool at our disposal. I wanted an assessment of where things stood from every country in the world and to make a bold argument for urgency. That call to action felt even more necessary as we watched the Glasgow summit come and go with high hopes and, ultimately, tepid actions.

A team of our journalists — led by Meeta Agrawal, Times Opinion’s special projects editor — has documented one way that climate change is having an impact in each of the 193 United Nations member states. It’s been a breathtaking effort to watch come together.

Across the United States, power companies are struggling to keep the lights on in the face of increasingly extreme weather fueled by climate change. Record-breaking heat waves are causing widespread blackouts in places like California. Electric utilities in places like Oregon have recently started shutting off power lines to avoid sparking wildfires, a once-rare tactic that is becoming more widespread throughout the West.

The problem is only expected to get worse in the years ahead. As my colleague Ivan Penn and I wrote recently, many utilities nationwide have been slow to prepare for the effects of climate change, and are now scrambling to address the threat.

It’s not all bad news: There are a number of power companies that are starting to seriously plan for the dangers of a warming world. But as we describe in the article, adaptation can be a slow, costly and difficult endeavor that could ultimately mean higher electricity bills for many Americans. And if the brutal heat, drought and wildfires this summer are any indication, the clock is ticking fast.

Quotable: “It’s fair to say there was this widespread assumption that the impacts of climate change and extreme weather would unfold more gradually, and there would be more time to prepare,” said Alison Silverstein, an energy consultant based in Austin, Texas. “But in the past few years, the entire industry has really been smacked upside the head.”",effects climate change us felt across country power outages becoming common,the United States,,TRV,139.20779418945312,138.40249633789062,139.38368225097656,144.85426330566406,-0.5784861804982987,0.7089365719896463,0.12634929139388906,4.056144376892033

Crops are not subject to the vagaries of extreme weather, such as frost, heat or hail; they will never be recalled because of E. coli contamination from the dairy farm upstream; and produce can be bred for flavor instead of for tolerance to heat, rain and long-distance transportation.

Furthermore, these greenhouses can produce more food with fewer pesticides and less water. With computer-controlled root and air temperatures, nutrients and carbon dioxide levels, these plants are grown in nutrient-laden water rather than soil and provide yields up to 400 times greater per acre than field agriculture, with one-tenth the water used. Controlled agriculture also allows vegetable farms to operate where there is no arable land, whether in Kentucky coal country or an Egyptian desert.

A vast majority of the more than 2,300 controlled environment greenhouses in the United States — 100-acre structures or smaller vertical farms that grow crops on trays stacked to the ceiling — replace the warmth and light from the sun with fossil-fuel power, giving a new meaning to the term “greenhouse gas.” While there are efforts to make controlled agriculture more energy efficient — such as siting greenhouses adjacent to power or water treatment plants (or even server farms) to capture the waste heat those facilities generate — even greenhouses that use renewable electricity sources for lighting generally use natural gas for heating because it’s far more cost-effective.

The carbon footprint of any given greenhouse tomato, the leading indoor crop, can vary quite a bit, depending on energy sources, ambient temperatures and available natural light. But various studies conducted in the United States, Europe and Canada have estimated that, on average, the production of a pound of tomatoes in an American or Northern European greenhouse using fossil-fuel energy releases 3 to 3.5 pounds of carbon into the atmosphere.

That is, these studies suggest, about six times the carbon footprint of field tomatoes, even after taking into account the diesel emissions from refrigerated trucks that often transport field vegetables hundreds or even thousands of miles to reach consumers. Greenhouses, by contrast, can be built near major population centers, as is the case with large vertical farms often constructed in repurposed factories and warehouses.",advantages controlled agriculture technology pioneered netherlands many crops subject vagaries extreme weather frost heat hail controlled agriculture also allows vegetable farms operate,Canada,,IFC.TO,166.9508819580078,167.1019744873047,167.71578979492188,170.43548583984375,0.09050118665134002,0.3673297754263347,0.4581633998833593,2.087203038982687

The following month, however, precipitation was scarce. In December, it rained again, smashing records. Now, some parts of the state have barely seen another drop of water since early January.

“It has been both an unusually dry and an unusually wet winter,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Nature Conservancy.

But what do these ups and downs mean for California’s next fire season? The answer is complicated.

Before October, a vast majority of California was considered to be in “exceptional” or “extreme” drought (the highest rankings, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor).

When Nelson Mandela was released from Victor Verster Prison in 1990, after 27 years of incarceration, there was hope in the air. He and his wife, Winnie, raised clenched fists in triumph as they emerged from the prison gates, surrounded by supporters of different races. His release heralded a South Africa on the verge of transformation. The promise of a new rainbow nation drove masses in 1994 to the first inclusive general elections, but 30 years on, South Africa is floundering with power cuts, a tanking economy and xenophobia.

Karen Jennings’s compelling, meditative novel “Crooked Seeds” is set in Cape Town in the near future, when an extended drought has worsened already bleak living conditions for many South Africans. Deidre van Deventer must navigate her new life after the government reclaimed her family home to secure aquifers beneath her neighborhood. Her father is long dead, and her mother is struggling with mental illness at a care center across the street.

Deidre herself is struggling to survive; she moves through her crisis-stricken world on crutches, having lost a leg years ago. Indifferent to the plight of those around her, Deidre is a perpetual victim, lamenting her situation and taking advantage of everyone. In one scene, she cuts the line of people waiting at a truck for their daily allotment of water:

A dull sunrise held back beyond the streetlamps and she crutched ­toward it, into the road, ignoring the cone markers so that cars had to stop for her, three in a row. She kept her eyes on the water truck, did not acknowledge the cars, did not look at the queue.

After she receives her water ahead of the hordes, the rest of her day involves begging for help, cigarettes and drinks from her neighbors. In Deidre’s mind, her whiteness and disability entitle her to demand what she thinks is her due, and it is no coincidence that those she abuses are people of color.

Deidre’s life takes an abrupt turn when the police summon her to her family home, now a rubble-filled excavation site. Human bones have been found here, she is told. Might she know anything about them? We soon learn that Deidre’s brother, Ross, was believed to have belonged to a pro-apartheid group that sought to disrupt the 1994 elections by blowing up voting centers. He disappeared after one of his bombs exploded at their home, costing Deidre her leg.",karen jenings compelling meditative novel crooked seeds set cape town near future deidre van deventer must navigate new life government reclaimed family home,South Africa,,AMS.JO,83843.4921875,78483.2265625,79957.03125,68265.6328125,-6.393180299566706,1.877859451059059,-4.635375788986306,-18.579688141046276

Fires,2025-01-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/elon-musk-wildfires-la-california.html,"Los Angeles, Santa Ana, the United States, California","Elon Musk on Thursday inserted himself into the debate over the role climate change plays in wildfires as at least five fires scorched the Los Angeles area, charring entire neighborhoods, killing at least five people and forcing tens of thousands to flee.

“Climate change risk is real, just much slower than alarmists claim,” Mr. Musk wrote to his 211 million followers on X, the social media site he owns. He said the loss of homes was “primarily due” to “nonsensical overregulation” and “bad governance at the state and local level that resulted in a shortage of water.”

But scientists are clear: A warming planet, driven largely by the burning of fossil fuels, has created the conditions for increasingly destructive wildfires, along with more damaging hurricanes and other extreme weather.

Studies have found that extreme wildfires are getting more frequent and more intense, and fires are spreading faster, too.

“Wildfires have become larger and more frequent because of climate change in the Western part of the United States,” said Michael F. Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Regarding Mr. Musk’s comments, he said, “I find the whole thing pretty alarming.”

Scientists are unable to say with certainty that any single weather event was caused by global warming. But coming off the hottest year in history, the Los Angeles area has received less rainfall since the start of the rainy season in October than almost any other year since record-keeping began in 1877.

That drought turned vegetation into ready kindling, and temperatures have been above normal, further drying out grasses and scrubs. At the same time, Santa Ana winds have been unusually ferocious, blowing as fast as 100 miles per hour.

Benjamin Hatchett, a fire meteorologist at the University of Colorado, said there have been dry starts in past years but the combination of drought and high winds is fueling more destruction.

“This is probably just a bad, unfortunate, confluence of events,” Mr. Hatchett said. “I would be very hesitant to immediately say this is climate change and I don’t think that’s the right message here.

But because of climate change, he said, “this is the kind of conditions we expect to see more of going into the future.”

President-elect Donald J. Trump, Mr. Musk and other Republicans have sought to politicize the wildfires, using it as a way to attack Democratic officeholders in California. Mr. Trump in particular has seized on environmental regulations, including federal and state protections for California’s endangered delta smelt fish. He falsely claimed that those regulations led to inadequate water availability for firefighting efforts.

Peter Gleick, co-founder of the Pacific Institute, a California research organization that focuses on water, said Mr. Trump was spouting “complete nonsense.”

“There’s no link between California’s water policies and efforts to protect endangered species and water availability for firefighters,” Mr. Gleick said. “They’re completely unrelated.""

He noted that Southern California reservoir levels, including ones that feed Los Angeles, are above normal for this time of year. “There’s no water shortage,” he said. “The real issue is that urban water systems are not built or designed to fight massive, urban wildfires.”",elon musk climate change risk real much slower alarmists claim scientists clear warming planet created conditions increasingly destructive wildfires,Los Angeles,,TRV,241.7808380126953,231.4829559326172,231.4829559326172,238.54408264160156,-4.259180406818429,0.0,-4.259180406818429,-1.3387145969457663

At a maritime conference last week in Stamford, Conn., Ilya Espino de Marotta, the canal’s deputy administrator, said the auction fees, which reached as much as $4 million per passage last year, “helped a little bit.”

But even now, during a quieter season for global shipping, auction fees can double the cost of using the canal. This month, Avance Gas, which ships liquefied petroleum gas, paid a $401,000 auction fee and $400,000 for the regular toll, said Oystein Kalleklev, the company’s chief executive. Auction fees are ultimately borne by the company whose goods are being shipped.

The canal’s financial stability in the face of a dire water shortage shows how the people who manage crucial links in global supply chains are adapting as climate change disrupts operations. It also helps that there are no viable alternatives in Latin America to the canal, an engineering marvel that opened in 1914 and handles an estimated 5 percent of seaborne trade.

If delays continue and the cost keeps rising, however, shipping companies may find ways to avoid the canal. Last year, as the canal became backed up, ships that wanted to travel from Asia to the East Coast of the United States began going through the Suez Canal, a far longer voyage that uses much more fuel.

Many vessels are still using a western route from Asia even after the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea forced shipping companies to avoid the Suez Canal and go around Africa. Mr. Kalleklev said that, after his vessels had delivered their cargo and were empty, they now typically returned to the United States via the Cape of Good Hope.",panama canal authority declined say much money earned auctions auction fees ultimately borne company whose goods shipped delays continue cost keeps rising shipping companies may find ways avoid canal,the United States,,TRV,221.07212829589844,222.19227600097656,220.54151916503906,221.6027069091797,0.5066887959656501,-0.7429406933705673,-0.24001629465889548,0.2400024903053751

Now, August is shaping up to be a month of extremes.

In the United States alone, a tropical storm swept across the Southwest, another struck Texas, Maui burned, and a blistering heat dome sat atop the middle of the country. In India, torrential rains triggered deadly landslides, Morocco and Japan hit new heat records, and southern Europe braced for another scorching heat wave.

Those extremes have also brought high-stakes tests for public officials: Where public alerts and education worked, death and destruction were minimized. Where they didn’t, the results were catastrophic. Maui has so far recorded more than 100 deaths from the blaze that started Aug. 8, and that number is projected to rise.

Not all of the extreme weather events can be immediately attributed to climate change. But they reflect the hazards that much of the world needs to prepare for as El Niño, a natural weather pattern that can play out over several years, aggravates the weather extremes fueled by the burning of fossil fuels.

A National Park Service report estimated that two fires in September, sparked by a lighting storm, caused 2,261 to 3,637 mature giant sequoias — or between 3 to 5 percent of the population of mature giant sequoias — to be killed or so severely burned that they were expected to die within five years. Mature giant sequoias have a diameter of more than four feet.

Giant sequoias, which are found on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada in California, can live thousands of years on their way to dwarfing most everything around them. These trees include iconic national treasures like the General Sherman Tree, which is considered the world’s largest tree, standing at 275 feet tall with a diameter of 36 feet at the base.

The death of the trees in staggering numbers is the product of a “deadly combination” of unnaturally dense forests caused by fire suppression that began about 150 years ago and increasingly intense droughts driven by climate change, Clay Jordan, superintendent of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, said in an interview on Friday night.",5 percent worlds giant sequoias expected die within five years report says trees dying fire climate change,California,,PCG,12.318702697753906,12.179396629333496,12.268949508666992,12.398306846618652,-1.1308501539355285,0.735281738980503,-0.40388334963214645,0.6462056177332738

Streams whoosh, swollen with winter rains, and birds — robins, sparrows, grosbeaks, woodpeckers and hawks — trill and chatter.

But in 2011, a yearslong drought set in. By spring 2015, a local creek had dried up and the valley had gone quiet. “The park went from an extremely vibrant habitat to one that was dead silent,” said Bernie Krause, a soundscape ecologist who has been recording in the park since 1993. “Nothing was singing, nothing was chirping, nothing was moving. It’s like it was dead.”

In the coming years, severe droughts are likely to become more common; as the water dries up, bird song could disappear along with it. It is just one example of how climate change may be altering the planet’s soundscapes, or “breaking Earth’s beat,” as Dr. Krause and his colleagues put it in a paper last year. Dr. Krause, who has amassed more than 5,000 hours of natural recordings for his company, Wild Sanctuary, wrote the paper with Jérôme Sueur, an ecoacoustician at the French National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and Almo Farina, an ecologist at the University of Urbino in Italy.

Climate change will silence some species and nudge others into new habits and habitats, changing when and where they sing, squeak, whistle, bellow or bleat.

drought,Climate Disaster Is the New Normal. Can We Save Ourselves?,2021-09-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/07/opinion/climate-change-disaster-adaptation.html,the United States,"Mitigate, adapt or suffer

Fourteen years ago, a Harvard climate and energy expert, John Holdren, coined a kind of axiom for the three choices climate change posed for humanity: Mitigation — the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions — adaptation and suffering. “We’re going to do some of each,” he said. “The question is what the mix is going to be.”

For years, the policy conversation has rightfully been dominated by the first part of the equation, because, as he explained, “the more mitigation we do, the less adaptation will be required and the less suffering there will be.”

But nations delayed curbing their emissions for so long that global warming is now guaranteed to intensify in the next three decades. And that means that mitigation alone, while still as necessary as ever, is no longer sufficient to prevent suffering: As devastating as recent extreme weather events have been, scientists say the next 30 years will bring even more, hotter heat waves, longer and more intense droughts, and more episodes of catastrophic flooding.

In its 2018 National Climate Assessment, the federal government released a sweeping report of all the ways the United States would need to adapt. Here are just four, courtesy of The Times’s Brad Plumer:

Rethink how we farm: Intensifying drought and extreme heat jeopardizes both the yields of crops and the workers who harvest them. Farmers may have to use more precise irrigation techniques to conserve water, relocate production and invest in climate-controlled buildings.

Build for the future, not the past: The nation’s deteriorating infrastructure — its roads, sewer systems, public transportation, power plants and transmission lines — was built with historical weather conditions in mind, so it can’t just be repaired; it also has to be rebuilt or retrofitted for the weather of the future.

Enlist nature to help: Restoring degraded wetlands and expanding green space can protect cities and coasts from flooding, while planting more trees can reduce urban temperatures and protect people from deadly heat waves.

Expect the unexpected: Earth hasn’t warmed this quickly in tens of millions of years, long before humans even existed. Changes this rapid are likely to bring unpredictable dangers, and the more the world warms, the greater the risk of such surprises, some of which may be irreversible and self-reinforcing.

At the moment, however, there is no national plan for climate adaptation, just as there is no national plan for mitigation. Every year, the federal government spends about $46 billion on recovery from disasters — about seven times what it spends on resilience, as David G. Victor, Sadie Frank and Eric Gesick note in The Times. In many cases, recovery money is spent in ways that increase the risks and costs of climate change by inviting people to build and move into harm’s way.

“When communities are flattened by nature, the nation helps pay for rebuilding — often rebuilding the same infrastructure in the same place, a target for the next disaster,” they write. “Redirecting federal money toward resilience rather than simply rebuilding after disasters will be hard. But the longer we wait, the harder it will become as the costs of climate change mount.”",scientists say next 30 years bring even hotter heat waves longer intense droughts episodes catastrophic flooding national plan climate adaptation,the United States,,TRV,-3.0,146.06683349609375,146.9369659423828,146.6763153076172,-3.0,0.5957084339151724,-3.0,-3.0

Canada has been struggling to fight an extraordinary outbreak of wildfires across the country that has forced tens of thousands of people from their homes, deepened concerns about global warming and, this month, sent choking smoke billowing down the East Coast of the United States, from New York City, past Washington, and as far west as Minnesota.

How has the smoke affected air quality in the American Midwest?

On Tuesday, Canada’s wildfires were worsening air quality in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee, among other places. In Chicago, the Air Quality Index reached 209 by noon on Tuesday, the worst reading of any major city in the world for the day, according to IQAir, a Swiss air-quality technology company. (The index climbed higher in Chicago on Wednesday morning to 216, though the air quality was worse in Detroit, where the index hit 306.)

Across California over the weekend, there were parades and fireworks — legal and not. Families had beach barbecues and flew American flags. Dogs were dressed for the occasion, and so were their people. Campers hiked in national parks, visitors lined up for Dole Whips at Disneyland, and children pressed their masked faces to the glass of the penguin exhibit at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

The Fourth of July weekend felt like a preview of the summer to come in California, without limits on businesses or gatherings. In fact, this year, Gov. Gavin Newsom and state tourism officials have been trying to juice back up what was a $145-billion-a-year industry.

Tourism officials have framed vacationing in California by Californians as a kind of act of local patriotism.

drought,Here’s Where California Really Uses Its Water,2021-12-10,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/10/us/california-water-drought.html,California,"Take this example: When California was slammed with an atmospheric storm in late October, many of us skipped watering our lawns. After months of water savings of no more than 5 percent compared with last year, Californians’ water usage in October dropped to 13.2 percent below the rate in October 2020, according to new state data. While still short of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 15 percent target, it’s the closest we’ve come.

“This jump in water savings we saw across the state can illustrate just how much water can be conserved when we’re not irrigating outdoors, even for just part of the month,” said Charlotte Ely, who presented the savings data to the State Water Resources Control Board this week.

Half of California’s annual water usage is considered environmental water, meaning it flows through protected rivers or supports wetlands in wildland preserves, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. The other 50 percent is for human use — 40 percent for agriculture and 10 percent for urban use, split between indoor (drinking water, showers) and outdoor (lawns, washing our cars).

But the relatively warm, dry weather in California tips the scales toward outdoor consumption. Plants quickly evaporate water, so keeping them green is more water-intensive than in other parts of the nation, said Jay Lund, co-director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis.

Weather.” There are three affairs, three comas, three divorces, one separation, an exploration of gender identity, a brain tumor, in vitro fertilization, the end of a career and the threat of bankruptcy. There are other health issues, relationship problems and characters reckoning with past traumas, including a miscarriage and a rape. Most of these struggles take place in 2016, and are exacerbated by drought, threat of wildfire and the presidential election.

There’s a lot going on — and in some ways, the chaos and the mess feel true to family life. The novel sometimes even seems aware of its own outrageousness, as when one character says, “The more I think about it, the more I believe this scheme could only work if we were living in Telenovelaland.” But there’s a dearth of fallout or causality, which forces the reader to repeatedly suspend her disbelief. Events happen quickly, and often have little bearing on each other; we leave one scene and enter another without being given a chance to reflect. The characters are caught up in a similar whirlwind; they endure “life-changing” events but within a few pages are back to contemplating trivialities like traffic — and then go careening toward entirely new life-changing events. Their actions are more than once described as involuntary — one character buys an orchard “on impulse”; another gets married “on a whim” — and this doesn’t quite feel psychologically realistic. The Alvarados are also not an especially sympathetic bunch, which is not in itself objectionable — bad behavior is fruitful fictional fodder. But there is a lack of accountability, of engagement with the world, that makes it difficult to invest in the characters or to grasp what’s really at stake.

Escandón sets up two tracks: the one where the story runs and its more complex neighbor, traversing the terrain of family history and the physical world. While the former is difficult to digest, the latter is masterfully executed, rife with nuance and detail and the telltale signs of a gifted writer who knows her material well. Escandón’s narrative voice is often witty and warm, and her meditations on Los Angeles are lush and lyrical. Of the Pacific Ocean, she writes: “Its undulating surface shimmered in bright oranges and reds, sequins in a drag queen’s gown. This was a light — a hyper-real, Technicolor light — that only existed on celluloid and in Los Angeles.”

Toward the end of the book, Oscar muses: “There were hundreds of cities within his city, each telling a different story. He’d need several lifetimes to understand its many incarnations.” The same could be said for “L.A.

Because Democrats could lose control of Congress after 2022 and Republicans have shown little interest in climate legislation, it could be years before another opportunity arises — a delay that scientists say the planet cannot afford.

The climate provisions are designed to quickly transform energy and transportation, the country’s two largest sources of greenhouse gases, from systems that now mostly burn gas, oil and coal to sectors that run increasingly on clean energy from the sun, wind and nuclear power.

The impact will touch a broad cross-section of American life, from the kinds of cars that Americans drive, to the types of crops grown by farmers, to the way homes are heated and buildings are constructed. One measure could shutter virtually all of the nation’s remaining coal plants, forcing sweeping change in communities dependent on mining but also, one study estimated, preventing as many as 50,000 premature deaths from pollution by 2030. And other measures would provide billions to replant in national forests, repair trails for hikers and clear brush to reduce the risk of wildfire.

Alison, whose panic over the devastations Patrick treats as pathological, is the novel’s moral center. But she’s a center at the sidelines, a continent away. The energy and action is all powered by the odd-couple detective team of Patrick and Cassidy, gallivanting through Los Angeles, investigating the shoddiness of the film they’re both counting on to succeed, the artificial WAT-R with its faint taste of marshmallow and the mysterious armada of green medical vans whose vigilance seems increasingly required.

Theirs is a screwball comedy in a sci-fi hellscape, a freighted parable with an antic disposition and a cool affect. But the balance wobbles. Kleeman, who is often compared to postmodern writers like Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon, can turn a beautiful sentence, but she can seem overfond of the funhouse-mirror refractions between reality, surreality and whatever middle dimension between them exists on television and film. (One reason that Cassidy Carter turns out to be effective is the lessons she has absorbed from her hit television show, “Kassi Keane: Kid Detective,” whose obsessive fans haunt online forums to perform a parallel investigation of their own, close-reading the series for clues to an ominous and hazily defined “Big Reveal.”) “Something New Under the Sun” is more plotted than “You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine,” which struggled under the weight of its thoughtful aimlessness, but in satirizing pop-culture ephemera, it ultimately bends to their same gravity.

Amid a historic drought, Gov. Gavin Newsom has asked us to reduce water consumption by 15 percent. Yet in August, the most recent month for which data is available, we’d brought usage down just 5 percent compared with the same time last year.

Of course, not all water-saving is the responsibility of California households. Eighty percent of California’s water goes toward agriculture, and other businesses play a big role too.

But that doesn’t mean we can’t conserve more — and many of us seem to be trying. You wrote to me about letting your cars get dusty and your lawns turn brown and collecting cold shower water to boil pasta and fill your dog’s bowl.

Maui’s arguments are also likely to resonate with a local jury.

“Here in Hawaii, folks are in disaster recovery mode, and the longer arc of something like a lawsuit necessarily has to take a back seat,” said Richard Wallsgrove, law professor and adviser to the Environmental Law Program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. “But it’s also clear that what’s at stake in these cases, and all the climate litigation cases that are brewing in Hawaii and elsewhere, is seen right there in the Maui wildfires.”

Scientists are increasingly able to attribute specific disasters, like extreme weather or wildfires, to global warming, and even tie events to fossil fuel producers. And while that attribution can take time, scientists have pointed to Hawaii’s declining average rainfall as well as drought, hurricane winds and other conditions linked to climate change as factors that fueled the Maui fire.

At the same time, academic and congressional researchers, environmental groups, journalists, and lawyers have chronicled how oil and gas companies, despite knowing for decades that burning fossil fuels would dangerously heat the planet, have worked to downplay or deny that knowledge.

“We have now entered the most intense phase of this heat wave,” said Elliot Mainzer, chief executive of the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the grid.

Over the past week, Californians have reduced their electricity use to as much as 2 percent below forecast, giving the grid operators a significant buffer, said Mr. Mainzer. But as the heat wave, which is setting records even at night, continues through the rest of the week, “we need two to three times as much conservation as we’ve been experiencing to keep the power on,” Mr. Mainzer said.

In August 2020, several hundred thousand Californians lost power in rolling blackouts during a heat wave, but the state sidestepped that scenario last summer. Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state had added at least 8,000 megawatts of clean energy to the grid since 2020, and he signed legislation last week that may allow the state’s last operating nuclear power station, at Diablo Canyon, to remain in service past its scheduled closure in 2025. But severe drought has reduced the availability of hydropower, and solar power generation wanes as night falls, leaving the state to rely heavily on aging gas-fired power plants and on imported electricity from other states.

Across California, officials have asked residents to set their air-conditioning at a sticky 78 degrees in hopes of conserving power. When extreme heat rolls in, air-conditioning acts as a lifesaver.

The European heat wave that baked Italy, France and Spain over the past week has reached London, putting life on hold and testing infrastructure. Britain this morning recorded its highest temperature ever, as the heat led some schools, museums and doctors’ offices to close, and some trains and flights to be canceled. Forecasters reported temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius, or 104 degrees Fahrenheit, today in London. Officials issued Britain’s first “red” warning for extreme heat, declaring a national emergency in a country accustomed to temperate weather, where few homes have air conditioning. In the U.S., President Biden reportedly may declare a climate emergency as soon as this week, according to The Washington Post.

The human toll of the heat wave has been alarming. Hundreds of people have died across Europe. Thousands more have had to flee wildfires in Spain, France and Greece.

Extreme heat is also hurting the economy, according to a study last year by European economists and climate experts. The researchers estimated that heat waves on average had lowered overall annual G.D.P. growth across Europe by as much as 0.5 percent in the past decade, potentially more than twice the damage they estimated from heat waves in previous decades. The reason: Extreme heat tends to lower productivity, currently for those who work outside, but increasingly for people who work inside, too.

It’s been a pressure cooker of a summer for businesses and consumers in Europe. Inflation, as elsewhere, is at its highest level in decades. What’s more, the war in Ukraine has raised oil and gas prices, as Russia has threatened to cut off supplies.

Chief Kristin Crowley of the Los Angeles Fire Department acknowledged at a news conference on Monday that vegetation in the region, parched from months of drought and dried out even more by the wind, could be powerful fuel for extreme fire behavior.

But she said that federal, state and local crews and equipment were in place to respond if new fires break out. “Additional resources are in the region” now, she said, compared with on Jan. 7, when the Palisades and Eaton fires erupted.

On that day, Chief Crowley said, the department had about 14 engines stationed ahead of time to respond to the “particularly dangerous situation” that the National Weather Service had warned about. On Monday, in preparation for similar conditions, the department had 30 engines, as well as a larger number of extra crews, stationed in areas like the vicinity of the Palisades fire, which was still only about 59 percent contained.

Tactical “task forces” of three engines were ready at four fire stations around the city, along with “strike teams” at other locations, she said.

“Everyone needs to be on high alert,” Mayor Karen Bass said at the news conference. “We ask Angelenos to be prepared, in case they need to evacuate.”

Wind gusts of 50 to 70 miles an hour were expected in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties starting Monday afternoon and extending into Tuesday, with falling humidity levels.

“If it is ignited, extreme fire weather and behavior is probable,” Chief Crowley said.

The Los Angeles Fire Department has faced criticism that it did not deploy sufficient resources two weeks ago to prepare for the unusually dangerous conditions the National Weather Service had forecast.

On Jan. 7, the department called up about 100 firefighters for overtime and positioned nine trucks in high-risk areas, but none of those trucks were sent to Pacific Palisades, where a fire quickly grew out of control and devoured thousands of structures.

Then came the droughts.

Hydropower, the biggest source of renewable energy in the world, was crippled by lack of rain in several countries last year, driving up emissions as countries turned to fossil fuels to fill the gap. To cope with the electricity shortfall, China and India turned to coal plants, and Colombia to natural gas.

A recent report by the International Energy Agency showed that hydropower’s decline last year pushed countries to use dirtier sources of energy that produced an extra 170 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. That’s like turning on an extra 42 coal-fired power plants for a year.

That water comes primarily from two sources. The California State Water Project draws snow runoff from the Sierra in Northern California, where this year the snowpack in some places was at just 5 percent of its average. And water also comes from the Colorado River and its Lake Mead and Lake Powell reservoirs, which are lower now than ever.

I spoke with Kightlinger, who retired in July, about whether we’ve crossed a permanent threshold of crisis. (We have, he said.) And whether the recently announced conservation measures, some of the strictest ever imposed, are enough. (They’re not.)

Here is our conversation, edited and condensed for clarity:

What’s the current situation for water in Southern California?

Very grim. The State Water Project is only delivering 5 percent. An acre-foot of water is 326,000 gallons. On average, you hope to get a million acre-feet out of it a year.

The lawn is dead. Long live the lawn. Lately this entrenched symbol of American domestic life — verdant, weed-free and crisply mowed — has come under wider scrutiny as a profligate relic, out of sync with an ecologically conscious era.

For many years, environmentalists have deplored conventional turf grass lawns as biodiversity dead zones that require billions of gallons of water every week in the United States, with outdoor irrigation accounting for a third of household water consumption on average nationwide, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. To say nothing of the polluting fertilizers and toxic pesticides and all the mowers belching greenhouse gases to keep those lawns lush and manicured.

“Lawns seem to draw as much irrational hate as they do love these days,” said Paul Robbins, dean of the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the author of “Lawn People: How Grasses, Weeds, and Chemicals Make Us Who We Are.”

He added, “Green lawns, as much as brown ones, are now seen as a moral failing.”

As human activity continues to heat the planet, warmer air holds more moisture. That means storms that blow through California most winters, known as atmospheric rivers for their long shape and the huge amounts of water they carry, are more likely to be extremely intense.

Atmospheric rivers that come in a rapid-fire procession, like those in California since late December, can be particularly dangerous. Land and streams already saturated from one downpour simply can’t accommodate water from the next one, which amplifies the potential for flooding and landslides. The most catastrophic flooding in modern California history took place in the winter of 1861, when successive weeks of powerful storms caused epochal deluges across the West Coast.

The findings were echoed by national data also published on Monday, which found that just 30 percent of eighth graders in the state achieved proficiency in reading and 23 percent in math, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, known as the nation’s report card. (The national exam, which is separate from the California one, sampled students around the country and is generally considered more rigorous than many state tests.)

This was the jarring question that went through my mind as I walked in a grove of magnificent sequoias with my teenager one recent weekend.

We had taken a leisurely drive from Los Angeles, stopped for enchiladas in a tiny restaurant tucked amid fruit orchards, sat on a rock and watched a squirrel take apart its food in the shade of these giant old trees. We learned that sequoias, native to the western Sierra Nevada, are some of the oldest, most adaptive trees of North America. They can survive extreme drought, heat, cold. They reproduce through fire.

But as the teenager pointed out, even some of the toughest creatures have their breaking point.

And while many American commentators blame the end of a Pax Americana and a resulting vacuum of geopolitical leadership, those closer to the Sahel tend to see the American war on terrorism, particularly the U.S.-led invasion of Libya in 2011, as a major contributor to regional instability. On the ground, animosity toward the French is also pervasive, and there is influence jockeying and obvious strategic meddling by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar, along with widespread suspicion about Russia (with its state-funded military contractor the Wagner group recently rebranding on the continent).

The past few years have been especially difficult ones across the Sahel, with the pandemic and Covid recessions and a surge in hunger partly driven by the war in Ukraine. Public revenues have fallen, countries are struggling through sovereign debt crises, and inflation has been soaring. Islamist militants, now largely forgotten or ignored by civilians in the United States, continue to be a source of Sahelian instability, with the failure to contain them in certain countries widely seen as an indictment of existing elites. There are generational dynamics at play, too, with booming youth populations increasingly frustrated with older leadership regimes and demographic ones as well, with rapid and disorderly urbanization from an increasingly harsh and conflict-ridden agricultural countryside.

I think it’s also worth flagging another possible contributor: climate change.

Climate researchers have long projected that the Sahel would be one of the regions most threatened by the impacts of warming. The Institute for Economics and Peace has identified the Sahel as one of its ecological threat hot spots, and according to Notre Dame’s Global Adaptation Initiative’s index, all six countries in the region rank among the least prepared places in the world. Writing for the Council on Foreign Relations in 2022, Beza Tesfaye noted that “Sahelian countries are simultaneously among the most affected by climate change and the least prepared to adapt,” an observation underlined last year by the I.M.F. as well. And in November 2022 the United Nations warned that climate impacts could bring about political instability and further conflict in 10 nations of the greater Sahel. In the last five years, those 10 nations have experienced a total of eight attempted or successful coups.

Across the region, environmental struggle has profoundly shaped a half-century of history, but the recent disruptions are nevertheless significant. In Niger, there have been nine droughts and five major flooding events in the last 20 years, with food crises every four years and many parts of the country without a good harvest in a decade. In 2022, an intense rainy season produced devastating flooding in Mali and Chad, events the World Weather Attribution network estimated were made 80 times more likely by climate change. Southeast of the coup belt, a three-year drought in the Horn of Africa has left more than four million people in need of humanitarian assistance; according to the W.W.A.’s “conservative estimate,” the drought was made 100 times more likely by climate change.

These disasters aren’t the source of all of the recent political turmoil. As in many unstable parts of the world, climate change may not be directly causing political disruptions, but it is pressuring already fragile systems. “The patient, as it were, is suffering from lots of different kinds of ailments,” the political scientist Kenneth Schultz told me. “But this is another one.” Last August, Roland Ngam, of the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation, wrote in South Africa’s Daily Maverick that “behind all the coups” are “weak institutions and especially climate change which has caused a massive ecosystem collapse over the last century.” And in November Abdoulie Ceesay, the deputy majority leader of the Gambian National Assembly, wrote in The New Internationalist: “The simple fact is that the rise of militarism has gone hand in hand with the rise in poverty, food insecurity, economic crises and extreme weather.

drought,Why Does the American West Have So Many Wildfires?,2022-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/01/climate/wildfire-risk-california-west.html,"Los Angeles, Western United States","In just one weekend, the McKinney Fire, fueled by strong winds and high temperatures, burned more than 55,000 acres in Northern California, becoming the state’s largest wildfire so far this year. The blaze is only the beginning of the West’s fire season, which traditionally peaks between mid-July and October.

All fires need fuel and a spark. In the West, fuel is plenty, with flammable pine needles, shrubs and grasses that can ignite easily. And while the region’s dry vegetation has always made it prone to fires, climate change is intensifying wildfires and lengthening fire season.

There’s not necessarily an increase in the number of fires in the West, “but the fires are bigger, more severe, and last longer so the total area burned per year is rapidly increasing,” said Morgan Tingley, an ecologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the effects of wildfire on Western ecosystems.

Why does the West have so many catastrophic wildfires? There are four key factors.

Climate and landscape

The Western United States has what’s called a Mediterranean climate, which means that most of its rain comes during the winter months, which are wet and cool. It also means that summer, the region’s driest season, aligns with its hottest, creating suitable conditions for a fire.",mckiney fire burned 50 acres northern california blaze beginning wests fire season traditionally peaks midjuly october climate change intensifying wildfires,Los Angeles,,TRV,150.14324951171875,147.84429931640625,148.26058959960938,154.13575744628906,-1.5311712000299194,0.2815734425527014,-1.2539091289365178,2.6591324935049414

But just as the events on that November day unexpectedly propelled a recall few had taken seriously, his fate could shift just as swiftly and dramatically. Democrats need to think through the consequences and weigh what is best for the state against what is best for Mr. Newsom.

In the fall, voters will be asked two questions: Should Mr. Newsom be recalled? And if so, who should replace him? Many unpredictable factors will influence those votes. Will the relatively low numbers of Covid-19 cases hold? Will students be back in classrooms that have been largely empty for more than a year? Will the drought and looming fire season trigger water shortages, power shut-offs, devastation and apocalyptic imagery? Will he commit another blunder like the French Laundry dinner, reinforcing his image as an out-of-touch elitist?

And crucially: Will a credible Democrat enter the contest?

It is obviously in Mr. Newsom’s interest to keep other Democrats off the ballot and brand the election a Republican recall. A “Vote no” message is cleaner than “Vote no, but just in case, vote for this other Democrat.” Worse than muddled messaging, a viable Democratic alternative, even posed as an insurance policy, could morph into a real threat. Mr. Newsom already finds himself navigating with difficulty between conflicting constituencies on issues like health care, housing, fracking and drought. Some groups have signaled that their enthusiasm in opposing the recall is contingent on the governor’s actions in the intervening months. The election (still technically unofficial pending a 30-day waiting period) is likely to occur just after he must decide the fate of bills passed during the legislative session.

In 2003, amid energy and fiscal crises, California voters ousted an unpopular governor, Gray Davis, in the state’s first gubernatorial recall, which felt, despite its zanier moments, like an exercise in democracy that bore some resemblance to the process lawmakers envisioned in 1911.

But then climate change, in a few different ways, seems to also load the dice toward more fire in the future.”

People

Even if the conditions are right for a wildfire, you still need something or someone to ignite it. Sometimes the trigger is nature, like the unusual lightning strikes that set off the L.N.U. Lightning Complex fires in August, but more often than not humans are responsible, said Nina S. Oakley, a research scientist at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego.

Many deadly fires have been started by downed power lines. The 2018 Carr Fire, the state’s sixth-largest on record, started when a truck blew out its tire and its rim scraped the pavement, sending out sparks. And some are started through bad decisions, like the fire that was ignited by smoke-generating fireworks as part of a gender-reveal party east of Los Angeles.

Events like gender reveal parties can trigger a blaze, Dr. Oakley noted, but “you also have the human contribution to wildfire,” which includes the warming that has been caused by greenhouse gas emissions and the accompanying increased drying. Both contribute “to creating a situation favorable to wildfire,” she said.

“California has a lot of people and a really long dry season,” Dr. Williams said. “People are always creating possible sparks, and as the dry season wears on and stuff is drying out more and more, the chance that a spark comes off a person at the wrong time just goes up.

Still, even longtime residents have been staggered this year by the brute swiftness with which Tulare Lake has resurfaced: In less than three weeks, a parched expanse of 30 square miles has been transformed by furious storms into a vast and rising sea.

The lake’s rebirth has become a slow-motion disaster for farmers and residents in Kings County, home to 152,000 residents and a $2 billion agricultural industry that sends cotton, tomatoes, safflower, pistachios, milk and more around the planet. The wider and deeper Tulare Lake gets, the greater the risk that entire harvests will be lost, homes will be submerged and businesses will go under.

Across the region, the surprise barrage of atmospheric rivers that swept through California over the past three months already has saturated the ground, overflowed canals and burst through levees.

But over the longer term, the economic fallout caused by climate change is likely to be profound.

Devastating fires, floods and droughts tend to dominate the headlines. Other insidious effects may generate less attention but nonetheless take a toll. Researchers have found that extreme temperatures reduce labor productivity, damage crops, raise mortality rates, disrupt global trade and dampen investment.

An analysis by researchers associated with the Centre for Economic Policy Research found that in Europe, France, Italy, Spain, Romania and Germany have been most affected by climate-related disasters over the past 20 years. Central and Eastern European countries, however, have been increasingly hit with climate troubles.

Such developments put added pressure on public spending, as governments are called on to replace damaged infrastructure and provide subsidies and relief.

Over the past seven years, the United States as a whole averaged about 17.8 lightning strikes per square kilometer per year, according to a lightning density map published by Vaisala, a company that monitors global weather and environmental conditions. Florida averaged more than 87 strikes per square kilometer per year. But the figure for California was just 1.1; only Oregon and Washington had fewer.

Why isn’t California struck more often? The main reason is humidity, or rather the lack of it.

You’ve probably heard that wildfires in the Golden State have increasingly become a year-round danger, no longer limited to a few months a year. But even still, the start of the traditional summer-and-fall fire season brings a slew of heightened risks for us to contend with.

It’s true that drought conditions and extreme heat in California have increased the likelihood that fires break out in the winter. This year, in January, typically one of the state’s wettest periods, a wildfire swept through Big Sur — an event the National Weather Service called “surreal.”

But those off-season fires are generally low-intensity and less likely to exhibit the unpredictable and destructive behavior that has characterized the worst California fires in recent years. In 2020, more acres burned in the state than ever before, driven largely by massive fires that began in August and September.

“The ability for fires to burn straight through winter is probably increasing, but there’s still a very pronounced seasonality,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “I would bet a lot of money that August and September and October will see a whole lot more fire, and a whole lot more destructive fire.”",2020 acres burned state ever driven largely massive fires began august september ability fires burn straight winter probably increasing,Los Angeles,,TRV,153.86138916015625,154.35333251953125,151.15560913085938,160.0109100341797,0.3197315207280041,-2.071690540447028,-1.7585828673887731,3.9967927675619284

But that doesn’t mean that flowers aren’t blooming at all, of course.

“Things are still blooming all over California and will be for months and months,” Mr. Schreiner said. “You’re just not going to get those picture-perfect fields of endless California poppies, most likely, this year.”

[See images of the super bloom in 2019.]

If you’re on the hunt for those native blooms and curious about where to start, the answer isn’t always set in stone. With California’s wide swath of microclimates and dozens of factors that can affect whether there is a bloom or not, Mr. Schreiner said it could be hard to pinpoint exactly which canyon or area is certain to put on a show. But even if you’re not guaranteed those Instagram-worthy, poppies-as-far-as-the-eye-can-see kind of blooms, don’t be deterred.

“If you limit yourself to that, as what you’re looking for in wildflowers you are going to miss so much,” he said. “We have just this amazing diverse array of California native plants that all put on a show, really, throughout the year.”

One way to stay on top of where wildflowers are blooming is, of course the wildflower hotline. There are also other resources, Mr. Schreiner said, like DesertUSA.org.

Climate-related mass migration, and the political consequences it produces, may have profound consequences in addition to rising temperatures themselves. But when I first started thinking about the issue, I was extrapolating from what I knew about another kind of forced migration: the refugee crises that result when people flee from persecution or conflict. And it turns out that wasn’t the right way to think about the situation at all.

Refugees, under international law, are people who have been forced to flee their own countries because of persecution. That means that a lot of refugee policy debates are essentially about countries’ obligations to vulnerable foreigners.

But climate change is most likely to displace people within their own countries, and drive them to seek protection from their own governments.

“When we talk about climate displacement, rather than thinking about future climate refugees across borders, we could already be thinking about people displaced by hurricanes or about more people displaced by fires in the United States,” said Stephanie Schwartz, a political scientist at the London School of Economics who studies forced migration. “It’s hard to make that switch psychologically, because it’s not other-ing refugees or migrants. It’s ‘we could be refugees or migrants.’”

In some extreme cases, such as Pacific islands threatened by rising sea levels, internal migration might not be possible. And climate disasters can also exacerbate other causes of cross-border migration, such as violence or weak labor markets.",refugees people forced flee countries persecution climate change likely displace people within countries,the United States,,TRV,165.33096313476562,164.88626098632812,167.85415649414062,169.05287170410156,-0.268976929672279,1.7999653155204902,1.5261468944073584,2.251186649352615

This time of year, it’s always there — a kind of looming peril that tinges even the most perfect, blue-skied beach days and hikes. It’s the knowledge that at any moment, a fire could spark anywhere in the state and consume hundreds of thousands of acres, level homes and threaten lives.

In recent years, climate change has made wildfires bigger, hotter and faster. Last year, in particular, the sheer magnitude of the conflagrations and the plumes of toxic smoke they sent billowing over thousands of miles — all during a respiratory pandemic — served as a wake-up call for many: Once fire season is underway, it’s too late to prepare.

So, although there are already fires burning in California, we thought it would be useful to help you get ready.

Here’s what to know:

Why is this fire season likely to be so bad?

First, all the reasons that wildfires in California have been particularly catastrophic in the last couple of decades are still very much present. The troubling trends are continuing.",recent years climate change made wildfires bigger hotter faster last year sheer magnitude conflagrations served wakeup call,California,,PCG,9.950486183166504,10.119645118713379,10.298754692077637,10.049992561340332,1.700006737691326,1.76991951064614,3.5000149992701632,1.000015238875118

This water year was the seventh wettest for downtown Los Angeles, the fifth wettest for Santa Barbara and the second wettest for Bishop, McEvoy told me.

All that precipitation has replenished California’s lakes and groundwater supplies; the state’s reservoirs are currently at 128 percent of the average for this time of year, according to state data. The bounty was particularly welcome (and surprising) after three years of extreme drought, said Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources.

“This was as close to a miracle year as you can get,” Nemeth said during a news conference this month. It wasn’t only the record rainfall to be thankful for, she said, but that an unusually mild spring and summer had prevented all that snow from melting rapidly and causing extreme flooding, which was a major concern earlier in the year.

The favorable weather has also probably helped quiet California’s fire season. So far, 317,191 acres have burned in California this year, compared with an average of 1.5 million by this point in the past five years. Especially helpful in Southern California were the summer rains from Hurricane Hilary, which brought a reprieve during what would otherwise have been peak fire season.

So what’s in store for the new water year?

But his research suggests that platypuses, thanks to unsustainable water use and climate-driven drought, are actually in considerable trouble: extinct in 40 percent of their historical range, with bigger losses coming as climate change intensifies.

Tahneal Hawke, another University of New South Wales researcher, recently analyzed nearly 26,000 records of interactions with platypuses, going back to 1760: newspaper articles, explorers’ journals, books of natural history. The results, for modern platypus researchers, make for surreal reading. Dr. Bino was struck to read about people seeing (or shooting) platypuses by the dozen, or using terms like “mob” or “migration.” “I would never, in our years of studying platypuses, describe them that way,” he said.

The final four platypuses returned to Tidbinbilla on June 5. Their receivers, Dr. Meagher reported, “are tracking them happily moving about the ponds.” People who saw the platypuses slip into their recovered habitats described doing so with a feeling of relief, even of magic, after a painful summer. But Dr. May can’t shake the memory of those desperate days in December, when the air was orange and the bush crackled with dryness. And Dr. Bino warns that the story of happy news disguises a more alarming larger picture. “Rescuing platypuses from drying ponds is not really a viable strategy” for the survival of the species, he said.

The institute reported that 3,500 square miles had been clear-cut between August 2022 and July 2023, a 22.3 percent decrease from the same period a year earlier. The decline in tree loss is estimated to have reduced the country’s greenhouse gas emissions by 7.5 percent. Brazil is the world’s sixth largest emitter, by some measures.

“Behind this was a political decision,” Marina Silva, Brazil’s environment minister, said on Thursday at a news conference. “We are changing the image of the country when we change this reality.”

The announcement was an encouraging sign that local policies could change the trajectory of global forest loss.

drought,Can We Save the Redwoods by Helping Them Move?,2023-10-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/magazine/redwoods-assisted-migration.html,"North Carolina, Hawaii, Ohio, Newfoundland, Canada, Montreal, Australia","Torreya taxifolia is a conifer that grows only in the ravines of the Apalachicola River system, in the Florida Panhandle. The tree, also known as the “stinking cedar,” has been harmed by fungal disease since at least the 1960s. The Torreya Guardians, as the group called itself, cited evidence that the tree had been pushed to its current southerly location by the glaciers of the last ice age but was in fact better adapted to more temperate conditions than those of Northern Florida. It was unable to migrate back northward as the glaciers receded, in part, they argued, because a species of giant tortoise that may have helped disperse its seeds had gone extinct. The Guardians didn’t go through an official review process to validate their contentions. They considered the tree’s circumstances so dire, and officials so slow to act, that beginning in the mid-2000s, they started moving the tree on their own, planting seeds and young specimens on private lands in North Carolina, Ohio and elsewhere.

Their aggressive approach to conservation featured prominently in numerous scientific articles that followed, discussing the pros and cons of assisted migration. One common theme that has emerged is the need for a framework within which to make decisions about facilitating the migration of plants and animals, not least because the unintended consequences could be irreversible and dire. Any biologist can cite a litany of disasters following the movement of plants and animals from the environments in which they evolved — from the constraints imposed there by competitors, predators and parasites — into new ecosystems. The cane toad, native to Central and South America, was released in Australia in 1935 ostensibly to control agricultural pests; it didn’t, reproduced exponentially and became a pest in its own right. The mongoose, brought to Hawaii in 1883 to control rats, instead further decimated native bird populations. Even moving something just a few miles could cause problems. The red squirrel, transported from mainland Canada onto Newfoundland in 1963 to serve as a food source for the island’s declining martens, ended up eating so many black-spruce cones — and possibly preying on nests — that a native crossbill that also relies on the tree has been in decline ever since.

These cases underscore the reality that other plants and animals are already living where you might want to introduce something in order to save it. Adding another life form could upset the ecological balance on which the native organisms rely. For these and other reasons, Anthony Ricciardi, an ecologist at McGill University in Montreal who studies invasive species and is an outspoken skeptic of assisted migration, compares the approach to playing ecological roulette. It’s impossible to predict the outcome of moving plants and animals around, he says. “I would treat assisted migration as a tool of last resort,” he told me in an email. “And it should be recognized as a technofix, rather than a sustainable conservation strategy.”

Even so, in the roughly 15 years since the scientific debate over assisted migration first emerged among academics, what’s notable today is how, naysayers notwithstanding, it’s already being put into practice. Beginning in 2016, researchers from the University of Western Australia started releasing a captive-bred swamp tortoise into seasonal wetlands about 200 miles south of its natural range; it is thought that this makes it the first animal species ever relocated to protect it from climate change. Many of the animal’s native wetlands were fragmented and shrinking, and conservationists feared that global warming would finish the tortoise off. “It’s going to literally blink out in a few years if we don’t do it,” Nicola Mitchell, an associate professor at the university and the effort’s lead scientist, told me.

For trees, the conversation has shifted from “should we do it?” to “how can we do it best?” The U.S. Forest Service, among other agencies, has experiments underway around the country to study what trees will grow most vigorously in today’s rapidly shifting climate. Some of these trees are southern varieties of species that already grow in an area. But in a few other plots, the Forest Service has planted species, like the relatively drought-tolerant ponderosa pine, that don’t yet inhabit that region of the country. By moving these trees into the area, the agency is essentially testing which, if any, of today’s nonnative trees have the best chance of thriving there in the future.",torreya taxifolia conifer grows ravines apalachicola river system tree also known stinking cedar harmed,North Carolina,,DUK,82.5882797241211,82.95529174804688,83.94341278076172,84.5927505493164,0.4443875391904914,1.1911488850114356,1.640829741420124,2.427064508294726

Moscow has restricted its own exports, increasing costs elsewhere. Most important, it has stopped sales of fertilizer, needed by the world’s farmers. Before the war, Russia was the biggest exporter of fertilizer.

Its hostilities in Ukraine have also had a major impact. From March to November, Ukraine exported an average of 3.5 million metric tons of grains and oilseeds per month, a steep drop from the five million to seven million metric tons per month it exported before the war began in February, according to data from the country’s Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food.

That number would be even lower if not for an agreement forged in July by the United Nations, Turkey, Russia and Ukraine, called the Black Sea Grain Initiative, in which Russia agreed to allow exports from three Ukrainian seaports.

Russia continues to block seven of the 13 ports used by Ukraine. (Ukraine has 18 ports, but five are in Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014.) Besides the three on the Black Sea, three on the Danube are operational.

Russian news reports estimate that Russia’s natural gas exports by pipeline could fall as much as 50 percent in volume this year from last year. The drop points to the blow to Russia’s vital gas exports industry since the country invaded Ukraine.

Once Europe’s main supplier of natural gas, Russia has been subjected to heavy sanctions from the West since the invasion in February 2022. Europe’s main strategy for reducing dependence on Russian energy — increasing imports of liquefied natural gas from countries like the U.S., coupled with slashing demand — has worked surprisingly well.

While Russia has been able to hold its own in the oil market despite embargoes, it is much more difficult to find new customers for gas because it is still mostly transported through fixed pipelines.

I’m Not Screaming Into the Void Anymore.,2023-11-18,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/opinion/climate-change-report-us.html,the United States,"Two and a half years ago, when I was asked to help write the most authoritative report on climate change in the United States, I hesitated. Did we really need another warning of the dire consequences of climate change in this country? The answer, legally, was yes: Congress mandates that the National Climate Assessment be updated every four years or so. But after four previous assessments and six United Nations reports since 1990, I was skeptical that what we needed to address climate change was yet another report.

In the end, I said yes, but reluctantly. Frankly, I was sick of admonishing people about how bad things could get. Scientists have raised the alarm over and over again, and still the temperature rises. Extreme events like heat waves, floods and droughts are becoming more severe and frequent, exactly as we predicted they would. We were proved right. It didn’t seem to matter.

Our report, which was released on Tuesday, contains more dire warnings. There are plenty of new reasons for despair. Thanks to recent scientific advances, we can now link climate change to specific extreme weather disasters, and we have a better understanding of how the feedback loops in the climate system can make warming even worse. We can also now more confidently forecast catastrophic outcomes if global emissions continue on their current trajectory. But to me, the most surprising new finding in the Fifth National Climate Assessment is this: There has been genuine progress, too.

I’m used to mind-boggling numbers, and there are many of them in this report. Human beings have put about 1.6 trillion tons of carbon in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution — more than the weight of every living thing on Earth combined. But as we wrote the report, I learned other, even more mind-boggling numbers. In the last decade, the cost of wind energy has declined by 70 percent and solar has declined 90 percent.

Steingraber enlisted three composers — Gabriella Smith, Steven Mackey and Billy Childs — as well as the violinist Etienne Gara to create a three-part concert, with each chapter dedicated to one of the tree species.

The intermittent climate phenomenon known as El Niño, which typically means more rain and snow for California, developed over the summer and is expected to intensify in the next few months. And this year’s El Niño is predicted to be an exceptionally strong one — maybe even ranking in the top five on record, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at U.C.L.A.

“This is likely to become an event that is historically significant,” Swain told reporters earlier this month. “All of California has elevated odds of a wetter-than-average winter.”

Of course, there are no guarantees. Experts emphasize that not every El Niño period is extra wet in the Golden State, and that the effects of the weather pattern often vary across the state (typically, El Niño’s effects are greater in dry Southern California than in the north).

“We’ve had wet years in California that are not El Niño, like last year,” Alex Hall, the director of the Center for Climate Science at U.C.L.A, told me. “And we’ve had dry years when El Niños are occurring.”",el nino developed summer expected intensify next months years el nino predicted exceptionally strong one,California,,PCG,17.831274032592773,17.592458724975586,17.652162551879883,17.413352966308594,-1.3393059137595582,0.33937170373767483,-1.0044794353196689,-2.343753259134964

But the pipes that bring that water into Americans’ homes are sized more like fire hoses.

Oversize plumbing pipes move water inefficiently, wasting money and increasing the risk of waterborne diseases. And water efficiency is especially important as climate change makes droughts more frequent and severe. Efforts to right-size plumbing pipes to match the intake of water-saving products are slowly gaining traction, but homeowners and designers of multiunit properties who want to use these more sustainable pipes need to demand them during the project design phase.

When the current method for sizing pipes to transport hot and cold water throughout the home was created in the 1940s, it was under the assumption that every fixture had to be able to support a line of people for the bathroom, like at a sports stadium at halftime, according to Christoph Lohr, a mechanical engineer specializing in plumbing systems and the vice president of technical services and research for the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials, a trade organization.

But even during a party at home, there won’t be a line for the kitchen sink, the shower, the bathtub, the laundry machine, the dishwasher and the toilets, with people using them over and over.

Mountain House, a former stagecoach hotel with its saloon-style second-story balcony and steep roof, was a relic of the gold rush, a stop on the way to the mining towns that dot the thickly forested slopes and canyons of the Sierra Nevada.

The gold rush, the seminal period that helped transform a thinly populated territory into the magnet of talent and adventure-seekers that California would become, sent hundreds of thousands of people into the hills — “wanderers from the whole broad earth,” in the words of one 19th-century observer.

But the state’s wildfires, which are still burning, are challenging the survival of some of these towns, among the oldest and most storied of the frontier settlements in California.

First, it’s important to understand how fires spread. According to Doug Green, who runs a community wildfire program at the research institute Headwaters Economics, wildfires typically spread in any of three ways: flame contact, when a flame touches combustible material; radiant heat, when the heat of a fire raises the temperature high enough for a material to ignite; and ember generation, when a piece of burning debris ignites material.",wildfires began around los angeles last week spread terrifying speed disaster serves reminder dangers climate change live area prone wildfires minimize threat,California,,PCG,17.144750595092773,16.19614601135254,16.19614601135254,16.19614601135254,-5.532915620316735,0.0,-5.532915620316735,-5.532915620316735

Mr. Davis’s ideas were shocking when the essay appeared, but the events of recent years have won a lot of people over to his way of thinking. After the 2021 Dixie fire in rural Northern California, a Los Angeles Times op-ed series raised the possibility of abandoning small fire-prone towns in favor of supposedly more defensible cities. Now, while wildfires burn across greater Los Angeles, some commentators are questioning the wisdom of rebuilding. Has the time come, they ask, for a “managed retreat” from wildfire?

We need a serious discussion of how to live with fire in this new era. Today’s wildfires make clear that “let it burn” is not a realistic or humane response to the destruction of homes and communities — in either urban or rural places. These wildfires also make clear that the prospect of large-scale retreat from fire risk is a fantasy. Instead, we need greater investment in preparing our buildings, and community-led experiments in new ways to protect neighborhoods.

As scholars, we have spent the past two years studying how managed retreat from wildfire might work. Known primarily as a response to floods, managed retreat typically involves government buyouts of individual properties and, sometimes, collective relocation from high-risk areas. While managed retreat is the focus of substantial research and government programs when it comes to flooding, there is scarce precedent for applying it in response to wildfires.

But some PM2.5 or smaller particles can bypass these defenses and penetrate the deepest parts of your lungs.

Dr. Montrose described the lungs as an upside-down tree: Smoke travels through your airway, the trunk. The smallest particles can reach the tips of the tree’s leaves, the alveoli. These air sacs deposit oxygen from your breath into your bloodstream. When PM2.5 particles travel into them, it can impair lung function and cause irritation.

Even smaller particles of smoke, ones a thousandth the size of PM2.5 matter, may travel from your lungs into your bloodstream, which can cause damage at the cellular level, said Carlos Gould, an environmental health scientist and assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego. This could explain some of the health effects researchers have linked to wildfire smoke, including heart conditions, infertility and dementia.

Those who are very close to a wildfire could also ingest particles that settle into drinking water or food. Those particles are dangerous to consume, as they can contain potentially cancer-causing substances like benzene. Skin and hair follicles may also absorb smoke, which can cause itching and skin irritation.

Unanswered Questions

Untangling the relationship between health and smoke is challenging. There are huge variations in how healthy people are before smoke exposure, how much smoke they are exposed to and what’s in that smoke.

Two of the biggest questions researchers want to answer: How much time do you need to spend in smoky air to suffer health effects? And how smoky does the air have to be for that to happen?

One metric of wildfire smoke pollution is the air-quality index, which measures five pollutants on a scale of 0 to 500. Generally speaking, A.Q.I. levels over 100 are considered potentially risky for children, older adults and those with heart or lung diseases, and levels over 200 are considered “very unhealthy” for everyone.

Researchers are just beginning to study how different levels of air pollution might affect health by tracking the outcomes of wildfire survivors over time. After a fire in 2017, researchers at the University of Montana looked at members of a community that was exposed to heavy smoke for six weeks and followed them for two years.

Over those six weeks, the average A.Q.I. in the area was about 221. The researchers didn’t see any changes in participants’ lung function at first. “But then, in the next year or so, they started to see that lung function had declined,” Dr. Montrose said.

Research also suggests that these effects could be cumulative, meaning that your risk can increase over time as you face more exposure. People who are frequently exposed to high levels of smoke, like some firefighters, can develop serious problems. Their lung function can decline, and they can develop higher levels of inflammation. They may also have an increased risk of lung cancer.

Researchers don’t have the data to determine whether it is more harmful to experience high levels of smoke for a short period or low levels for a long period, but they are sure of this: As the number of smoky days in the United States increases, many Americans will be at elevated risk as smoke affects them year after year.

“There’s been a shift from looking at kind of daily and weekly level exposures to looking at annual or multiyear exposure, since there are now chronically exposed communities,” said Stephanie Cleland, an environmental health scientist and assistant professor at Simon Fraser University.

How to Protect Yourself

If smoke is in the air, try to stay indoors with your windows shut, she said, especially if you have a chronic condition that puts you at higher risk. Dr. Gould recommended using an air purifier indoors if possible. (You can make one by taping a furnace filter over a box fan.)

It is not always possible to avoid going outside on smoky days. If you must, avoid strenuous exercise and wear an N95 mask.

There aren’t clear answers on when, exactly, you should avoid smoke exposure outdoors, but public health officials often issue health warnings when the A.Q.I. is over 100.

Dr. Cleland recommended that people check air-quality reports during summer and fall, the same way they might check the weather. “People tend to react if they can see, smell or feel smoke,” she said, “but health impacts happen before it reaches that level.”",smoke travels airway trunk pm25 particles travel impair lung function cause irritation people frequently exposed high levels smoke develop serious problems,the United States,,TRV,220.83450317382812,221.58497619628906,223.49075317382812,228.9415283203125,0.33983504012061405,0.8600659711924002,1.2028238168512797,3.6710862795307824

It is never too early to plan for a potential evacuation, even if you are not in an area immediately affected by smoke or flames. Wildfires can spread very quickly, move erratically and travel great distances — especially when driven by the wind, as Thursday’s fires were, experts say.

Here are some suggestions to prepare for such an emergency.

Before the fire

Make a plan. Families should set a meeting point in case they get separated and map at least two evacuation routes.

Prepare an emergency supply kit. Think beyond a flashlight, batteries, and food and water.

wildfire,What Wildfire Smoke Means for Birds,2023-08-18,https://www.nytimes.com/article/wildfire-smoke-birds.html,"Hawaii, Los Angeles","The Maui wildfires are an ongoing human tragedy. At least 111 people have died, more than 1,000 people are unaccounted for, and many have been displaced from their homes.

But such fires also put animals at risk. Wildlife, livestock and pets often perish in fires. Flames can destroy critical habitats for endangered species and set back conservation efforts. (The Hawaii fires threatened the Maui Bird Conservation Center, which is home to some of the world’s most endangered birds.) And all creatures that breathe air are susceptible to smoke.

“Birds are especially vulnerable, because they have an incredibly efficient respiratory system, which is designed to deliver enough oxygen to power flight,” said Olivia Sanderfoot, an ecologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies how smoke affects birds and other wildlife. The avian respiratory system is especially adept at drawing oxygen out of the air, but if there are pollutants wafting around, birds take those up readily, too.

Precisely how smoke affects birds is still a nascent field of research, with many unanswered questions. But studies have shown that smoke can damage birds’ lungs and make them more vulnerable to respiratory infections. And the fine particulate matter that is present in smoke — and causes well-documented health problems in humans — can also accumulate in birds’ airways. “We know that air pollution, and smoke specifically, causes respiratory distress and makes it more difficult for birds to breathe,” Dr. Sanderfoot said.",creatures breathe air susceptible smoke studies shown smoke damage birds lungs make vulnerable infections,Hawaii,,HE,12.029999732971191,13.770000457763672,13.039999961853027,13.369999885559082,14.463846744930326,-5.30138323633143,8.39567956193449,11.138821133264772

Last year’s wildfire season started ominously, with nearly one million acres burned in the sparsely populated northern portion of Alberta, forcing thousands of residents to flee in early May.

The accumulating wear and tear on the components that hold the grid together, combined with weather that has often been hotter and stormier in some regions, means the wildfires and sustained blackouts may be a preview of how an aging grid could falter spectacularly as weather becomes more extreme and demand for electricity continues to rise.

The National Academy of Engineering calls the power grid the most important innovation of the 20th century, and with the greater electrification of society it will become even more critical. The sprawling system of transmission lines, power plants and transformers connects communities across the United States. Many of the components that tie the system together — utility poles, transmission towers and power lines — haven’t been modernized or upgraded since they were built, often decades ago. The consequences of this neglect, as we have seen, can be catastrophic.

This past spring, a decayed utility pole broke in high winds in the Texas Panhandle, causing power wires to fall on dry grass and igniting the largest fire in the state’s history. Two people died and more than one million acres burned. The Maui wildfire that killed more than 100 people and destroyed the historic town of Lahaina last year began after winds knocked down power lines, also igniting dry grass.

In news conferences and alerts to residents, firefighters might rattle off figures on how many thousands of acres have burned and speak of how “red flag conditions” are fueling “extreme fire behavior” that is hampering their efforts to increase the percentage of a “complex fire” that is “contained.”

Here is a guide to help you understand some of the terms officials use when discussing wildfires:

Percent contained

When fire officials report that a fire is, say, 30 percent contained, that means that 30 percent of the blaze’s boundary is hemmed in by barriers like rivers, streams, interstate highways or areas that are already scorched, leaving no more vegetation to ignite. Other times, these containment lines are 10- to 12-foot-wide trenches that crews have dug along the fire’s edge — sometimes with bulldozers — to stop the fire from spreading.

When officials say a fire is 100 percent contained, that does not mean it has been extinguished.

As smoke from wildfires in Canada drifts over large parts of the United States, the best thing to do to prevent breathing in pollutants is to stay indoors. For many people, of course, that’s impossible. So if you do have to brave the outdoors, putting on a mask is the next best thing.

But beware, not all masks work equally well. A surgical mask, scarf or bandanna won’t do much to keep you from breathing in pollutants.

Instead, use N95 face masks, which filter 95 percent of airborne particles, according to California’s health department (you may still have some of those left from the pandemic), or respirator masks, which you can find in hardware stores or online. Make sure to cover both your nose and mouth.

“Air quality is at unhealthy levels in New York today due to wildfire smoke drifting down from Canada,” Lucky Tran, a scientist, wrote on Twitter earlier this month when the Northeast was facing dangerous levels of smoke. “Reminder that N95 masks help protect against smoke too.

Lawyers for Lahaina residents suing the utility, Hawaiian Electric, contend that its power equipment was not strong enough to withstand strong winds, and that the company should have shut down power before the winds came. Wildfire experts who have studied the catastrophic fires in California over the past two decades also see shortcomings in Hawaiian Electric’s actions.

Nearly a week after the wildfire tore through the island town of Lahaina, state and local officials have not determined a cause for the blaze that killed at least 99 people. But the explosive conditions were similar to those elsewhere in the country where wildfires were sparked by electrical equipment: dry brush, high winds and aging infrastructure.

Many wildfires in the United States occur when poles owned by utilities or other structures carrying power lines are blown down, or when branches or other objects land on power lines and cause them to produce high-energy flashes of electricity that can start fires.

Then, starting around 2016, the trajectory reversed.

That shift can be seen in the Air Quality Index, which measures the concentration of tiny particles in the air, which can be absorbed through the lungs and into the bloodstream, as well as ozone, another harmful pollutant. For almost a decade, average air-quality readings have been getting worse.

Two main causes explain that shift, according to First Street, both tied to climate change. First, more extreme heat has increased the levels of ozone in the air. Second, and more consequential: An increase in heat and drought has made wildfires worse, causing more smoke to reach more of the United States.

That can bring severe health dangers.

Inhaling the tiny particles in wildfire smoke is associated with strokes, heart disease, respiratory disease, lung cancer and early death, according to Susan Anenberg, director of the Climate and Health Institute at George Washington University. “The higher the pollution level and the longer the duration of exposure,” she said, “the more risk there is.”",1950s us air pollution began steadily improve starting around 2016 trajectory reversed air quality index measures concentration tiny particles air,the United States,,TRV,209.80946350097656,209.99530029296875,211.22775268554688,215.2869873046875,0.088574075206728,0.5868952261592071,0.675989138384938,2.6107134122124296

Central Chile has been in the grip of a prolonged drought for more than a decade. On top of these dry conditions, the region experienced an intense heat wave at the beginning of February that raised the risk of wildfires.

According to the new analysis by the group, World Weather Attribution, the probability of these conditions, specifically for the coastal region of Chile where the fires occurred, is now about 3 percent in any given year. That risk is not significantly higher than it was before human-caused climate change.

The fires hit the area around the coastal city of Viña del Mar. More than 130 people died in the fires, which destroyed more than 7,000 homes and burned more than 70,000 acres.

Long-term exposure to pollution like wildfire smoke has also been linked to an increased risk for C.O.P.D., lung cancer, type 2 diabetes and dementia, Dr. Koehle said.

These issues typically arise after years of smoke exposure. If you go on a bike ride or two in hazy weather, you’re likely to only experience short-term symptoms such as coughing, if you experience any symptoms at all. “Every once in a while is probably not going to be a big deal,” Dr. Wooldridge said, though it’s unclear exactly how much smoke exposure might cause long-term problems. It’s wise to take precautions, especially because wildfire smoke exposure is becoming more and more common.

How to interpret air quality levels

If you’re considering exercising outside, check the air quality levels in your area. Because the particles in wildfire smoke are so tiny, they aren’t always visible, Dr. Christenson said — don’t just go by what you see.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency rates air quality according to the Air Quality Index (A.Q.I.), ranging from 0 to 500. The E.P.A. considers an A.Q.I. of 151 or above unhealthy, but sensitive individuals may experience health effects at lower levels.

Dr. Koehle recommends the Plume Labs app, which includes three-day air quality forecasts as well as exercise-specific recommendations, such as whether it’s safe to run outdoors or go on a bike ride in your area. The AirVisual app also offers air quality forecasting, along with AirNow.gov, he said.",longterm exposure pollution like wildfire smoke linked increased risk copd lung cancer type 2 diabetes dementia youre considering exercising outside check air quality,the United States,,TRV,206.6052703857422,211.16732788085938,211.24630737304688,217.65489196777344,2.208103155645353,0.037401378792869054,2.2463303954636022,5.348179918838016

Kang Sun, an assistant professor at the University at Buffalo studying the chemistry and physics of the Earth’s atmosphere, said that when trees, branches and leaves — also known as biomass — are burned in wildfires, they emit gases called volatile organic compounds.

And when these compounds are first emitted, some react quickly and create that recognizable smoke smell typically associated with a campfire.

But some compounds are stable enough to travel thousands of miles downwind to Michigan and upstate New York from the fires in Canada, Dr. Sun said.

In recent years, climate change has made wildfires bigger, hotter and faster. Last year, in particular, the sheer magnitude of the conflagrations and the plumes of toxic smoke they sent billowing over thousands of miles — all during a respiratory pandemic — served as a wake-up call for many: Once fire season is underway, it’s too late to prepare.

So, although there are already fires burning in California, we thought it would be useful to help you get ready.

Climate change is one of the driving forces behind worsening fires worldwide. As the atmosphere warms, many forests and other natural ecosystems are becoming drier and more prone to catching on fire. “It’s just so clear that, sometime in the last five to 10 years, something’s changed,” said Marshall Burke, a professor of environmental policy at Stanford University and a co-author of the report that focused on the United States. “You don’t have to cook the books.”

Together, the two studies show how wildfires are a growing health threat. Wildfire smoke can contain a variety of pollutants, including fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, a type of air pollution made up of very small particles that can invade the lungs and bloodstream.

Thanks to the Clean Air Act, air pollution in the United States has generally improved since the 1970s.

The blazes have prompted hundreds of school closures across California this academic year alone, according to the state’s Department of Education.

Other disasters like hurricanes and extreme heat have similarly disrupted schooling more often in recent years as the climate changes.

In California, schools are asked to move recess and gym class indoors and reschedule outdoor athletic events when air quality is deemed “unhealthy,” under state guidance. But the decision to close school can be complex in part because “ventilation and filtration systems at schools may offer a higher level of protection than residential systems.”

Often, though, schools are left with no choice but to shut their doors when cities are covered in smoke and families flee under evacuation orders. The disasters can cause thousands of children to become homeless. In cases where homes have been destroyed, children have been forced to learn remotely or move schools as their families rebuild their lives.

As humans warm the planet, both heat waves and wildfires are becoming more severe and longer-lasting in the American West. That also means they are more likely to overlap. Researchers have estimated that two-thirds of California’s land area experienced broiling heat and heavy wildfire smoke concurrently at some point during the state’s record fire year of 2020.

Both hazards are harmful to health on their own: Heat stress increases cardiac strain, and inhaling wildfire smoke can aggravate lung conditions. The new study, led by researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, looked at the health effects when the two threats appeared in tandem.

On exceptionally hot and smoky days, staying indoors doesn’t always help, and certainly not for people who don’t have air-conditioners and air purifiers, said Tarik Benmarhnia, an environmental epidemiologist at Scripps and one of the study’s authors. “Air pollution doesn’t stay politely outside,” he said. “It gets inside, interacts with a lot of indoor air pollutants and can lead to a lot of issues.”

The Findings: Compounding harms, and unequal ones, too.

The researchers took state data on unscheduled hospitalizations between 2006 and 2019 and combined it with detailed readings of temperatures and wildfire smoke.

They found that combined exposure to the two hazards had a bigger effect on hospitalizations than the sum of the effects from each separately. In other words, the harm to health from concurrent heat and smoke was greater than the sum of its parts.

California’s agricultural heartland, the Central Valley, and its wooded far north experienced more of these hot and smoky days than other regions during the study period, the researchers found.

They also found that the size of the compounding effect from heat and smoke varied across communities with different demographics. Areas with weaker socioeconomic indicators and higher proportions of nonwhite residents had it worse.

What Might Be Next: Joint warnings for heat and smoke.

At the moment, heat advisories in California come from local offices of the National Weather Service, while hazardous air warnings are issued by local air-quality management districts.

The study’s findings suggest a joint heat-and-smoke warning would help keep more people safe, Dr. Benmarhnia said. To account for the extra danger on sweltering days, officials might also consider issuing air-quality alerts even when pollution hasn’t reached the level that would trigger a warning on cooler days, he said.

A spokeswoman for California’s Air Resources Board said the agency was preparing new educational resources this year to help residents protect themselves from concurrent heat and smoke.

In Vancouver, British Columbia, where I’ve lived for 25 years, we used to blame California and Washington for our occasionally smoky skies. Then in the summer of 2015, Vancouver’s air turned Martian orange, just as the air on the East Coast did last year. Only this time, the fires were ours. It wasn’t just a bad year; something fundamental had changed.

Red flag warnings in New England indicating fire weather — that is, hot, dry, windy conditions — have been issued repeatedly since late October. These warnings are common in the West, but they are extremely rare in the Northeast, where I grew up and where my base line was established, my notion of what normal weather is.

By creating a defensible space, or “firescaping,” residents can carve a barrier between their home and flammable vegetation. A defensible space around the perimeter of the house should be well-irrigated and free of brush, vegetation and other materials that could fuel a fire. Adding fuel breaks such as gravel walkways or driveways can also help.

If you’ve got the space, Cal Fire recommends creating a buffer, of at least several hundred feet, with fire-resistant plants and noncombustible materials, like concrete or gravel. Homeowners should also move branches, firewood and garbage to other areas around the home.

“Having defensible space does make a big difference,” said Brian Centoni, the public information officer for the Fire Department in Alameda County, Calif.

And in California, residents are required to have a “defensible space” in certain high-risk areas.

But no matter how safe you think your home may be, you must leave if the authorities order you to evacuate.

Make water sources accessible

Home hardening, a term used to describe the process of modifying a home to make it more fire-resistant, can help protect firefighters, too. The Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends plugging a garden hose into a water line so fire departments can have access to it. You should identify and maintain water sources like hydrants, ponds and pools and make sure they are accessible.

But then climate change, in a few different ways, seems to also load the dice toward more fire in the future.”

Even if the conditions are right for a wildfire, you still need something or someone to ignite it. Sometimes the trigger is nature, like the unusual lightning strikes that set off the L.N.U. Lightning Complex fires in August, but more often than not humans are responsible, said Nina S. Oakley, a research scientist at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego.

Many deadly fires have been started by downed power lines. The 2018 Carr Fire, the state’s sixth-largest on record, started when a truck blew out its tire and its rim scraped the pavement, sending out sparks. And some are started through bad decisions, like the fire that was ignited by smoke-generating fireworks as part of a gender-reveal party east of Los Angeles.

Events like gender reveal parties can trigger a blaze, Dr. Oakley noted, but “you also have the human contribution to wildfire,” which includes the warming that has been caused by greenhouse gas emissions and the accompanying increased drying. Both contribute “to creating a situation favorable to wildfire,” she said.

“California has a lot of people and a really long dry season,” Dr. Williams said. “People are always creating possible sparks, and as the dry season wears on and stuff is drying out more and more, the chance that a spark comes off a person at the wrong time just goes up. And that’s putting aside arson.”",2018 car fire states sixthlargest record started truck blew tire pretty much every single way perfect recipe fire kind written california,California,,PCG,8.885785102844238,9.035041809082031,9.084794998168945,9.064892768859863,1.679724464527255,0.550669162780211,2.239643351953293,2.0156650643992577

They are now in their second weekend thousands of kilometers away from their homes, businesses and, for those who can’t work remotely, jobs. While sprinkler systems and continual forest clearing have kept the fire more or less 15 kilometers from the city, its threat remains.

The proposed agreement was filed late Friday in a Maui-based state court, six days before the anniversary of the disaster. Fire victims and insurers have spent months in court-ordered mediation with the state, Maui County, large private landowners and utilities within the fire zone to resolve more than 600 lawsuits brought in state and federal courts by survivors of the catastrophe.

The settlement, which remains subject to court approval, will cover less than half of the overall cost of the disaster — estimated at nearly $12 billion — which cut a path of destruction through one of the world’s most spectacularly beautiful destinations.

Credit Credit... Ringo H.W. Chiu/Associated Press

A summer of unrelenting heat in the western United States and Canada hit the Northern Rockies this weekend, where temperatures reached the upper 90s and lower 100s with a heat wave that is expected to peak on Monday but ease only slightly through the week.

It was the fourth major heat wave to afflict parts of the West since early June, bringing dangerously hot temperatures and helping fuel the deepening drought and exploding wildfires across the region.

An excessive heat warning will remain in effect for parts of Montana through Tuesday night, according to the National Weather Service. Billings, in the south of the state, reached 106 on Monday while Glasgow, a town toward the north, hit 109 degrees. Temperatures will fall just a few degrees as the week progresses, delivering minimal relief from the sweltering heat.

Salt Lake City hit 104 degrees on Sunday, tying the daily record set in 1960, meteorologists said; it was the 17th time this year that the city hit 100 degrees or higher. Monsoonal rain was expected through the region and forecast to continue spreading northward across all of Utah and southwest Wyoming on Monday, bringing relief to some areas.

Several areas around Boise, Idaho, hit the 100-degree mark on Sunday, and meteorologists forecast cloud cover and thunderstorm chances to increase Monday through Wednesday, which may lower maximum temperatures by a few degrees.

The soaring temperatures have made wildfire season particularly dangerous. A rapidly spreading wildfire just south of Lake Tahoe in California exploded over the weekend, prompting evacuations of several communities. Windy and dry conditions fueled the growth of the Bootleg Fire in Oregon over the weekend, prompting an increase in evacuations. On Monday, thunderstorms were forecast to add to the risk, fire officials said. “We are running firefighting operations through the day and all through the night,” Joe Hessel, a commander with the Oregon Department of Forestry’s incident team, said in a statement on Monday. “This fire is a real challenge, and we are looking at sustained battle for the foreseeable future.” The fire, the largest of dozens in the United States, has burned more than 343,000 acres in southwest Oregon and is 25 percent contained. The size of the fire is about 467 square miles or roughly the size of Los Angeles, fire officials said. “The weather is really against us,” John Flannigan, the operations section chief, said at a news briefing on Sunday. “It’s going to be hot, it’s going to be dry, and the air’s going to be unstable, which helps the heat raise faster, which brings in more air. All things that are negative for firefighters and positive for fire.” Triple-digit temperatures that roasted the Pacific Northwest in late June and early July killed hundreds of people in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia. The event, the result of a heat dome, would have been all but impossible without climate change, according to a team of researchers. As for the wildfires that are spreading across the west, half are initiated by lightning and half are caused by humans. They are frequently started by power lines, cigarettes, cars, camp fires or arson. In recent years, there has been an abundance of very dry fuel. Drought and high heat can kill trees and dry out dead grass, pine needles and any other material on the bottom of the forest floor that act as kindling when a fire sweeps through a forest. Wildfire experts see the signature of climate change in the dryness, high heat and longer fire season that have made these fires more extreme.

They ask only to be allowed to help themselves in the face of failing emergency services and federal aid. But the entrenched vulnerabilities produced by colonialism are not so easily overcome. For example, some residents have been begging tourists to stay away as the community recovers. But others have said that as much as they would like the time to mourn, they simply can’t afford it — especially when all they have received from the government is $700. This is what happens when your economy hinges on the pleasure of others.

Maui residents who were already being pushed out by unaffordable housing prices and a lack of career opportunities beyond hospitality will now probably feel the same push to migrate that Puerto Ricans did after Hurricane Maria. It will only worsen if weeks of absent federal aid turn into months of bureaucratic labyrinths and endless red tape, as has happened so often. Here again I think about how after Hurricane Maria only 40 percent of FEMA applicants received any aid at all and a little over 1 percent received the maximum payout.

The challenge of repairing damaged homes without adequate support — as well as persistent power outages, deteriorating bridges and a failing health system — has made it increasingly difficult for Puerto Ricans to stay put. This has combined with the influx of digital nomads and federal tax-evading millionaires, along with a growing Airbnb market that has priced many people out of their own communities.

The State of Hawaii has said it will protect locals from land speculators. But if the bureaucracy of emergency management stalls out or fails, people who have temporary hotel vouchers or are overstaying their welcome on their cousins’ couches will be left with few options other than to sell.

The damage to oil and gas production was likely to significantly surpass current tallies, Thomas Liles, vice president of Rystad’s upstream research, said in a note. A large part of Alberta’s shale gas producing regions remained under “extreme” or “very high” wildfire warnings. Another 2.7 million barrels a day of oil sands production was also at risk.

The disruptions from the fires in Canada, a major oil- and gas-producing nation, have helped push oil prices higher. Chevron said it had shut down all production at its Kaybob Duvernay oil and gas fields in central Alberta. Paramount temporarily shuttered a natural gas processing plant along with production in several gas fields, the company said in its latest update on Sunday. Both companies said they were prioritizing the safety of their workers.

Background: Oil and gas are also vulnerable to climate change.

It isn’t the first time Canada’s oil and gas fields have been hit by fires, and the shutdowns, for now, affect a small proportion of the country’s total oil and gas output. Still, they underscore how the production of oil and gas, the main driver of climate change, is also vulnerable to the increasingly dire consequences of a warming planet.

As climate change intensifies, the risk of devastating wildfires around the world will surge, the United Nations warned in a landmark report last year. Researchers found that in regions with long histories of wildfires, like the western United States and Canada, the burning has become larger and more intense over the last decade.

The fires come amid a multiyear drought and much warmer temperatures than are normal in western Canada, which climate scientists attribute to climate change. And in recent years, Alberta has been more affected by climate-related disasters than almost any other part of the country, including severe floods in 2013, a previous round of devastating wildfires in 2016 and thunderstorms that brought billions of dollars in damage in 2018.

While it’s hard to say how much climate disasters will affect Canada’s oil and gas industry, the country can expect more shutdowns, said Ryan Ness, director of adaptation research at the nonprofit Canadian Climate Institute.

“Canada is in a difficult situation in that the oil and gas industry has been a very important part of our economy for a long time,” Mr. Ness said. “But the reality is that the world has to shift away from fossil fuels and meet our greenhouse emissions targets, or else the types of extreme weather and wildfires and the like we’re seeing will just become unsurvivable.”",large part albertas shale gas producing regions remained extreme high wildfire warnings chevron said shut production kaybob duvernay oil,Canada,,IFC.TO,192.75672912597656,192.89105224609375,193.67774963378906,192.47850036621094,0.06968530786253399,0.4078454539672635,0.47781497018999797,-0.14434191793314152

Several Western wildfires were raging at once. In California, San Bernardino County was in a state of emergency; the nearby Bridge fire had destroyed 54 structures, stretching the state’s resources thin. Smoldering fires were reigniting across Washington and Oregon, and the Davis fire bore down on ski resorts near Reno, Nev., burning 14 structures. There wasn’t a single elite operations unit available — the kind you call in to manage major wildfires.

Cooler temperatures have brought some relief, but at any moment fire conditions might sweep back in, as they often do in California in September.

In the era of climate change and forest mismanagement, it’s tempting to shrug one’s shoulders and presume that firefighter shortages are inevitable. But it doesn’t have to be this way.

Unlike urban firefighters, wildland firefighters are specially trained to take on the wildfires that plague the West. For years, those employed by the federal government have complained about profound levels of attrition driven by poor pay, increasingly exhausting working conditions and a lack of mental health support.

It’s early June, the temperature is 97 degrees Fahrenheit and the air shimmers over dead trees choked in brush. In the Stanislaus National Forest, logging roads wind through firs and ponderosa pines, past 20-foot-tall burn piles — tons of scrap wood not worth bringing to a sawmill. They’ve been assembled by workers on the front line of the fight against forest fires: a timber crew thinning these woods for the U.S. Forest Service and a tech start-up that’s trying to automate the enormous machines the crew relies on.

They are called skidders: 10-foot-tall vehicles, on four massive wheels, with a bulldozer-like blade on the front and a tree-size grapple dangling from the back. They are the worker bees, hauling downed logs from the forest to landing sites where they are delimbed and loaded onto trucks bound for the sawmill. Usually, a single driver operates them for a 12-hour shift, grabbing logs from behind and then driving forward.

Engineers at the Sonora, Calif., start-up Kodama Systems, a forest management company, have hacked into a skidder built by Caterpillar, studded it with cameras and radar and plugged it into the internet. The result is a remote-controlled machine that does scut work for a timber crew and teaches itself to operate semiautonomously, using LiDar — or light detection and ranging — to map the forest.",skidders 10fotal vehicles four massive wheels buldozerlike blade front tresize grapple dangling back usually single driver operates,Calif.,,PCG,19.53700828552246,19.636688232421875,19.87591552734375,20.364341735839844,0.5102109055933607,1.2182670116791383,1.7346936484253326,4.234698773867353

Now more catastrophic fires were underway, and Phillip and Claire didn’t trust the local government’s ability to respond. They believed their house could withstand any worst-case scenario, but lately they had also begun to wonder about the toll that exacted on them.

Phillip, 48, went outside and hiked into the gullies to cut away brush and chaparral until there was nothing flammable left within several hundred feet of the house. The property spanned 80 acres, and on a clear day he could see 50 miles in every direction, from Catalina Island to the snow-capped peaks of the San Gabriel Mountains. Some of the nearby houses belonged to reclusive celebrities or billionaires who lived elsewhere and visited every few months, but the Vogts had invested everything in their house — their time, ambitions and life savings. They were married on the land when it was just a construction site, and then they spent about $3 million building much of it themselves. Their plan was to turn the property into an event site for weddings and retreats. They planted a cork oak near the top of the hill, where Phillip told Claire to spread his ashes when he died.

Phillip’s phone dinged with another emergency alert. “Extreme Red Flag Fire Warning,” it read. “Remain vigilant and prepare to evacuate.” He walked back toward the house, inspected the fire hose and tried on his protective firefighting goggles.

Mr. Centoni said that when evacuation orders for the S.C.U. Lightning Complex were issued in mid-August it meant to leave home as soon as possible in order to save lives.

Make water sources accessible

Home hardening, a term used to describe the process of modifying a home to make it more fire-resistant, can help protect firefighters too. The Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends plugging a garden hose into a water line so fire departments can have access to it. You should identify and maintain water sources like hydrants, ponds and pools and make sure they are accessible. You can also ensure that your driveway is clear for emergency vehicles and make sure your address signs are clearly visible from the road.

California has some of the strictest building codes in the nation and new homes are required to be constructed with certain fire-resistant materials. Some have taken to building homes entirely out of flameproof materials.

Clear your roof and gutters

FEMA recommends regularly clearing your roof and gutters of dry leaves and other debris. To prevent embers from flying in, enclose or box in eaves, soffits, decks and other openings in the home’s structure; fine wire mesh can be used to cover vents, crawl spaces and the area underneath porches and decks. A defensible space around the perimeter of the house should be well-irrigated and free of brush, vegetation and other materials that could fuel a fire. Adding fuel breaks such as gravel walkways or driveways can also help.

The new study looked at the total power emitted by clusters of fire events, defined as fires burning at the same time in proximity, or in the same spot, at multiple times in a single day. The researchers analyzed 21 years of data collected by two NASA satellites between January 2003 and November 2023 to quantify how fire activity has changed over time.

They identified 2,913 extreme events out of more than 30 million fires across the world. Such extreme fire events were also defined by the vast amount of smoke they emitted, their high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, which can further accelerate global warming, and the fire’s ecological, social, and economic effects.

Climate change is causing rising temperatures and longer droughts, which together have made wildfires more frequent and devastating. This year’s wildfires, including the Palisades fire near Los Angeles, are expected to be even worse than usual, because much of the West has been stuck in an unusually bad drought.

As that risk grows, the Agriculture Department, which oversees the U.S. Forest Service, said it must double or even quadruple the amount of vegetation it removes from its forests each year. That leaves less fuel for fires that do ignite, making them easier to contain.

The amount of vegetation being removed each year “is not enough to keep pace with the scale and scope of the wildfire problem,” the department wrote. It called for treating an additional 20 million acres on National Forest System land by 2040, as well as 30 million acres on other federal, state, tribal and private land.",climate change causing rising temperatures longer droughts years wildfires expected even worse usual agriculture department says must double even quadruple amount vegetation removes,Los Angeles,,TRV,144.51455688476562,146.1806182861328,146.4291229248047,146.9998321533203,1.1528675292522172,0.16999834970286823,1.3248257347290744,1.7197404345476557

Wednesday was another exhausting, sad and outright disturbing day in California as fires continued to tear across the West, killing a 1-year-old boy in Washington, at least three people in Oregon and three more in Butte County. Towns have been destroyed. Skies over the Bay Area turned a shade of orange that can only be described as hellish.

[Read the latest updates here.]

Today, we’re taking a step back and answering some questions you may have:

How did the wildfires start?

Most of the fires in California are caused by people, like the El Dorado Fire, which has grown to more than 10,000 acres and which you have probably heard by now was ignited when a family used a “pyrotechnic device” at a gender-reveal party.

Many others are caused by more mundane human actions, like driving a car that sends soot into dry vegetation, as was the case with the Apple Fire in Southern California this year.

Re “Disastrous Wave of Climate Events Slams California” (front page, Sept. 11):

I sit here in Southern California about 50 miles from the nearest catastrophic wildfire, watching the ash fall from the sky while those in the north are seeing something more apocalyptic. Yes, there is a link between climate change and what is happening across the United States.

With the election looming I cannot help but wonder how science and fact-based research are ignored in the face of significantly increased hurricane activity, relocations of entire communities because of repeated flooding, and record heat followed by snow in Colorado.

We cannot continue to call these 100-year events because they are happening more frequently. The Trump administration has issued a report that shows the impact to financial markets. Will it be the wake-up call our country needs? It comes from an administration that is not focused on the environment.

“It was a bit of a leap,” he says. “It was a risk. But it also felt like, given the role that fire is increasingly playing in our world now, it really deserved to be focused on, on its own merit, from its own point of view, if you will.”

Connecticut and New Jersey have imposed statewide burn bans, which restrict outdoor fires. In New York, municipalities are making their own decisions about such restrictions.

Wildfires in New York State have been fewer and smaller, with one of the largest this week spanning 12 acres near Ithaca, according to a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Conservation. Although wildfires have been more contained in the state, New York City, which has had an unseasonably warm fall, is on high alert.

Make water sources accessible

Home hardening, the process of modifying a home to make it more fire-resistant, can help protect firefighters too. The Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends plugging a garden hose into a water line so fire departments can have access to it. You should identify and maintain water sources like hydrants, ponds and pools and make sure they are accessible. You can also ensure that your driveway is clear for emergency vehicles and that your address signs are clearly visible from the road.

California has some of the strictest building codes in the nation, and new homes are required to be constructed with certain fire-resistant materials. Some have taken to building homes entirely out of flameproof materials.

Clear your roof and gutters

FEMA recommends regularly clearing your roof and gutters of dry leaves and other debris. To prevent embers from flying in, enclose or box in eaves, soffits, decks and other openings in the home’s structure; fine wire mesh can be used to cover vents, crawl spaces and the area underneath porches and decks. A defensible space around the perimeter of the house should be well-irrigated and free of brush, vegetation and other materials that could fuel a fire. Adding fuel breaks such as gravel walkways or driveways can also help.

The fires are controlled, kindled in a research lab or staged at training facilities used by fire departments. They are designed to simulate the conditions that help wildfires spread through neighborhoods and cause what the insurers call a “conflagration event,” like the one that killed 102 people and destroyed the town of Lahaina on Maui in Hawaii last August.

The message to homebuilders is stark: Homes in certain parts of the United States must now be constructed with wildfires in mind, or they most likely will not be insured, which would mean they couldn’t be bought with a mortgage.

In part because of climate change and the resulting increase in catastrophic storms and fires, insuring homes in some parts of the country has become a money-losing proposition for the industry. Across the United States, insurers lost $33 billion in 2023 on personal home and auto insurance, according to AM Best, a ratings agency for the industry.

In California, where fires have consumed more than roughly 220,000 acres of land in just this year, major insurers like State Farm, Allstate and Farmers have all pulled back. In some areas, they have stopped writing new policies and have canceled some existing policies.

On Aug. 8, wildfires raged across the Hawaiian island of Maui, growing rapidly into a fast-moving inferno that leveled the historic town of Lahaina and killed at least 100 people. It was the deadliest blaze to occur in the United States in more than a century. Tourism, which powers the island’s economy, came to an abrupt halt as many locals discouraged visitors to any part of Maui in the wake of the disaster. The state of Hawaii ended all travel restrictions to Maui by early October, but visitor spending and arrivals has been slow to return.

Marilyn Clark is a travel agent who specializes in trips to Hawaii and said she had a handful of clients cancel their vacations to Maui or rebook to other islands in the immediate aftermath of the fires. And bookings for the December holiday season — typically Maui’s busiest and the period those in the industry have pinned their hopes on — are down.

“The major concern for most potential visitors is that they will not be welcome,” Ms. Clark said.

September

In September, as Morocco was preparing for a post-pandemic tourism boom during its high travel season, it was struck by a powerful 6.8-magnitude earthquake southwest of Marrakesh. The quake killed thousands of people, destroyed hundreds of villages and left many travelers in a conundrum over how to respond.

With most of the destruction concentrated in rural areas far from tourism spots, many locals encouraged travelers to visit, arguing that their tourism revenue would help efforts to rebuild areas that were hit the hardest.

“We were extremely worried about mass cancellations and if that happened, it would have added to our wounds from the earthquake,” said Aimad Kamal, a local tour guide. “We are so grateful to everyone who recognized everything our beautiful country has to offer even during a time of tragedy.”",aug 8 wildfires raged across hawaiian island maui tourism powers islands economy came abrupt halt state hawaii ended travel restrictions maui early october,the United States,,TRV,182.10873413085938,179.8199005126953,181.5120849609375,185.1898651123047,-1.2568499962881277,0.941044035402922,-0.3276334728092371,1.691918290547931

Wildfires have killed more than 120 people as they swept the forested hillsides of Chile, and record-breaking rains have swelled rivers and triggered mudslides in Southern California.

Behind these risks are two powerful forces: Climate change, which can intensify both rain and drought, and the natural weather phenomenon known as El Niño, which can also supersize extreme weather.

In California, meteorologists had been warning for days that an unusually strong storm, known as an atmospheric river, was gathering force because of extraordinarily high Pacific Ocean temperatures. The rains began over the weekend and several counties were under a state of emergency. By Monday, officials warned that the Los Angeles area could be deluged by the equivalent of a year’s rainfall in a single day.

In the southern hemisphere, Chile has been reeling from drought for the better part of a decade. That set the stage for a hellish weekend, when, amid a severe heat wave, wildfires broke out.

When Nancy Morales moved to Hawaii from Mexico City more than two decades ago to escape crime and grinding poverty, she figured she would stay for a few years, make some money and go home. But after two children and a divorce, she couldn’t fathom being a single mother in Mexico, so she built a life on Maui, in the historic town of Lahaina.

It took two jobs, cleaning hotel rooms and making banana bread at a local bakery, and it meant living with the fact that she was undocumented. But she found a measure of happiness: peace, community, beautiful sunsets and an apartment near the Pacific Ocean.

Now even that modest bit of paradise is in jeopardy, after the wildfire that ravaged Lahaina in August and killed 99 people. As the wind-stoked blaze bore down, Ms. Morales barely survived the traffic-choked streets. She soon found herself living in the hotel where she worked.

Much of the forest canopy had been removed, exposing the remaining vegetation to more direct sunlight and creating hotter, drier and windier conditions that favor the spread of flames.

But when the blaze reached the area hit by the Ferguson fire of 2018, it slowed to burning about 1,000 acres a day. The previous fire had left less available kindling such as dry leaves, pine needles, twigs and saplings on the forest floor.

A summer of unrelenting heat in the western United States and Canada hit the Northern Rockies this weekend, where temperatures reached the upper 90s and lower 100s with a heat wave that is expected to peak on Monday but ease only slightly through the week.

It was the fourth major heat wave to afflict parts of the West since early June, bringing dangerously hot temperatures and helping fuel the deepening drought and exploding wildfires across the region.

An excessive heat warning will remain in effect for parts of Montana through Tuesday night, according to the National Weather Service. Billings, in the south of the state, reached 106 on Monday while Glasgow, a town toward the north, hit 109 degrees. Temperatures will fall just a few degrees as the week progresses, delivering minimal relief from the sweltering heat.

Salt Lake City hit 104 degrees on Sunday, tying the daily record set in 1960, meteorologists said; it was the 17th time this year that the city hit 100 degrees or higher. Monsoonal rain was expected through the region and forecast to continue spreading northward across all of Utah and southwest Wyoming on Monday, bringing relief to some areas.

Several areas around Boise, Idaho, hit the 100-degree mark on Sunday, and meteorologists forecast cloud cover and thunderstorm chances to increase Monday through Wednesday, which may lower maximum temperatures by a few degrees.

The soaring temperatures have made wildfire season particularly dangerous. A rapidly spreading wildfire just south of Lake Tahoe in California exploded over the weekend, prompting evacuations of several communities. Windy and dry conditions fueled the growth of the Bootleg Fire in Oregon over the weekend, prompting an increase in evacuations. On Monday, thunderstorms were forecast to add to the risk, fire officials said. “We are running firefighting operations through the day and all through the night,” Joe Hessel, a commander with the Oregon Department of Forestry’s incident team, said in a statement on Monday. “This fire is a real challenge, and we are looking at sustained battle for the foreseeable future.” The fire, the largest of dozens in the United States, has burned more than 343,000 acres in southwest Oregon and is 25 percent contained. The size of the fire is about 467 square miles or roughly the size of Los Angeles, fire officials said. “The weather is really against us,” John Flannigan, the operations section chief, said at a news briefing on Sunday. “It’s going to be hot, it’s going to be dry, and the air’s going to be unstable, which helps the heat raise faster, which brings in more air. All things that are negative for firefighters and positive for fire.” Triple-digit temperatures that roasted the Pacific Northwest in late June and early July killed hundreds of people in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia. The event, the result of a heat dome, would have been all but impossible without climate change, according to a team of researchers. As for the wildfires that are spreading across the west, half are initiated by lightning and half are caused by humans. They are frequently started by power lines, cigarettes, cars, camp fires or arson. In recent years, there has been an abundance of very dry fuel. Drought and high heat can kill trees and dry out dead grass, pine needles and any other material on the bottom of the forest floor that act as kindling when a fire sweeps through a forest. Wildfire experts see the signature of climate change in the dryness, high heat and longer fire season that have made these fires more extreme.

So far this year, fires have ravaged 37 million acres across nearly every Canadian province and territory. That’s more than twice as large as the amount of Canadian land that burned in any other year on record. Tens of thousands of people — including most of Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories — have fled their homes. Smoke has turned the air toxic in cities as far south as Atlanta.

Wildfires can be ignited by lightning or human-related causes such as unattended campfires, downed power lines and arson. The way fires spread and grow is shaped by the structure and composition of the forests and landscape. But heat, rain and snow affect how flammable the trees and brush are, which can determine how intensely blazes burn and how tough they are to put out.

In an analysis issued Tuesday, researchers with the World Weather Attribution initiative estimated that eastern Canada now had a 4 to 5 percent chance, in any given year, of experiencing high-fire-risk conditions as severe or worse than this year’s. This likelihood is at least double what it would be in a hypothetical world without human-caused climate change, they said.

But as fires continue to ravage Los Angeles, one call to curtail the celebrating came from Jean Smart, the “Hacks” star who won a Globe for best actress in a television comedy on Sunday night.

“With ALL due respect during Hollywood’s season of celebration,” Smart wrote on Instagram, “I hope any of the networks televising the upcoming awards will seriously consider NOT televising them and donating the revenue they would have gathered to victims of the fires and the firefighters.”

Already, the awards-season calendar has been slightly reshuffled as a response to the fires: The Critics Choice Awards, set to be televised this Sunday, were pushed back two weeks, while the announcement of the Oscar nominations was pushed back from Jan. 17 to Jan. 19. Nominations set to be unveiled this week by the producers, writers and cinematographers guilds were also delayed several days. (The Screen Actors Guild went ahead with its nominations on Wednesday but opted not to televise them as planned. The Directors Guild nominations were announced via news release as usual.)

But could the continuing disaster affect the Oscars telecast, which is set for March 2?

Though the Academy Awards have never been outright canceled, current events have sometimes forced a postponement.

wildfire,Know your risks. Then prepare.,2022-05-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/climate/climate-wildfire-risk.html,California,"It’s unlikely that people will abandon homes in even the most fire-prone areas, and it’s probably unnecessary, for now. State and local officials can use this new data to prioritize where they spend scarce dollars to reduce risk. In some places, that could mean thinning out nearby forests and other vegetation that act as fuel. Elsewhere, it could be making sure firefighters have the equipment they need. In other places, it could mean making sure roads are accessible to get people out and fire trucks in.

If I own a home in one of these areas, what can I do and how much will it cost me?

Unlike flood-proofing your home, which often means elevating the structure at a cost of $100,000 or more, reducing your exposure to fires doesn’t need to be prohibitively expensive. If you have a wood roof, think about replacing it with a material less likely to combust. If you have single-pane windows, consider getting double, to make it harder for embers to break through. Create what’s called “defensible space” around your home by removing anything within five feet of the structure that can catch fire. You can find more tips here.

California has a statewide building code for new homes built in fire-hazard areas. It includes things like defensible space, double-pane windows and noncombustible roofs. But what if I’m a renter?

A renter has fewer options. First, be careful about where you rent, and buy renters’ insurance. If you have to leave your home because of a fire, the level of federal assistance depends on whether state officials seek a federal disaster declaration, whether the federal government grants it, and then, on what type of aid the government provides. Renters forced out of their homes may qualify for help from FEMA. Don’t count on it.

Second, assess your risks now. If you live in a fire-prone area and worry your landlord isn’t taking that threat seriously, consider asking your local Fire Department for an assessment. Inform your landlord. Remember, she or he has a financial incentive to reduce those risks. Insurance may not cover the entire cost of rebuilding after a fire.",california statewide building code new homes built firehazard areas includes things like defensible space doublepane windows noncombustible roofs renters forced homes may qualify help,California,,PCG,11.731623649597168,12.04008960723877,11.831130027770996,12.099793434143066,2.629354357546182,-1.735531763336232,0.8481893141640705,3.138267946044624

Trump offered fresh criticism early Sunday of the officials in charge of fighting the Los Angeles wildfires, calling them “incompetent” and asking why the blazes were not yet extinguished.

“The fires are still raging in L.A.,” Mr. Trump wrote on his Truth Social site. “The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out.”

Mr. Trump’s comments indicated that the fires, and officials’ response to them, will likely occupy a prominent place on his domestic political agenda when he takes office on Jan. 20. He has renewed a longstanding feud with California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, who in turn has accused Mr. Trump of politicizing the fires.

Mr. Newsom told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that he had invited Mr. Trump to visit “in the spirit of an open hand, not a closed fist,” but had yet to receive a response. The governor said he was taking seriously threats by the president-elect to withhold disaster assistance. If he were to do so, Mr. Newsom said, Mr. Trump would be in effect “threatening our first responders.”

California politicians have faced criticism since the fires broke out on Tuesday, including questions over how local and state authorities had prepared for them and how they have grown so quickly into huge blazes.

Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles had to contend with questions about whether there was adequate warning about the likelihood of devastating fires, and why there was a shortage of water and firefighters during the initial response. At a news conference on Thursday, she avoided a question about her absence from the city when the fires began — she was in Ghana on a previously scheduled official visit — and said that any evaluation of mistakes or failures by “any body, department, individual” would come later.

Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, has also fended off criticism from Mr. Trump, who blamed him for the failure to contain the fires and claimed he had blocked an infusion of water to Southern California over concerns about how it would affect a threatened fish species.

Mr. Newsom’s press office responded by saying in a statement that the “water restoration declaration” that Mr. Trump had accused him of not signing did not exist. “The governor is focused on protecting people, not playing politics, and making sure firefighters have all the resources they need,” the statement said.

Mr. Newsom and Kathryn Barger, the chair of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, have invited Mr. Trump to tour fire damage in the city. He has not responded publicly to those invitations.

At least 16 people had died as a result of the fires as of Sunday morning, and at least 12,000 structures had been destroyed, officials said. Mr. Trump alluded to that devastation in his post on Sunday.

“Thousands of magnificent houses are gone, and many more will soon be lost,” he wrote. “There is death all over the place. This is one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country. They just can’t put out the fires. What’s wrong with them?”

His post did not mention any officials by name.

It’s too soon to know the financial cost of the wildfires burning around Los Angeles. But the toll on California’s troubled insurance market could be enormous.

The fires struck just as California officials have been working to stop insurance companies from fleeing their state. That exodus, driven by rising losses from wildfires that have grown larger and more frequent, could accelerate because of this week’s fires, experts said.

“The California insurance market has been balanced on a knife edge,” said Nancy Watkins, an insurance expert and principal actuary at Milliman, a consulting firm. As homeowners begin filing claims, insurers that cover large numbers of dwellings in Southern California could see a drain on their financial reserves, forcing them to drop customers, be punished by investors or exit the state.

Wildfire smoke contains high levels of the smallest, most dangerous type of soot known as PM 2.5.

Researchers at Harvard University estimated that there were nearly 20,000 extra coronavirus infections and 750 Covid-19 deaths associated with exposure to wildfire smoke between March and December 2020 in the American West. The paper was published Friday in the journal Science Advances.

Exposure to smoke, whether from air pollution or cigarette smoke, is believed to impair the function of white blood cells in the lungs, blunting the body’s immune response. The chemicals in particulate matter can also inflame cells lining the airways and lungs. In both cases, if the body is exposed to a virus in addition to air pollution, the immune response may be slowed and the person may develop a more severe illness than they would have otherwise, researchers say.

The findings build on the well-established connection between air pollution and respiratory-tract infections and conditions such as asthma.

But the real influence of climate change on the recent fire season in Australia is greater, he added. “We think it is much larger than that, but we can’t prove that until we find out why there is this discrepancy between the observations and the climate models.”",humancaused climate change impact australias recent devastating wildfires researchers found highrisk conditions led widespread burning least 30 percent likely world without global warming,Australia,,QBE.AX,11.335190773010254,11.020322799682617,10.99424934387207,8.891002655029297,-2.777791566396532,-0.23659430204075135,-3.007813771868621,-21.56283177695351

Working quickly, she managed to guide her 125 cattle into the irrigated field surrounding her home three hours east of Seattle. After that day, Ms. Linville resolved she would never go through an experience like that again.

Ms. Linville is one of a growing number of Americans across the rural west who are taking fire management into their own hands: buying surplus fire trucks, construction rigs and converted military vehicles online to protect their homes and land. Some have maintained fire defenses for decades. Others were spurred by a close call with a recent wildfire.

Many professional firefighters look warily on the movement, concerned it may give untrained homeowners a false sense of security, especially when residents disregard evacuation orders to stay and fight fires.

Deputy Chief Nick Schuler, a spokesman for Cal Fire, California’s firefighting agency, put it starkly: “A person who has a gun and can fly in a helicopter doesn’t make them trained for war.

But he cautioned that the United States was years behind in developing a strategy to combat the worsening fires and their underlying causes, including climate change.

“The fact is, we’re playing catch-up,” Mr. Biden said during a virtual meeting with leaders of Western states, adding that he was surprised at the absence of federal attention to the details of firefighting when he came to office. “Right now we have to act, and act fast.”

But many of the proposals Mr. Biden discussed — including a permanent raise for federal firefighters to roughly $15 an hour, early satellite detection of fires and better firefighting equipment — were unlikely to be ready for the wildfire season that has already begun in parts of the West, a senior administration official acknowledged on Wednesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity.",biden says us years behind developing strategy combat worsening fires many proposals discussed unlikely ready wildfire season,the United States,,TRV,138.40248107910156,138.57833862304688,140.54075622558594,137.47683715820312,0.12706242155066869,1.4161070352251244,1.5449687966664996,-0.6688058723234893

In Louisiana, the top insurance official says the market is in crisis, and is offering millions of dollars in subsidies to try to draw insurers to the state.

And in much of Florida, homeowners are increasingly struggling to buy storm coverage. Most big insurers have pulled out of the state already, sending homeowners to smaller private companies that are straining to stay in business — a possible glimpse into California’s future if more big insurers leave.

Growing ‘catastrophe exposure’

State Farm, which insures more homeowners in California than any other company, said it would stop accepting applications for most types of new insurance policies in the state because of “rapidly growing catastrophe exposure.”

The company said that while it recognized the work of California officials to reduce losses from wildfires, it had to stop writing new policies “to improve the company’s financial strength.” A State Farm spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

But Mr. Biden’s record on wildfires, which includes more pay for firefighters and more money to harden communities against blazes, demonstrates a worrying truth, experts say: There are limits to what the federal government can do to reduce the scale and destructive power of the fires, at least in the short term.

“Climate change impacts can’t be absolved in a single year,” said Roy Wright, who was in charge of risk mitigation at the Federal Emergency Management Agency until 2018. The goal, he said, should be “investments that will pay back over the coming three to five years.”

Federal action largely depends on Congress approving new funding — but even if approved, that money might not make much of a difference anytime soon, as Zolan Kanno-Youngs and I wrote this week.

The multiple fires in greater Los Angeles have produced only two deaths so far, somewhat mercifully. But the windstorm is expected to continue, and already much of Pacific Palisades has burned to an unrecognizable gray.

A decade ago, this kind of disaster seemed unthinkably rare. In retrospect, Canada’s 2016 Fort McMurray disaster, which formed the basis of John Vaillant’s book “Fire Weather,” was the beginning of a frightening new era. Then came Santa Rosa, Paradise, Boulder and Lahaina — the deadliest North American fire in more than a century, if one that now hardly stands out in cultural memory against the other scars of urban firestorms. In neighborhoods like these, often far from the wildland-urban interface, it’s almost impossible to clear enough brush to make homes defensible, as the wildfire expert Zeke Lunder noted on Tuesday. The homes provide the fuel, and the fires jump from house to house.

These years of fire have also initiated a set of arguments about its driving factors — to what extent the new disaster landscape is the result of climate conditions or fuel buildup from decades of fire suppression and to what extent building and population patterns have pushed more people into the path of fire. At times like this, for better or for worse, those arguments and their policy implications feel less urgent than the sheer scale of the wreckage and the simple and obvious lesson: We are not prepared.

“There’s no number of helicopters or trucks that we can buy, no number of firefighters that we can have, no amount of brush that we can clear that will stop this,” Eric Garcetti, then the mayor of Los Angeles, told me in 2019. “The only thing that will stop this is when the earth, probably long after we’re gone, relaxes into a more predictable weather state.”",decade ago kind disaster seemed unthinkably rare neighborhoods like almost impossible clear enough brush make homes defensible,Canada,,IFC.TO,256.99560546875,259.1553039550781,257.164794921875,253.96005249023438,0.8403639752473272,-0.7680757456340385,0.06583359774436805,-1.1811692160956972

The deal requires the power company to begin compensating, as early as August, those who lost homes, businesses and other property. About 70,000 wildfire victims filed claims. For the deal to win approval, at least two-thirds of those voting had to support it.

The vote helps clear one of the last major hurdles PG&E faces in restructuring its debts. The company is trying to resolve its bankruptcy by June 30 to qualify for a $20 billion wildfire fund created by California lawmakers. That fund will help cover the cost of future fires caused by utility equipment.

“PG&E believes that it remains on track” to meet the deadline, the company said Monday.

Facing an estimated $30 billion in wildfire liabilities, PG&E sought bankruptcy protection last year. Its equipment has set scores of fires in recent years, including the most devastating wildfire in California history, the Camp Fire in 2018, which killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise.

Where There Is Smoke …

Before deciding whether to exercise outside, we should know what inhaled smoke may do to our insides. The details are not reassuring.

Inhaling large volumes of wildfire smoke can inflame lungs, says Jennifer Stowell, a postdoctoral associate at Boston University’s School of Public Health, who has studied the health effects of wildfires.

The Palisades fire alone appears to have destroyed as many as 5,316 structures in West Los Angeles, according to fire officials who conducted an aerial survey of the region, which would make it the state’s third most destructive on record. The Eaton fire, northeast of Los Angeles, destroyed as many as 5,000 structures, a number that would make it the fourth most destructive.

The duo of fires are among several still burning that have been incredibly devastating because of their proximity to densely populated areas.

The state’s most devastating wildfire is the 2018 Camp fire, which destroyed more than 18,000 structures as it burned across 153,000 acres. The second most destructive, the Tubbs fire, destroyed about 5,600 structures in Napa and Sonoma Counties in 2017.

Wildfires have scorched more than 5 million acres of the American West, leaving dozens dead and a smoke cloud that crosses the continent.

They say history doesn’t repeat; it rhymes. In this case, it practically stuttered.

Seeing images of the wreckage out West, I’m reminded of the day we were outside the town of Nowra on Australia’s southeastern coast. The smell of smoke was gone, thanks to a wind that had come through a few days earlier. All that was left were the charred trunks of dead trees as far as you could see. There were no birds singing, no crickets chirping, no wombats rustling through the underbrush. Just eerie silence.

Another vivid memory comes from later that day. We had stopped in the town of Batemans Bay, about 75 miles south, which had been pummeled by the fires. There, all you could see was house after house reduced to nothing but a chimney, a shell of a truck or two, and rubble. Stepping through the ashes and scanning the remains of what had been left behind, I felt as if I could be in Pompeii or Athens, exploring some ancient archaeological site, except that these houses had been someone’s home just a few weeks earlier.

But across much of the American West, wildfires should be a big concern as summer approaches. This is especially true in Northern California, where the winter of 2019-20 was exceptionally dry and has set the stage for a potentially frightening wildfire season.

To make matters worse, many of the preparations needed to manage the risk have been disrupted by the pandemic. Which is why, for the 25 million people in the American West who live in homes and communities that abut or blend into wild landscapes, now is the time to make these places safer.

This year, California had its driest February on record. Many parts of the state had no rain or snow in what is normally one of the wettest months of the year. This followed a wet 2018-19 winter across the West. Historically, a dry year following a wet one is a recipe for wildfire. The wet conditions support abundant growth of grasses, brush and trees, and the dry conditions convert that into the kind of cured, dry fuel that can erupt into the cataclysmic fires that have increasingly plagued the West in the past decade.

The dry conditions add urgency for the U.S. Forest Service, the National Interagency Fire Center, state and local fire agencies, and private landowners to prepare now. Some of the most effective preparations focus on fuel reduction. They include thinning, creating fuel breaks and undertaking prescribed burns to reduce excessive amounts of brush and trees. These controlled burns during the spring and early summer are an especially cost-effective way to reduce the danger.",winter 201920 exceptionally dry northern california followed wet 201819 winter across west historically dry year following wet one recipe wildfire,California,,PCG,11.054990768432617,11.045042037963867,11.273900985717773,11.642070770263672,-0.08999311421551315,2.0720513961583436,1.9801935783632814,5.310542669175754

Gavin Newsom was unclear. In a letter earlier this month, Governor Newsom invited Mr. Trump to visit the state to see the areas that were affected by the fires, to meet with residents and to thank the firefighters who have been working to contain the flames.

“In the spirit of this great country, we must not politicize human tragedy or spread disinformation from the sidelines,” Governor Newsom wrote. “Hundreds of thousands of Americans — displaced from their homes and fearful for the future — deserve to see all of us working in their best interests to ensure a fast recovery and rebuild.”

During his first administration Mr. Trump visited the state in the aftermath of the Camp fire, one of the deadliest wildfires in state history, in Northern California.

A meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Newsom could be an opportunity for a show of bipartisanship in a state that has been ravaged by fires. The two leaders have had an antagonistic relationship at times. In addition to taking issue with how California handles its water, Mr. Trump has been critical over how the state manages its forests.

The landscape is parched and vegetation is withered, making the area dangerously susceptible to burning, an unusual situation for January.

“The sort of dryness we’re seeing in a lot of the plant species right now mirrors what you would typically expect in October or early November, when the rainy season starts,” said Jonathan O’Brien, a meteorologist with the U.S. Forest Service.

Wildfires are a year-round threat in California. But a good soaking of rain in fall or at the start of winter usually puts an end to the peak part of wildfire season, when the most destructive wildfires typically occur. About two inches of rain is required to saturate the ground and vegetation and significantly lower the wildfire risk.

Already, there have been more than 3,000 fires in 2022. On Monday, a blaze erupted in Sierra Nevada Gold Country and exploded to more than 3,500 acres. The fire, which was 5 percent contained as of Tuesday evening, has forced hundreds to evacuate their homes.

While we can’t entirely prevent fires, we can take steps to minimize their damage. Today I’m providing some tips for how to best prepare for wildfire season in California:

Ready your home

There are several measures you can take to help protect your property from wildfires, including clearing gutters, trimming brush and adding fire-resistant plants to your garden.

One of the more effective measures is creating a defensible space, a buffer of at least 100 feet (preferably more) between your home and flammable vegetation. The space helps prevent your home from catching fire — either from embers or flames — and provides firefighters a safe area to work in so they can defend your property.

It may seem hard to understand why the combined resources of the federal government, California and Los Angeles haven’t been able to defeat the wildfires after a week of fighting them.

The winds are a major reason. The gusts hurl embers across great distances, spreading fire quickly and thwarting efforts to pinch it off. Planes and helicopters that spray water and flame retardant can’t fly. Firefighters on the ground can’t battle the flames on streets and hillsides without fear they’ll be incinerated.

As wildfires burn homes across California, the state is also grappling with a different kind of climate predicament: How to stop insurers from abandoning fire-prone areas, leaving countless homeowners at risk.

Years of megafires have caused huge losses for insurance companies, a problem so severe that, last year, California temporarily banned insurers from canceling policies on some 800,000 homes in or near risky parts of the state. However, that ban is about expire and can’t be renewed, and a recent plan to deal with the problem fell apart in a clash between insurers and consumer advocates.

Insurers are widely expected to continue their retreat, potentially devastating the housing market if homes become essentially uninsurable.

“The marketplace has largely collapsed” in those high-risk areas, said Graham Knaus, executive director of the California State Association of Counties, which has pushed state officials to address the problem. “It’s a very large geographic area of the state that is facing this.”",california grappling different kind climate predicament stop insurers abandoning fireprone areas years megafires caused huge losses insurance companies california temporarily banned insurers canceling policies 80,California,,PCG,9.074844360351562,9.224102973937988,9.114645957946777,8.955438613891602,1.6447512228258587,-1.1866413059402474,0.4385926194956022,-1.315788367474934

The deal will leave the roughly 70,000 homeowners and businesses that lost properties to the fires owning 22.19 percent of PG&E’s stock once it settles its bankruptcy, the company said in a securities filing. That is up from the 20 percent agreed to by the company and lawyers representing victims in December.

PG&E had promised to pay victims an estimated $13.5 billion, half in cash and half in stock. But the company’s stock price, which closed Friday at $11.02, has fallen nearly 40 percent since early February. Some victims and their lawyers were worried that they would end up with less than the targeted amount.

In the filing, the company said a trust that will manage the stock for wildfire victims can start selling shares 90 days after it receives them.

Chile’s national disaster response service, Senapred, said alerts went out starting on Friday, and gave people evacuation instructions but did not order them to leave.

Regina Figueroa, 53, a resident of the Villa Independencia settlement outside Viña del Mar, said she received a cellphone alert with evacuation instructions on Friday when the fire was already closing in on her home.

“I got the alert,’’ she said, “and ran out into the street. When I got onto the road, the flames were already at the corner.”

Ms. Figueroa picked up her 5-year-old grandson, she said. The flames were so close, she could feel the heat as she ran. She stopped and dunked the boy, who was crying, in a swimming pool to cool him off, she said, then continued racing up a staircase to escape.

“The sky was black,’’ she said. “You couldn’t see anything. Everyone was screaming, shouting instructions, wailing into the wind.”

She reached the top of the staircase and stopped to catch her breath, sobbing.

“I couldn’t believe we were alive. But we were the lucky ones,” she said. “I lost my mother-in-law, my sister-in law. They died, calcified in the street because they couldn’t escape the flames.”

Several blocks of Villa Independencia were decimated by fire.

In El Olivar, Mr. Castro Vázquez said residents had fled to a local square when the cellphone alert came.

Black smoke plumed over a hill from a botanical gardens on the other side of the hill, he said, and within minutes their community was engulfed in tall orange flames.

Another resident, Andrés Calderón, 40, said several people in the neighborhood hadn’t wanted to leave their homes, fearing that thieves would burglarize them.

When he received the alert, Mr. Calderón said he jumped into his car and drove through smoke so thick he said he had to turn on his headlights.

“It was like entering hell,” Mr. Calderón said. “I couldn’t see, the wind was blowing the car almost off the road. I just kept driving.”

On Sunday, the area, which was a mix of decades-old public housing and improvised dwellings, had been reduced to rubble. The sides of road were covered in corrugated metal sheets and debris pushed into piles, everything blackened and smelling of smoke.

Here in California, where rain is rare in many parts of the state from late spring until deep into fall, “fire season” has become a cruel and extended part of the calendar.

When disaster is perennial, there is a natural repetition to how it is covered — the rising dread caused by forecasts of high winds, the brave rush into the scene when flames appear, the chaotic and frightening evacuation of people, and the aftermath of destruction.

Then he saw the flames in his rearview mirror.

This was November 2018, and the Camp Fire, the most destructive wildfire in California history, was making swift and smoky headway through the Sierra Nevada foothills. It took fewer than four hours to rip through this town of 26,000 residents, reducing schools, businesses, and 11,000 homes into piles of smoldering ash. When Mr. Singer got the evacuation order, he believed it was another false alarm. But he peeled out of his driveway as flames licked his yard, making it out of town with minutes to spare.

Paradise was lost. Eighty-five people died, and more than 90 percent of its population was driven out. Two years later, about 4,000 residents have returned to its scorched earth to lay new foundations and test fate once again. Mr. Singer, who has spent the past 24 months preparing to rebuild his home, is among them.

Now he is having second thoughts.

For decades in this chaparral-covered ecosystem, it’s been a ritual: after the burn comes the rebuild. But as the nation’s most populous state stares down a seething climate crisis, one that cranked temperatures into triple digits last fall and set off a series of infernos that exploded, into bone dry air, the rebuilding process is beginning to look different.

California has battled dual crises, with the largest wildfire season on record breaking out in the midst of the pandemic. At the close of 2020, as millions of Californians were put under a second lockdown in a bid to quell a massive second surge in Covid-19 cases, more than 4.2 million acres of the state had been scorched by nearly 10,000 fires. But in many ways, the crises have split the state into two: Northern California continues to reel from multiple megafires, including the August Complex Fire and the SCU Lightning Complex Fire that exploded in late summer.

The measure, which applies to almost one-fifth of the state’s residential insurance market, prohibits companies from canceling or refusing to renew insurance policies for 2.1 million households in or near areas hit by this year’s wildfires.

The announcement reflects the increasing strain that climate change has placed on California, which had imposed a similar moratorium once before, at a smaller scale. As rising temperatures and longer droughts make wildfires more devastating, some insurers have responded to enormous financial losses by leaving fire-prone communities. That threatens the economies of those areas, because homes that can’t easily be insured are harder to sell, and nearly impossible to rebuild after a fire.

California’s struggles are a preview of the threat that climate change poses to the long-term economic health of communities around the country. Insurers have begun pulling back from fire-prone areas in other states across the West.

Carbon-offset programs, which are designed to fight climate change, typically pay landowners to manage their land in ways that store carbon. Usually, that means paying landowners to not chop down trees.

Wildfires, however, don’t respect those agreements.

An estimated 153,000 acres of forests that are part of California’s carbon-offset project have burned so far this summer, according to CarbonPlan, a nonprofit climate-research organization. Three projects have been affected. In Oregon, a quarter of the Klamath East project, or close to 100,000 acres, has burned in the Bootleg Fire since early July.

The Line fire and others feed on a “whiplash” between very wet conditions and extremely hot conditions.

“It’s arguably the worst climate sequence for the wildfire in Southern California,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. For the past two years, wet conditions have caused vegetative growth that quickly dried out during the coastal heat wave that began last week.

That program, the California FAIR Plan, was created by state lawmakers in 1968 to cover people who couldn’t get standard home insurance for various reasons. But as climate change makes wildfires more frequent and intense, causing commercial insurance companies to pull back from the state, the rapidly growing FAIR Plan has become the linchpin holding together California’s increasingly fragile insurance market.

Because of the fires that started last week, that linchpin may be about to break, with consequences that would reverberate throughout California’s economy.

As of last Friday, the FAIR Plan had just $377 million available to pay claims, according to the office of Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat of California.

Officials Warn of Compromised Drinking Water in Fire-Ravaged Areas,2025-01-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/la-drinking-water-wildfires.html,"California, Los Angeles County, Altadena","As fires across Los Angeles County start to wind down, health officials are warning about risks related to water systems in the area.

Municipal water pipes damaged by fire can lose pressure, causing them to suck in smoke and harmful chemicals. Those chemicals can make their way through the water system and linger for years. Plastic piping, commonly used to carry water in quake-prone states like California, can also release chemicals into drinking water if the piping is heated, melted or burned.

One concern is benzene, which is abundant in wildfire smoke. If inhaled or ingested, benzene can lead to nausea and vomiting in the short term and may cause cancer over time.

After the wildfire that destroyed Paradise in 2018, testing found benzene concentrations in drinking water had spiked to more than 80 times levels that California health officials say are dangerous for short-term exposure.

Naphthalene and methylene chloride, present in plastic, adhesives and other household materials, can also contaminate drinking water and disperse easily into the air.

All but five of the 37 groves have been at least partially burned in recent wildfires. Numerous giant monarchs, the largest sequoias in the grove, have been killed. Experts estimated in 2021 that there were about 75,000 giant sequoias left.

“Without urgent action, wildfires could eliminate countless more iconic giant sequoias,” said Randy Moore, the chief of the Forest Service. “We can and must do more to protect giant sequoias using all the tools and flexibilities available to us.

Imagine if the opposite happened and wildfires typically raised surface temperatures. The extra heat could dry out forests and cause even more wildfires to break out. That would be a disastrous feedback loop.

“It’s reassuring that there’s not going to be a positive feedback” from forest fires to smoke to more forest fires, Michael Fromm, a meteorologist for the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, told me on Thursday.

That said, there’s still a lot that’s unknown about the effects of wildfires, which are becoming more common as the planet heats up. Fromm told me that wildfires haven’t yet been incorporated into the giant computer models that are used to forecast climate change.

So far in 2020, more than two million acres have burned across the state of California. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, declared a state of emergency in five counties. But why have the fires been so horrific? And why do they keep happening?

In this lesson, you will learn from a bioclimatologist, a climate research scientist and a geoscientist about why California continues to have so many wildfires. Then, you will find a visual way to communicate what you have learned in the article or to study how the climate has changed in your community.

What do you know about the wildfires in California?

Do you have any personal or emotional connection to what is happening?

What more do you want to know about the California wildfires?

According to an analysis from Shan Ge, a professor of finance at New York University who studies the insurance industry, Hawaii had the highest home insurance markup rates of any state from 1996 to 2021, as insurers raised premiums for homeowners without having to pay out many claims.

Insurers are primarily concerned with two factors when deciding how much coverage to offer and where: the frequency of claims and the severity of those claims. The Maui fires are another data point of losses for insurers. Operating at a profit becomes harder for underwriters as extreme weather events become more frequent and powerful.

The Maui fires came at a time of crisis for the global insurance market, as the frequency of costly disasters brought on by climate change has scrambled the math for insurers, making it harder for them to get access to fresh capital. Since the start of the year, insurers have paid out more than $40 billion in damage claims, on a pace for a record in yearly losses.

The insurers for insurance companies, also known as reinsurers, are an important part of the equation. Reinsurers have been losing money for years, and they’ve been forced to raise their prices. Those rising prices, in turn, have been cited by companies like State Farm and Allstate as the reason they’re pulling back their coverage in some places.",hawaii highest home insurance markup rates state 196 2021 since start year insurers paid 40 billion,Hawaii,,HE,11.859999656677246,9.65999984741211,13.970000267028809,13.319999694824219,-18.549745977661345,44.61698227429412,17.79089942185302,12.31028735591054

The center houses about 40 ‘akikiki, a native songbird, and about 40 ‘alalā, also known as the Hawaiian crow. ‘Alalā are extinct in the wild, and only about five ‘akikiki are known to remain there.

There were clashes with her administration over the scope of his authority, his compensation and the extent to which the Palisades should reopen to the public.

It was disconcertingly quiet; except for the crews working to restore power and the occasional fire truck, the streets, blocked off on this day by police and National Guard cordons, were deserted.

In some ways, Sept. 11 stands alone as an American catastrophe. Nearly 3,000 people died that day in Lower Manhattan. The terror attacks reshaped America’s place in the world, and transformed our airports and our homeland security system. It is one of the reasons the nation went to war in Iraq.

In a section titled “Overriding Disastrous California Policies,” the order tasked more than half a dozen agencies with finding ways to circumvent federal and state laws that control various aspects of water management in California.

It was almost six months to the day since the deadliest American fires in a century killed more than 100 people when flames tore through Lahaina, in Maui, burning up much of Hawaii’s precolonial capital and forcing residents to jump into the ocean for safety, the flames leaping over them to ignite the boats docked in the harbor.

Two record-setting episodes of fire death in half a year might once have looked like a world-historical ecological coincidence, but it has been a year of fire extremes — and a year in which the world has mostly whistled past them. In the United States, mercifully little land burned — only 2.6 million acres, which was less than half the recent average. But in Canada, fires ate through more than twice as much forest as the country’s previous modern record, the total burn scar large enough that more than half the world’s countries could fit inside. In Greece, one fire forced the country’s largest-ever evacuation, and another became the largest fire in the history of the European Union. And in Australia, the bush fire season has burned over 150 million acres — three times the land burned last year in Canada and more than twice as much land as was destroyed in Australia’s Black Summer of 2019-20, when Sydney Harbor was so choked with smoke that ferries couldn’t navigate the waters, at least a billion animals were consumed by flames and panicked evacuees had to be rescued from a beach by military helicopter.

When the fire historian Stephen Pyne says that we are now living in the “Pyrocene,” this is part of what he means: Forest fires are now burning twice as much tree cover, globally, as they did just 20 years ago, and the world is quickly inuring itself to that fact. In parts of the world as far-flung as Fort McMurray, Alberta; Lahaina, Hawaii; Boulder County, Colo.; and now Valparaiso, Chile — where at least 15,000 homes have been destroyed — the new age of fire has produced what the climate scientist Daniel Swain has called the return of the “urban firestorm.” Of the 10 deadliest fires on Earth since 1900, five have occurred since 2018.

How did it get this way? The intuitive, conventional answer is climate change. But where people choose to live matters, too.

WASHINGTON — With wildfires raging across the West, climate change took center stage in the race for the White House on Monday as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called President Trump a “climate arsonist” while the president said that “I don’t think science knows” what is actually happening.

A day of dueling appearances laid out the stark differences between the two candidates, an incumbent president who has long scorned climate change as a hoax and rolled back environmental regulations and a challenger who has called for an aggressive campaign to curb the greenhouse gases blamed for increasingly extreme weather.

Mr. Trump flew to California after weeks of public silence about the flames that have forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes, wiped out communities and forests, burned millions of acres, shrouded the region in smoke and left at least 27 people dead. But even when confronted by California’s governor and other state officials, the president insisted on attributing the crisis solely to poor forest management, not climate change.

Mr. Biden, for his part, assailed Mr. Trump’s record on the climate, asserting that the president’s inaction and denial had fed destruction, citing not just the current emergency on the West Coast but flooding in the Midwest and hurricanes along the Gulf Coast.

And on X and Truth Social and, indeed, Fox News, they were playing the hits, too — the fires were not the result of climate change or an extraordinary wind event meeting an extraordinary drought but the responsibility of Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles and the city’s fire chief, until this point anonymous nationally, who had the audacity to be a woman.

It was a remarkable reversal, conservatives demagoguing California fire disaster, but after the conspiratorial deluge of Hurricane Helene, it need not have been surprising. Had the Los Angeles Fire Department’s budget really been cut? The fire hydrants were dry primarily because of the demand from the fires themselves, it turned out. There had been no political showdown about a fish called a smelt, and the California supply of water did not hang on its fate. The chaparral was not dry because of water policy choices. The order to suspend controlled burns that took place last year — yes, perhaps shortsighted — was given to ensure that firefighters were available to work the line on uncontrolled blazes elsewhere.

But you don’t get disasters of this scale without human failure, too. For years now, watching record-setting fire after record-setting fire, doomscrolling through phone footage of panicked fire-encircled evacuations and clocking the number of new cities visited by eerie and unbreathable clouds of wildfire smoke, it has been easy to mark each new disaster, many unprecedented in our lifetimes, with the scream, “Climate change!” It is also not enough. Decarbonization hasn’t yet solved the risk of catastrophic fire, and more rapid emissions reductions won’t significantly reduce that risk for decades, either. In the meantime, it cannot be the case — must not be — that there was or is nothing more to do.

Global warming has already remodeled the risk landscape in California and well beyond, making gigafire burns and urban firestorms like this one so much more likely. But so has housing policy, which has directed much more development into the path of fire across the vast tinderbox of the American West. The problem of forest management looms larger in Northern California, with decades of fire suppression producing much denser and more flammable forests there, but the job of brush clearing and fuel thinning has been neglected around Los Angeles, too. In a place like Palisades, where the homes became the fuel, a whole program of home hardening is now harrowingly necessary, to make existing homes much less vulnerable even when the embers descend in blankets from miles away.

What would that hardening look like, enacted at the scale of not just a community but a megalopolis, perhaps a whole state or even a continent? The job is in ways both forbidding and banal. Those forests, now intimidating heaps of fuel, must be thinned — in California perhaps almost four million acres annually, nearly equivalent to the state’s worst fire season in modern history. Brushland and scrubland, while trickier, must be managed better, too: when possible, with controlled and traditional burning and, when not, through mechanical thinning and more aggressive use of strategic fire breaks, particularly along ridge lines, and debris clearance, especially in those canyons, like firepits, sometimes called jackpots. On the urban side of the what’s known as the wildland-urban interface, we probably need a program of systematically reducing risk to property by property — retrofitting homes and roofs, eliminating flammable flora, ensuring homes sit clear of anything flammable. Beyond that, some way of overcoming longstanding NIMBYish resistance, explained less by partisanship or climate denial than a more quotidian mix of lack of urgency, homeowner libertarianism and simple wishful thinking.",conservatives demagogued california fire disaster need surprising fire hydrants dry primarily demand fires decarbonization hasnt yet solved risk catastrophic fire,California,,PCG,17.144750595092773,16.19614601135254,16.19614601135254,16.845191955566406,-5.532915620316735,0.0,-5.532915620316735,-1.7472324130052255

The landscape was parched and the wind was fierce, and over the next few days the modest blaze exploded into a raging conflagration. It raced down into the valley and toward Okanagan Lake. Wind blew red-hot embers across the water, sparking new fires around the city of Kelowna.

“I didn’t sleep much the night that the West Kelowna fires crossed the lake,” said Karen Hodges, who lives in Kelowna. “I could see the fires from my window. And so I was thinking about people I know in the valley and where their houses were.”

Dr. Hodges, a conservation ecologist at the University of British Columbia Okanagan, also found herself worried about wildlife. She had been studying some Western screech owls that had been nesting in the heart of the fast-moving inferno. “That speed of fire would be difficult for animals to evacuate in front of,” she said. Had the owls escaped in time? And after Canada’s worst wildfire season on record, what would be left for the survivors?

Fire is a natural phenomenon; some species actually benefit from its effects and even those that don’t can be remarkably resilient in the face of flames.

The trustee, John K. Trotter, said the payments, which will go to an estimated 15,000 people, had become necessary because some fire victims who have been struggling in recent years have become destitute during the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced large parts of the economy to seize up.

“The general state of affairs for these people is so dire it’s almost hard to describe,” said Mr. Trotter, a retired state court justice who was appointed to oversee the fund by a federal bankruptcy court. “Covid and this season’s wildfires have just added to their misery. If this does not qualify as a humanitarian crisis, I don’t know what will.”",trustee overseeing 135 billion compensation fund ordered emergency payments 250 people lost property suffered injuries wildfires trustee john k trotter said,California,,PCG,10.358457565307617,10.65697193145752,11.04504108428955,12.22914981842041,2.881841859831351,3.641457961304364,6.628240880972745,18.059563803959442

Another neighbor reported that his lights flickered a few minutes before he saw fire underneath the tower.

So far, many clues to the origins of the deadly Eaton fire, which started in the area just after 6 p.m. that evening and went on to kill 17 people, have pointed to the brushy hillside where a tangle of electrical lines stretch up Eaton Canyon.

Yet Southern California Edison, the utility that operates the electricity infrastructure in much of the Los Angeles region, has said it has no record of an electrical failure on its lines in the vicinity, and that three low-voltage distribution lines in the area had been de-energized long before the fire.

While an official cause is likely to take months for investigators to determine, a growing body of evidence is emerging that suggests the fire started in the dry grasses below a set of transmission towers carrying high-energy power lines. The lines were buffeted that evening by winds that at times reached 100 miles per hour.",growing body evidence suggests fire started dry grasses set transmission towers lines buffeted evening winds times reached 100 miles per hour,Los Angeles,,TRV,240.87454223632812,249.98724365234375,249.98724365234375,243.60337829589844,3.783173319775289,0.0,3.783173319775289,1.1328868689215743

The deal would allow the company to resolve its bankruptcy and provide homeowners money to rebuild.

But as a crucial deadline for a formal vote on the agreement nears, some victims are pressing the company to make changes.

A group of victims and their lawyers say they are worried that they will receive a lot less than $13.5 billion since half of that amount will be paid out in shares in PG&E. The company’s stock price has been whiplashed as the economy has been upended by the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, some victims said a leading lawyer who negotiated the deal on behalf of thousands of victims appeared to have a conflict of interest: He has borrowed money from a loan facility funded by two investment firms that purchased claims against PG&E, own stock in the utility, invested in PG&E bonds or helped finance its bankruptcy.

Two-thirds of the votes cast by the roughly 70,000 victims, most of whom live in Northern California, by May 15 must be for the deal for it to be approved. If the victims don’t ratify the deal, PG&E might not be able to resolve its bankruptcy by June 30, a deadline state lawmakers set for the company to qualify for a $20 billion wildfire fund that will help pay for future wildfire claims against privately owned utilities.",pacific gas electric thousands california families lost homes loved ones fires reached 135 billion settlement december crucial deadline formal vote agreement nears victims pressing,California,,PCG,10.457962989807129,10.587320327758789,10.089795112609863,11.532614707946777,1.2369267139091857,-4.69925533323545,-3.5204549638978553,10.275918160994255

In recent years, both states have been more prone to extreme weather events than Hawaii.

But the deadly fires in Maui this week, which destroyed thousands of homes and will take what the state’s governor said would be billions of dollars to rebuild from, may make insurance companies reconsider policy rates and coverage, as they have in more disaster-prone areas.

The two threats this week aren’t connected directly. But a common factor is adding to their capacity to cause misery.

Human-caused climate change is turning high temperatures that would once have been considered improbable into more commonplace occurrences. And it is intensifying the heat and dryness that fuel catastrophic wildfires, allowing them to burn longer and more ferociously, and to churn out more smoke.

Climate change is “the elephant in the room” that is worsening wildfires and their effects on air quality, said John C. Lin, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Utah.

The state lacks building standards that would better protect structures against wildfires, for example, by requiring the use of fire-resistant materials and construction techniques, or by maintaining space around structures that are clear of flammable vegetation.

That puts Hawaii out of step with much of the country: 21 states, including California and most other Western states, have adopted those standards, according to the International Code Council, the Washington-based nonprofit group that compiles them.

Last month, Gov. Josh Green of Hawaii issued an order that stops the state from adopting new or updated building standards. The governor said the move was necessary to address a severe housing shortage.

Attempts to block tougher building codes in the name of affordability are common nationwide, even if it sacrifices safety, said Michele Steinberg, wildfire division director for the National Fire Protection Association.",state lacks building standards would better protect structures wildfires 21 states including california western states adopted standards,Washington,,WY,30.871408462524414,30.642728805541992,30.776123046875,31.09055519104004,-0.7407490243278725,0.4353210256812453,-0.30865263489705513,0.7098695505961536

“Environmentalist wackos” — Mr. Limbaugh’s phrase — “want man to be responsible for it because they want to control your behavior,” the conservative host said on the show, adding they “want to convince you that your lifestyle choices are the reason why all these fires are firing up out on the Left Coast.”

wildfire,The L.A. Fires Taught Me How to Accept Help,2025-01-31,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/opinion/la-wildfires-altadena-fires.html,Los Angeles,"My mother made it clear that imposing on anyone for just about any reason — even asking for a ride home from school from a friend’s parent who was going that direction anyway — was an almost unthinkable transgression. Trick-or-treating on Halloween was likened to begging. When my father, alone in our suburban house, had the first of three heart attacks at age 49, he walked to the hospital rather than call for help. Decades later, when my mother lay dying in her small apartment, she became insistent that we financially compensate the kind neighbor who’d offered me a spare bedroom.

“But people want to help,” I explained. “Refusing kindness is a form of unkindness.”

I didn’t entirely believe my words even as I said them. I was my parents’ child. But I could ask for help on someone else’s behalf.

That appears to be a natural human impulse, as demonstrated by how many of the approximately 3,000 GoFundMe pages for Los Angeles fire victims are set up by third parties on behalf of their loved ones. When I heard that friends were conspiring to make a page for me, I put an immediate stop to it. Given that I was able-bodied, relatively financially stable, a renter rather than a homeowner and had no human dependents, I found the idea unseemly.

As texts and emails piled up from people asking how they could help, I told them the best thing was to become paying subscribers to my podcast through my Substack page. “Now’s the time to pony up for all those bonus episodes,” I said. “Plus discounts on merch!”

But that wasn’t enough for them. They didn’t want to pay for my services. They wanted to be of service. After the 11th or 12th person explained as much, I finally got it (and reluctantly agreed to a discreet “tip jar” on the Substack page). This wasn’t about me asking for help. It was about them asking to be allowed to help. They might have been the ones opening their doors and often their wallets. But the heaviest door of all was the one my pride kept shut tight, turning them away as if they were asking only as a formality. And that kind of rejection, I suspect, is a lot ruder than asking for a ride home from school.",father alone suburban house first three heart attacks age 49 walked hospital rather call help decades later mother lay dying small apartment,Los Angeles,,TRV,248.0750732421875,244.18099975585938,243.60337829589844,243.06556701660156,-1.569715745896997,-0.23655462977810043,-1.8025571404038223,-2.019350900561993

To answer these questions, he interviewed more than four dozen experts: economists and demographers, climate scientists and insurance executives, architects and urban planners, and mapped out the danger zones that will close in on Americans over the next 30 years.

What he found was a nation on the cusp of a great transformation. Across the United States, some 162 million people — nearly one in two — will most likely experience a decline in the quality of their environment, namely more heat and less water. For 93 million of them, the changes could be particularly severe, and by 2070, analysis suggests, if carbon emissions rise at extreme levels, at least four million Americans could find themselves living at the fringe, in places decidedly outside the ideal niche for human life.

Then what? One influential 2018 study, published in The Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, suggests that one in 12 Americans in the Southern half of the country will move toward California, the Mountain West or the Northwest over the next 45 years because of climate influences alone. Such a shift in population is likely to increase poverty and widen the gulf between the rich and the poor.

“In the absence of federal leadership, California will continue to lead,” he said. “The more we push into this space, more partners will be forthcoming.”

She’s Telling Its Stories.,2021-10-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/09/books/paradise-wildfire-lizzie-johnson-interview.html,"Calif., California","Images of the wildfire that devastated Paradise, Calif., in 2018 are hard to forget. Known as the Camp Fire — after Camp Creek Road, where it started — the disaster killed at least 85 people and essentially destroyed the entire town. Lizzie Johnson was a reporter at The San Francisco Chronicle at the time, and her new book, “Paradise,” is a vivid ticktock account of the disaster, told through the stories of those who experienced it. Johnson, now a reporter at The Washington Post, talks about the fire as a turning point, how the scope and structure of her book changed over time and more.

When did you first get the idea to write this book?

The book came about a lot earlier than the Camp Fire itself. I’d been writing about wildfires for a while, and there wasn’t much being written about the longer-term effect of them — how people tried to rebuild their lives and their sense of community, and about what these fires were doing to the landscape and our collective sense of safety in California. It seemed like every year the state got a little itchier. When the Camp Fire happened, it became clear that it was a big turning point for the state, and I knew that’s what the book would be about, and that I would weave in the other fires I’ve covered.

There’s no way I could get all of this into a newspaper. Everything was so chaotic, and it was really hard to understand what had happened, and there was that grasping for months and even years after, wondering how this fire started and what it did to this town.

What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?

I’m really obsessive about my reporting, and for whatever reason I was trying to learn more about the Oroville Dam. One of the big natural near-disasters that happened in California was in 2017, when they got way too much rain and the dam, which is the tallest in the country, almost split. When they built it, they’d imported all these stones from all around the world, and there are stones from the Taj Mahal in the dam, which is wild.

But Toxic Dangers Still Lurk.,2025-01-15,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/climate/wildfire-smoke-indoors.html,Los Angeles,"“There are so many people who have lost their homes in this, and that is devastating,” said Colleen Reid, who studies the health effects of air pollution at the University of Colorado Boulder, and who led the research. “But even the people who feel lucky that their home is fine — they could actually be exposed to lot of toxic materials,” she said. “The wind will get through every crack.”

That was a particular problem, Professor Reid said, because some people may be more likely to move back more quickly or to tackle cleanup themselves if their insurance companies don’t acknowledge this kind of ash and soot damage. And sifting through ash could send hazardous particles back into the air. There was a move in some states to try to force more insurance companies to compensate for smoke and ash intrusion, she said.

Smoke and overall air quality continued to be a risk, said Yifang Zhu, a professor in environmental health at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The proposals, many of which would require approval by the State Legislature, could remake the real estate market in parts of California and are the latest sign of how climate change is beginning to wreak havoc with parts of the American economy.

On Friday, the insurance commissioner, Ricardo Lara, endorsed proposals that include halting state funding for infrastructure in certain areas prone to fire, leaving vacant lots undeveloped and the expansion of more stringent building codes.

wildfire,Antarctica Was Once a Land of Fire and Not Ice,2021-11-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/07/science/antarctica-wildfires.html,Brazil,"Imagine the forests of Chilean Patagonia: wet and cold, dense with monkey puzzle trees and other hardy conifers. Now imagine it with dinosaurs walking around. And on fire.

This is what Antarctica was like 75 million years ago during the Cretaceous period, an era known by researchers as a “super fire world.” A paper published last month in Polar Research by Flaviana Jorge de Lima of the Federal University of Pernambuco and other scientists in Brazil proves that these conflagrations did not spare any continent, even one that is today notorious for its dry, inhospitable climate and largely vegetation-free landscape.

Although research on prehistoric wildfires — properly called “paleofires” — has been going on for decades, much of it has concentrated on the Northern Hemisphere. Antarctica was “first considered a region without high fires, but that changed,” said André Jasper of the University of Taquari Valley in Brazil. He’s an author on the paper and part of a group of researchers around the globe seeking evidence of fires that burned between 60 million and 300 million years ago.

“It’s really interesting for us because now we’re showing that not only the Northern Hemisphere was burning, but the Southern Hemisphere too,” he said. “It was global.”",researchers found evidence fires burned 60 million 300 million years ago antarctica first considered region without high fires changed andre jasper says,Brazil,,PBR,3.7251718044281006,3.771162271499634,3.771162271499634,3.9589531421661377,1.234586469726429,0.0,1.234586469726429,6.275719618089612

But how much? Pyne, the fire historian, says he used to anchor his understanding of modern Canadian fire with the 2003 season in British Columbia, “which at the time seemed apocalyptic.” But more area has burned in the province in four of the last seven years — as it did in 2010 and 2014 and 2015 as well. “We’re riding the tiger at this point,” he says. This year, the total in British Columbia is 11 times as large as it was in 2003, and 200 times as large as it was in 2020.

In the United States, in recent years, fire scientists and forest ecologists have emphasized the complex human drivers of records like these — that beyond the effects of warming, the American West is dealing with a century of aggressive fire suppression and poor forest management, which together have produced a flame-prone landscape stretching across nearly half the continent and simply waiting to burn. The just-so story substitutes one morality tale for another: fire as comeuppance not only for profligate and irresponsible use of fossil fuels but also for reckless and counterproductive use of the continent’s “natural” landscape. But it is hopeful, too: If policy is to blame for the terrifying risk of out-of-control fire, in theory policy should be able to make it at least somewhat less terrifying too.

This is what the Canadian fire scientist Mike Flannigan calls “the American narrative,” and though some colleagues north of the border have “drank the Kool-Aid,” too, he says, it does not so neatly apply across Canada’s diverse forest ecosystems — especially not the boreal, which has been subject to much less human intervention and which he describes as a cleaner case study on global warming and fire weather. Instead, he emphasizes what might be called the power law of wildfire spread. In Canada, 3 percent of fires cause 97 percent of the damage. Most fires are not hard to put out if you want to extinguish them and don’t spread very fast if you don’t. But on extreme “spread days,” the window for direct attack can be as short as 15 minutes, Flannigan says, and “if you miss that window, your cake is baked, the horse has left the barn, you’re out of luck.” And if a year with three or four truly dangerous days is followed by one with 10 or 15, the effect on total area burned can be not additive but multiplicative, with relatively small changes to patterns of extreme weather yielding world-changing volumes of fire. Across Canada, the fire season has grown by several weeks in recent decades.

Globally, the fire story is less exponential, with declines in burned area in sub-Saharan Africa mostly offsetting rapid fire growth in the major midlatitude hot spots, with the global trend in fire emissions, as a result, mostly flat. But in those major hot spots — western Canada and the western United States, Russian Siberia and Australia, which is now gearing up for what may be a catastrophic bush-fire season — the decades-long trends are clear: up everywhere.

Nearly everyone staring down the wicked problem of living with 21st-century fire offers a similar list of interventions. For the forest ecologist Rachel Holt, it starts with better forest policy, focused on a transformation of the timber industry and the restoration of more resilient landscapes, a more honest accounting of carbon emissions from logging and a more nuanced approach to fire management, including the cultivation of more good fire through controlled burning. “When there’s a raging wildfire, it seems futile, but you have to start local,” Holt says. If we manage the forest around my little town, well, maybe we can stop my little town from burning down,” she says. “Like all things climate-related, we have a massive problem, and there isn’t a quick way. There isn’t an easy solution. We have to get climate change in hand — now, in fact, yesterday. And if we don’t, it’s all a game.” She goes on: “It doesn’t matter what we do in the forest, things are going to burn. We’re going to pass every tipping point there’s ever been. And we’re hooped.”",canada fire season grown several weeks recent decades us fire scientists emphasized complex human drivers records like,Australia,,QBE.AX,14.268613815307617,14.259317398071289,14.305795669555664,14.640433311462402,-0.06515291083395057,0.32595018531996234,0.26058490845240717,2.6058557682449206

For six months, Disney has kept tens of thousands of theme park workers on furlough with full health-care benefits in hopes that a light at the end of the pandemic tunnel would appear. On Tuesday, Disney conceded that none was coming.

The company said it would eliminate 28,000 theme park jobs in the United States, or about 25 percent of its domestic resort work force.

“As heartbreaking as it is to take this action, this is the only feasible option we have in light of the prolonged impact of Covid-19 on our business, including limited capacity due to physical distancing requirements and the continued uncertainty regarding the duration of the pandemic,” Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, said in an email to “cast members,” which is how Disney refers to theme park workers.

About 67 percent of the layoffs will involve part-time jobs that pay by the hour. However, executives and salaried workers will be among the laid off. Disney’s theme parks in California and Florida employed roughly 110,000 before the pandemic. The job cuts, which will come from both resorts, will reduce that number to about 82,000.

Disneyland in California has remained closed because Governor Gavin Newsom has refused to allow theme parks in the state to restart operations. About 31,000 people work at the Disneyland complex and the majority are unionized and have been furloughed.

Mr. D’Amaro said in a statement that the layoffs were “exacerbated in California by the state’s unwillingness to lift restrictions that would allow Disneyland to reopen.”

Walt Disney World in Florida reopened on a limited basis in mid-July. But attendance has been weaker than Disney expected, with concern about coronavirus safety a major factor.

Disney will now begin negotiations with unions that represent the bulk of the affected employees. About 20,000 unionized Disney workers have been called back to work at Disney World. Roughly 20,000 more remain on furlough, a stoppage that began in mid-April.

Good morning.

We knew this was coming.

A dry winter was likely to lead to an explosive fire season that starts early and lasts longer. Lots of rain the winter before that one means there’s lots to burn.

The pandemic, we’ve seen over and over again, has made people who were already vulnerable even more so. Firefighting ranks — usually filled out with prisoners — have been stretched thin, and evacuation protocols complicated by the possible transmission of the coronavirus.

At least three top aides to Vice President Mike Pence have tested positive for the coronavirus in the last few days, people briefed on the matter said. The test results raise fresh questions about the safety protocols at the White House, where masks are not routinely worn.

The vice president’s chief of staff, Marc Short, has tested positive, according to Devin O’Malley, a spokesman for Mr. Pence, who leads the White House coronavirus task force. A person briefed on Mr. Short’s diagnosis said it was received on Saturday.

“Vice President Pence and Mrs. Pence both tested negative for Covid-19 today, and remain in good health,” Mr. O’Malley said. “While Vice President Pence is considered a close contact with Mr. Short, in consultation with the White House Medical Unit, the vice president will maintain his schedule in accordance with the C.D.C. guidelines for essential personnel.”

The statement did not come from the White House medical unit, but instead from a press aide. Two people briefed on the matter said that the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, had sought to keep news of the outbreak from becoming public.

On Sunday, in an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Mr. Meadows denied that he had tried to suppress news of the outbreak, saying he had acted out of concern about “sharing personal information.”

A Trump adviser briefed on the outbreak, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that the Pence adviser Marty Obst also tested positive this week. Mr. Obst’s positive test was first reported by Bloomberg News.

Another person briefed on the developments, who also was not allowed to speak publicly, said that three additional Pence staff members had tested positive. Mr. O’Malley did not immediately respond to a question about others who have tested positive.

Mr. Pence’s decision to continue campaigning, despite his proximity to his chief of staff, is certain to raise fresh questions about how seriously the White House is taking the risks to its staff members and to the public as the pandemic has killed nearly 225,000 people in the United States. The vice president’s office said that both Mr. and Mrs. Pence tested negative again on Sunday.

President Trump, the first lady and several aides and advisers tested positive for the virus roughly three weeks ago. Mr. Trump spent three nights at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and he was treated with an experimental antibody cocktail as well as the powerful steroid dexamethasone.

The administration decided not to trace the contacts of guests and staff members at the Rose Garden celebration on Sept. 26 for the Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, which also included a reception inside the White House. That event was linked to an outbreak that grew to more than 20 cases, as evidence mounted that the administration had done little to prevent or contain the virus’s spread.

Mr. Trump, at rallies over the past two days, has insisted the country is “rounding the turn” on the virus, even though the single-day record for new cases was shattered on Friday.

But the changes could backfire, experts say — pushing insurers to stop offering insurance in those areas and further imperiling communities on the front lines of climate change.

The changes are the latest round in the struggle between California regulators and the insurance industry, which has experienced huge losses starting with the wildfires of 2017 and 2018. In response, insurers have begun refusing to write new coverage for homes in fire-prone areas and dropping existing customers, leaving private insurance hard to get in some places.

That battle has made California into a test case for the financial dangers of climate change, and the political fights that can result. Losing access to private insurance can be devastating, hurting home values and making the homes harder to sell. The state has a high-risk pool for people who can’t get regular insurance, but costs are higher and coverage is limited.

California has struggled to respond to the erosion of its insurance market. Last December, the state’s insurance commissioner, Ricardo Lara, for the first time banned insurers from dropping people in or near areas hit by fires in recent years. But that ban lasts only one year — it expires this coming December — and can’t be renewed.

It should have been an idyllic Labor Day weekend, the serenity of the High Sierra region of California providing a welcome respite from protests and a pandemic.

But about 200 people — many of them unaware that a rapidly growing wildfire was closing in on a popular campground area in the Sierra National Forest — found themselves suddenly trapped while trying to flee Saturday night into Sunday morning.

The very forest where they had come for a holiday escape now provided kindling that helped create a firestorm, one that prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom of California to declare a state of emergency.",200 people trapped wildfire sierra national forest gov gavin newsom california declared state emergency,California,,PCG,9.144497871398926,9.174348831176758,9.064892768859863,9.592269897460938,0.32643629204831814,-1.1930662800278002,-0.8705245893056839,4.896627812255279
wildfire,L.A. Was Prepared for Serious Fires. But It Wasn’t Ready for Four.,2025-01-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/us/los-angeles-calfire-firefighters.html,"California, Los Angeles County, Los Angeles","Los Angeles city fire officials had a similar view. “The fire chief did everything she could with the resources she had,” Patrick Leonard, a battalion chief with the Los Angeles Fire Department, said, referring to the city’s fire chief, Kristin Crowley.

The question of resources will almost certainly arise in the weeks ahead as the fire response is analyzed. The Los Angeles Fire Department has said for years it is dangerously underfunded. A memo sent to city leaders in December by Chief Crowley complained that recent budget cuts had “severely limited the department’s capacity to prepare for, train for, and respond to large-scale emergencies, including wildfires.”

But there are a host of other factors at play. Fire experts have long warned that climate change and more home-building outside of urban areas are straining firefighters’ ability to prevent and contain fires. As fires have grown in size and complexity, California has explored mitigation through thinning brush out of forests, safer power grids and shoring up home protection. But it has been far from enough, they say.

The fires in Los Angeles have also raised the critical question of how departments can battle so many powerful infernos at once. After the Woolsey fire burned more than 1,600 structures in the northern part of the county in 2018 — at the same time that other major fires were raging across the state — Los Angeles County commissioned an assessment that found that the simultaneous outbreaks had slowed the ability of other fire agencies to fight the blaze because they were already busy.

Lori Moore-Merrell, the head of the U.S. Fire Administration, a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who flew this week to Los Angeles to inspect the firefighting efforts and damage, said she believed that the reason for the widespread devastation was not the firefighting response.",question resources almost certainly arise weeks ahead fire response analyzed los angeles fire department said years dangerously underfunded,California,,PCG,17.144750595092773,16.19614601135254,16.19614601135254,16.845191955566406,-5.532915620316735,0.0,-5.532915620316735,-1.7472324130052255
wildfire,"The American West’s Haunting, Smoke-Filled Future",2022-08-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/opinion/environment/wildfire-smoke-health-pollution.html,"Canada, Western United States, Australia","Over the past decade, smoke exposure has doubled or tripled across the American West, “just a remarkable increase,” Burke says. If you narrow the standard to extreme exposure days, with particulate concentrations at 100 micrograms per cubic meter or above, the increase is even more striking: According to his forthcoming research, there are now 27 times as many such days as there were just a decade ago. The wildfire pollution is enough to threaten the gains of the Clean Air Act, according to him — which, though it was passed five decades ago, is still saving an estimated 370,000 American lives each year. Already, he says, about 30 percent of the air quality gains of the landmark law have been undone by wildfire smoke. In 2020 such smoke accounted for roughly half of the air pollution in the Western United States, which means that, on that side of the Rockies, as much toxic smog was coming from wildfires as from all human activity combined.

That smoke is the focus of a growing subfield of research into the damage of air pollution, especially a level of particulate matter called PM2.5, which is the main component of wildfire smoke. Unlike other forms of air pollution, smoke can kill you immediately if you inhale it. While rare among average residents, death from smoke inhalation is common among wildland firefighters, who also suffer significantly higher rates of death from lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. For residents, even short-term exposure to wildfire smoke can worsen bronchitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other respiratory diseases, as well as trigger heart attacks, heart failure and strokes. In an enormous longitudinal study published this May in The Lancet, those living within 30 miles or so of even a single wildfire were, over 20 years, nearly 5 percent more likely to develop lung cancer and 10 percent more likely to develop brain tumors.

As research into the health effects of wildfire smoke expands and deepens, it would not be surprising to see it linked to nearly all the negative outcomes to which PM2.5 pollution has already been linked: cuts to cognitive performance and economic productivity; increases in rates of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and dementia; worse memory, attention and vocabulary; episodes of mental illness, depression, suicide and self-harm; miscarriage, premature birth and low birth weight; pediatric leukemia, kidney cancer, eye tumors and even degenerating eyesight.

These effects aren’t enormous, and the level of absolute risk to any individual means it is somewhat innumerate to think of wildfire smoke as a manifestation of death itself at the door. But the distributed nature of the damage also illustrates what I’ve started to think of as the rule of little numbers in a big world. Perhaps a novel disease kills fewer than 1 percent of those infected, but when billions get sick, the death toll becomes world historical. Perhaps you are breathing air layered with wildfire smoke only several weeks each year, and perhaps the risks to your health are only on the margins — 10 percent here, 5 percent there. But when the same is true for 78 million Americans living across the West (not to mention tens of millions more in Canada, Australia, Siberia and, increasingly, the Mediterranean), the damage mounts. In the years to come, more land will burn in more places, sending off more smoke. Almost all of us, almost everywhere, will be breathing more of it and dealing with the consequences.

Your home may feel like a fortress, and staying indoors forms the basis of public health guidance about managing them. But just how safe you are inside is not so easy to predict. In a recent paper on the social response to smoke, Burke found a 20-fold variation in levels of infiltration among the homes they studied — mostly expensive places in the Bay Area outfitted with air monitors — but also discovered that almost none of that variation could be reduced to income, home price or neighborhood demographics. Living in a nice new build wasn’t enough, in other words. Closing doors and windows helps, of course, but even in houses designed to be almost leakless for reasons of energy efficiency, smoke can come in through dryer vents, oven hoods and HVAC systems.",past decade smoke exposure doubled tripled across american west says michael burke 2020 smoke accounted roughly half air pollution western united states says,Canada,,IFC.TO,182.09815979003906,182.1925811767578,182.7119903564453,178.5474395751953,0.051851917025201553,0.2850879966312046,0.33708773724786817,-1.9498935183846804

Wildfires were also still blazing in nearby Turkey, where at least eight people have died, as well as in other parts of Europe, which is enduring a protracted heat wave and drought that have created tinderbox conditions.

On Sunday morning, the Greek authorities ordered the evacuation of four more villages in northern Evia, an island northeast of Athens, but many residents stayed behind in a desperate effort to protect their homes. State television aired video footage of residents and firefighters using water hoses and tree branches to try to put out the advancing flames.

Hundreds more people were evacuated from Evia by ferry on Sunday, with televised images showing large clouds of gray smoke hanging over the island and blotting out the sun.

A stream of firefighting helicopters taking off from a nearby airport in recent days has flown over Magalia, a community that was also devastated by the Camp Fire. Residents there are out of the path of this year’s flames, Mr. Carhart said, but they are still afraid.

“They see a helicopter with a bucket attached,” he said. “And it’s, ‘Oh my God, here we go again.’”

The two blazes also bear another chilling similarity: Pacific Gas & Electric, the state’s largest utility, said last week that blown fuses on one of its utility poles may have sparked the Dixie Fire. PG&E pleaded guilty last year to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter for its role in starting the Camp Fire.

So far, that level of destruction has been avoided this year.

Mr. Carhart said that crews have been making progress in controlling the Dixie Fire, and the weather has been more cooperative in recent days than fire officials had predicted. Nevertheless, the size and timing of the blaze — which he said is already the 15th-largest in California’s recorded history — point to a future in which fires won’t be limited to a single season.

“One of the most concerning things about it is how early in the year it is,” Mr. Carhart said.

The tree, known as the Grizzly Giant, was more than 2,000 years old, stood more than 200 feet tall and spread branches that were several feet in diameter. Soon after, Roosevelt, who described the tree and its surrounding grove as a “temple,” extended federal protections for the park in the Sierra Nevada of California.

In the past several days, however, the Grizzly Giant has been threatened by the Washburn fire, which has torn through more than 3,700 acres of brush and timber in the southern part of the national park, and prompted evacuation orders for the tourist-driven community of Wawona, Calif.

By midafternoon, they were looking out on an otherworldly skyline.

“It was apocalyptic orange,” said Charles Harris, an architect at the firm.

But inside the office, cool air rippled from the vents running along the ceiling, and large screens reassured employees: “Indoor Air Quality is Very Good.”

The assessment was based on the readings of indoor air-quality sensors that were tracking the real-time levels of pollutants, including the fine particulate matter that makes wildfire smoke so hazardous.

President Trump expressed his support on Tuesday night for a global effort to plant one trillion trees, which itself was announced at a gathering of business and political leaders in Davos, Switzerland, in January. A trillion trees, it was said at that meeting of the World Economic Forum, would go a long way in addressing climate change.

But while trees — and particularly forests full of trees — are vital for swallowing up and storing carbon, currently absorbing 30 percent of planet-warming carbon dioxide, they are also extremely vulnerable in the age of climate disruptions.

In a hotter, drier, more flammable climate, like here in the Mediterranean region, forests can die slowly from drought or they can go up in flames almost instantly, releasing all the carbon stored in their trunks and branches into the atmosphere.

That raises an increasingly urgent question: How best to manage woodlands in a world that humans have so profoundly altered? “We need to decide what will be the climate-change forest for the future,” is how Kirsten Thonicke, a fire ecologist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, framed the challenge.",president trump expressed support tuesday night global effort plant one trillion trees trillion trees said meeting world economic forum would go long way,Spain,,ITX.MC,27.681486129760742,27.832021713256836,28.30135154724121,27.67263412475586,0.5438132287783888,1.6862944374638287,2.2392779584693,-0.03197806997567917

These percentages have shifted significantly in recent decades, according to a 2019 study. The researchers found that since 2000, on average only about 49 percent of tornadoes have happened on less busy days and about 29 percent have happened on days with 20 or more tornadoes.

“Now when tornadoes happen, they often happen in an outbreak environment,” said Tyler Fricker, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Louisiana Monroe and one of the authors of the study.

While the timing of this trend lines up with the planet’s rising temperatures, scientists are hesitant to definitively attribute tornadoes’ clustering behavior to human-caused climate change.

“The link between climate change and tornadoes is still pretty tenuous,” Dr. Fricker said. “It’s a really open and difficult question for us.” One difficulty is that tornadoes are too small on a planetary scale, and too ephemeral, to show up in the global mathematical models that scientists use to study climate change.",1950s 1970s average 69 percent tornadoes united states happened days fewer 10 tornadoes percentages shifted significantly recent decades according 2019 study since,the United States,,TRV,213.19178771972656,213.55532836914062,215.59910583496094,215.40260314941406,0.1705228204624808,0.9570248054347514,1.129179571587985,1.0370077822106156

Readiness for a rare event

On Sept. 1, as the remnants of Hurricane Ida unleashed deadly downpours across the boroughs and threatened a tornado, officials warned residents in the Bronx and Manhattan to “take shelter NOW.”

But it is not clear how many New Yorkers have appropriate shelter, nor how many know what to do if a tornado strikes. A series of national surveys, done yearly from 2017 to 2021, asked 516 New York City residents how much time they believed they would have to reach safety after a tornado warning was issued. About 75 percent of them said they would have more than one hour. In reality, it’s about 15 minutes.

“You can imagine how dangerous that would be if people are thinking: ‘Well, the tornado warning came. I better hop in a cab and get home,’” said Dr. Joseph Ripberger, associate director of the National Institute for Risk and Resilience and an author of a study on the surveys. (Experts say cars are particularly dangerous during tornadoes.)

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in the Western District of Texas, is funded by the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which has clashed with the federal government over its increasingly stringent regulation of digital assets. The suit argues that the Treasury Department overstepped its legal authority by banning Tornado Cash.

The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The department announced last month that it was placing Tornado Cash on a blacklist to prevent hacking, money-laundering and other crypto crimes. Industry groups reacted with fury, arguing that the crackdown would cut off access to a critical tool for preserving privacy.

A so-called cryptocurrency mixer, Tornado Cash is designed to make it harder for law enforcement officials and other observers to track crypto transactions. Every time two people exchange digital currency, the transaction is recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain, which anyone can analyze to trace the movement of funds.

She called her role a “point of pride.”

When Jane Gilbert was appointed in 2021 to be the first chief heat office of Miami-Dade County, Fla., she faced more than a few skeptics. “‘Miami’s always been hot,’” she said they would tell her. “‘We know how to handle it.’”

Some people assumed she worked for the Miami Heat basketball team.

Now, she said, as more and more days have broken heat index records, South Florida residents have come to appreciate her role. “It’s a point of pride instead,” she said.

We spoke to her about this summer’s extreme heat. The conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.

How do you explain your job to people?

If you live in air-conditioning, work in air-conditioning and get around in an air-conditioned car, heat’s not really an issue. But if you live in substandard housing, if you work either outside or in an undercooled indoor environment, it’s quite dangerous.

We have certain ZIP codes within Miami-Dade County that, according to our heat vulnerability assessment, are having more than four times the number of heat-related emergency department visits than in other ZIP codes — for heat syncope, heat exhaustion, heatstroke. The strongest correlation is that they’re lower-income areas with higher land-surface temperatures and a higher percentage of outdoor workers. So, it is disproportionately impacting lower socioeconomic populations.

Miami temperatures don’t get as high as in other parts of the country. We’ve got the ocean breeze, for example. Does that lure people into thinking it is not as hot here?

We don’t get temperatures over 100 degrees, though we’re getting many more days over 90 degrees than we have had historically. And it’s very routine for us to have 70, 80 percent humidity. According to the National Weather Service, over the last 14 years, we reached a heat index of 105 an average of six times a year.

Well, we’ve already had three advisories this June.

What we have is chronic high heat. So we’ve established from May 1 to Oct. 31 as an official heat season, and we do public outreach throughout that time, reminding people to drink water, take breaks, find a shaded spot, think about the hours you’re out during the day. We’ve partnered with community health practitioners, the most trusted messengers in the community, to ask when someone is having more accentuated symptoms of their mental illness. Or, to remember that their prescriptions may make them more sensitive to heat. Or, that their kidney condition could be made worse if they don’t have adequate cooling.

Do you commiserate with other heat officers?

There are two in the country that I’m aware of: one in Phoenix and one in L.A. And then, around the globe: in Monterrey, Mexico; Santiago, Chile; Freetown, Sierra Leone; Athens, Greece; North Dhaka, Bangladesh; Melbourne, Australia. We have a WhatsApp group. And we do periodic calls to check in. We met last year in Washington and are looking to get together in the fall.

But Mr. Miller, the former mayor of the town, was also thinking about the bears. Scattered across town were 12-foot-tall wooden bears, carved with chain saws, to commemorate one of Sharkey County’s most famous legends: the day former President Theodore Roosevelt, nicknamed Teddy, refused to kill a captured bear on a hunting trip here, declaring it unsportsmanlike. That decision, memorialized in a political cartoon, led a New York toymaker to create a stuffed bear and name it “Teddy’s Bear,” which later became known as the teddy bear.

The legend is told throughout town, Mr. Miller, 73, said in an interview, describing the statue of a bear reading outside the library and one dressed like a policeman outside the police station. In a tradition that began in 2002, the 100th anniversary of the hunt, the town celebrates the Great Delta Bear Affair in October, in part to raise awareness about the Louisiana black bear, which was until recently considered endangered because of habitat loss and hunting.

Toppled power lines and trees. The severe storms that swept through Houston and the Gulf Coast on Thursday left all the destructive traces of a hurricane, yet they didn’t blow in from the tropics.

Violent clusters of thunderstorms cause extensive damage across the United States each year, not just through rain and flooding, but also through hail, tornadoes and walls of blasting wind. Here’s what to know about such storms, and how they might be changing in our warming climate.

Global warming creates conditions more favorable to severe storms.

As the planet warms, severe storms of all kinds are likely to deliver even bigger payloads of rain. The reason: Warmer air holds more moisture, which effectively increases a storm’s capacity to carry precipitation.

Because the air can hold more moisture, that also means there is more water vapor in the sky that can condense into liquid, forming clouds. The heat energy released into the atmosphere by this condensation is what feeds thunderstorms. In short, more condensation, stronger storms.",planet warms severe storms kinds likely deliver even bigger payloads rain warmer air holds moisture effectively increases storms capacity carry precipitation,the United States,,TRV,215.40260314941406,215.8840789794922,211.84564208984375,212.4843292236328,0.2235236821832414,-1.8706506328482273,-1.6513082978403124,-1.3547997485234609

People in Tampa, especially, grew increasingly worried about a worst-case scenario landfall north of Tampa Bay at high tide, which would have delivered a historically destructive storm surge.

Milton quickly became one of the strongest storms ever.

Forecasters did not have Milton’s intensity right on that first go, and they assumed the storm would be a strong Category 2 at landfall. But they started dialing in on the possibility of a major hurricane, a 3 or higher, a few hours later. And that is exactly what happened: From Sunday to Monday, Milton grew from a tropical storm to one of the strongest storms ever in the Gulf of Mexico.

By 8 p.m. on Monday, its wind speeds had increased to 180 miles per hour. Based on wind speed, it joined a handful of other hurricanes that rivaled the strongest Atlantic storm ever recorded: a 1980 hurricane named Allen, which had a peak wind speed of 190 m.p.h. before it made landfall along the United States-Mexico border.

Another way to measure a storm’s strength is by how low the pressure becomes inside it. As hurricane hunter aircraft moved through Milton’s pinhole eye on Monday evening, they recorded a near-record low pressure of 897 millibars, joining only five other Atlantic hurricanes to dip below 900 millibars: Allen, Rita, the Labor Day storm of 1935, Gilbert in 1988 and Wilma.",sunday monday milton grew tropical storm one strongest storms ever gulf mexico joined handful hurricanes rivaled strongest atlantic storm ever recorded,the United States,,TRV,229.5660400390625,231.2818145751953,234.63401794433594,263.2665710449219,0.7473991082656911,1.4494020532041194,2.2076339794906428,14.680102945594637

The storm system, which was moving into Canada on Thursday, came five days after tornadoes whipped through Kentucky and five other states, killing at least 88 people, which might have prompted many people in the Midwest to take a cautious approach when faced with storms on Wednesday night.

What prompted the unusual December weather events is unclear. The ingredients that give rise to tornadoes include warm, moist air at ground level; cool dry air higher up; and wind shear, which is the change in wind speed or direction. Each of these factors may be affected differently by climate change.

Residents of communities across Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa were still struggling with widespread power outages on Thursday. Most were in Michigan, with more than 200,000 customers without power by the evening, according to PowerOutage.us, which aggregates data from utilities across the country.

Wind-driven fronts of flame that have stampeded across the landscape, often leapfrogging firebreaks. Even, possibly, a rare fire tornado.

The Bootleg Fire in Southern Oregon, spurred by months of drought and last month’s blistering heat wave, is the largest wildfire so far this year in the United States, having already burned more than 340,000 acres, or 530 square miles, of forest and grasslands.

And at a time when climate change is causing wildfires to be larger and more intense, it’s also one of the most extreme, so big and hot that it’s affecting winds and otherwise disrupting the atmosphere.

“The fire is so large and generating so much energy and extreme heat that it’s changing the weather,” said Marcus Kauffman, a spokesman for the state forestry department. “Normally the weather predicts what the fire will do.

And this is a moment when they have the potential to be particularly effective in the U.S., given the emergence of frightening coronavirus variants in other countries.

President Biden seems to realize this, and quickly reinstated some travel restrictions that President Donald Trump had lifted just before leaving office. But it’s not yet clear whether Biden is willing to impose the kind of strict rules that have worked best elsewhere. So far, he has not done so and instead chosen a middle ground between Trump’s approach and the approach with the best global track record.

Many of the places that have contained the virus have relied on travel restrictions. The list includes Australia, New Zealand, Ghana, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and Canada’s four Atlantic provinces. At key points, they imposed severe restrictions on who could enter.

But it still came as a shock when a Los Angeles Fire Department sport utility vehicle careened down a hill and landed in the Pacific Ocean on Thursday.

TV news footage captured the vehicle after it had plunged more than 20 feet with a fire inspector inside, swept away by a mud flow that had gushed in an instant down a fire-scarred mountain in Malibu, Calif. Once his vehicle turned upright after being tossed about by waves, the inspector cracked his door open, jumped out and trudged through muddy waters. He then clambered up the hill to safety, having the mental wherewithal to bring a bag and pair of shoes with him.

Somehow he emerged practically unscathed and was treated at a hospital with only minor injuries, fire officials said, without providing the inspector’s name. Still, it was one of the most dramatic scenes of a furious storm that caused flooding and mudslides in pockets of Southern California this week before it gave way to blue skies on Friday.

The storm turned some roads into rivers, sent muddy water cascading down hills and even briefly produced a tornado farther up the coast. On Friday, crews in Los Angeles County were working to clear roads and pick up more than 4,000 downed trees and branches, officials said.

On Sunday, President Biden dropped out of the presidential race, clearing the way for Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place, and it’s now highly likely that she will be running against former President Donald J. Trump in November.

Harris, as Lisa Friedman wrote, “has for years made the environment a top concern,” and earlier in her career took positions far to the left of Biden on climate change. She prosecuted polluters during her time as California’s attorney general, was an original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal as a senator and cast the tiebreaker that led to the passage in 2022 of the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate investment in U.S. history.

This is partly why Harris is widely expected to continue the work Biden started if she is elected.

The largest, by far, is the Smokehouse Creek fire, which became the state’s biggest fire in history and led to two deaths. A landowner lawsuit claims that the fire was started by a downed utility pole, though the state has not yet come to any conclusions about how the fire ignited. Thousands of cattle are feared dead, and wide swaths of land are charred, dealing a blow to ranchers and farmers who form the economic backbone of the region.

To find the most and least safe places in the United States, a new study by WalletHub scored 182 cities (including at least two of the largest in each state) across three categories of metrics. The “home and community safety” category examined crime statistics, police and rescue workers per capita, traffic and pedestrian safety, among other data. “Financial safety” scored each city on employment, job security, credit ratings, savings rates and the like. And the “natural disaster” category considered the risk of floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hail, hurricanes and wildfires.

Drilling down to some individual metrics helps paint a clearer picture. In the home and community safety category, Irvine, Calif., was found to have the fewest assaults per capita, though its heightened risk of natural disasters dropped it to 33rd overall. On the other end of the list, Little Rock, Ark., St. Louis, Detroit, Birmingham, Ala., Kansas City, Mo., and Memphis tied for the most assaults per capita — 86 times higher than in Irvine.

For natural disasters, the capital city of Dover, Del. — near the coast but tucked inland — had the lowest risk, but poor scores in home and financial safety sank it to 81st overall.

In early November, Judson Jones was checking the weather forecast when he noticed that a low-pressure system in the Atlantic Ocean was taking on the characteristic rotation of a tropical cyclone. A hurricane in November is rare, but Mr. Jones could read the signs: A powerful storm was forming. After all, as a meteorologist at The New York Times, it’s what he was hired to do.

Mr. Jones spoke to his boss, John Keefe, the lead editor of the Weather Data team, a group formed last year that is focused on covering extreme weather events. “I think we need to write this story,” Mr. Jones recalled telling Mr. Keefe. “This is really happening.”

So the Weather Data team, in close collaboration with The Times’s Graphics desk, began working on an interactive article, with maps and rainfall forecasts, that would track the progress of the system as it raced across the Atlantic, then turned into Hurricane Nicole by the time it hit the Bahamas. On Nov. 10, Nicole became the first hurricane to come ashore on Florida’s Atlantic coast since Katrina in 2005.

He also promised steep additional levies on dozens of countries that he claimed had been unfairly taking advantage of America. Here’s the latest.

Together, the new tariffs are by far Trump’s most expansive to date.

But one map comes close.

Each weekday morning at precisely 8:30, the Federal Emergency Management Agency releases what it calls its “hazards outlook” map, designed to show the threats expected in the coming days. The goal is to help emergency managers and other officials around the country prepare for what’s headed their way.

Lately, those maps have come to resemble abstract art, or just crayoning gone wild. On Monday, FEMA’s hazard map showed areas of heavy rain, freezing rain, heavy snow, heavy precipitation, hazardous cold, high winds and general severe weather. Seemingly just four of the 50 states were not facing some type of worrisome hazard.

By Thursday, the picture had somehow become even worse. In addition to heavy snow, heavy rain and high winds, a flood risk extended from the border between Maine and New Hampshire, all the way to Alabama.",fema releases hazards outlook map weekday morning goal help emergency managers officials prepare whats headed way,the United States,,TRV,190.60870361328125,191.28363037109375,192.40847778320312,193.1811981201172,0.35409020942812414,0.5880521035318864,0.9442245478849529,1.3496206931112515

Ventura County was hit hard overnight by a storm system that is moving along the California coast, with downtown Oxnard receiving a month’s worth of rainfall — more than 3 inches — in less than an hour, according to the National Weather Service in Los Angeles.

An evacuation order and evacuation warnings were issued in parts of the city of Port Hueneme in Ventura County. At 1:28 a.m., the National Weather Service issued tornado warnings for parts of Ventura County including Oxnard because of an intense thunderstorm, but no tornado was detected. Those warnings, and the evacuation order, have since been lifted.

The city of Oxnard said on Thursday that the heavy burst of rain had inundated many homes and roads, and that some parts of the county were still experiencing periods of “moderate” rain.

His home, in the town of Inglis, survived the storm, but his property was strewn with branches as he assessed the damage Wednesday morning. “It looks like somebody took a bunch of dynamite and threw it up on top of the trees,” he said.

The hurricane made landfall on Wednesday in a sparsely populated area of Florida known as the Big Bend, which includes Levy County. The region, a marshy collection of tiny fishing villages and a hub for clam farming, is where the north-south portion of the Florida peninsula curves toward the east-west portion of the Panhandle.

Many of the houses in the region are vacation rentals or second homes.

Cedar Key, which juts into the Gulf of Mexico, is “just like a little village lost in time,” said Michael Presley Bobbitt, a playwright who lives on one of the islands. “I’ve just always been obsessed with the history of the place, the quaint, slow pace of the place.”

But when Idalia passed over, it knocked down trees and pushed Gulf water onto the streets. A bridge to the community was flooded, trapping dozens of people there on Wednesday morning.

Mr. Bobbitt, 47, knew that Cedar Key’s mayor had begged people to leave on Tuesday. Still, he decided to stay. He figured that he might be able to help others who stayed behind. And his home was on high ground, he said; it remained intact after the storm passed.

“I felt like I had some resources here to be able to help folks,” Mr. Bobbitt said. “This storm was so serious that I knew that some of the people who were taking it lightly were going to be in trouble.”

For the most part, the holdouts seemed to be OK on Wednesday, he said. Many, like him, had been prepared with well-stocked pantries and fully fueled generators. About 100 people stayed behind, and they began their cleanup on Wednesday, he said.

But the commercial area could take a long time to recover from the storm, he said.

“Our little downtown shopping district, with our restaurants and our shops — 100 percent of those buildings are ruined,” Mr. Bobbitt said. “They’re all underwater, and I’d say probably approaching 50 percent of the houses on the island have water in them in some capacity or other.”

Just one week ago, Kenny Young had driven from central Florida to his home on Horseshoe Beach to help bring in new furniture, beds and curtains, planning to spruce up the fishing camp he and his wife purchased about two decades earlier. It was the only place on the water they could afford.

On Wednesday, Mr. Young, 61, was waiting with a generator, a chain saw, a cooler of ice and other supplies just minutes from the entrance to the small coastal community, which was still blocked off as officials began clearing debris and searching for anyone who weathered the hurricane on the beach.

Mr. Young still didn’t know what happened to his house; whether the windows he had always meant to put shutters on, but never did, had shattered; or whether the storm surge had damaged the stairs to his place.

“That water can do amazing things,” he said, adding, “But that’s totally out of my control.”",hurricane made landfall wednesday sparsely populated area florida known big bend many houses region vacation rentals second homes bridge community flooded trapping dozens people,Florida,,ALCO,23.489246368408203,23.380638122558594,23.23253631591797,23.41025733947754,-0.4623743314118487,-0.6334378294736547,-1.0928833069565647,-0.33627740835866127

The Sierra Avalanche Center warned that the danger of avalanches was high for the Central Sierra. Officials at Yosemite National Park said the park would remain closed through noon on Sunday. Many ski resorts in the region announced that they were closing at least for the day.

The storm system triggered a rare tornado that touched down in Madera, in central California, damaging an elementary school while students were inside on Friday, said Brian Ochs, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Hanford.

As showers and heavy snow continued Friday evening, more than 57,000 California customers had no electricity, according to PowerOutage.us.

This Weather Expert Can Help.,2023-06-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/24/fashion/weddings/meteorologist-wedding-weather.html,"Florida, Mass., Lake Como, Italy","We also look at the amount of rain. Does it rain a 10th of an inch between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. at one time throughout the week, or does it rain every day? If the venue is at the bottom of a hill, we’ll check if it normally floods.

Sounds more complicated than the weather report on the evening news. How do you explain what you do?

We’re tracking every radar possible, every reporting data possible, and creating a clear picture of what the weather will be on a specific day. That’s like turning the floodlights on in your backyard — you have a better idea of what’s actually there. We’ve taken that and wrote our own code to analyze all that data. We provide that information to wedding planners so they know what to expect, make accommodations and find creative solutions.

What are some other uses for a wedding meteorologist?

For a wedding in Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., we used marine data to look at the wave height to determine when boats should transport guests for the easiest ride with the most peaceful, calm waters. At what time will people become less seasick? We did it in Lake Como, Italy, too.

For a Florida wedding on the beach, a couple wanted to get married outside in the afternoon, but didn’t want guests to be sitting in direct sunlight or holding up parasols and blocking the view. We produced a sun study — looking at the topography of the land, trees on the property, angle of the sun, height of the house and the sun’s path — to choose the precise time to start the ceremony with the most shade. We produced a model with 15-minute increments between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.

We also ensured that the tide heights wouldn’t compete with chairs. When we looked at drone footage, it was so cool to see that the shade projected in the way we forecast months before.

How do you help couples with hairstyles?

As meteorologists, we should never ever suggest what people do with their hair. But we can give you all the information on wind, speed, humidity and temperature, so you can take that to a hair stylist. If someone has naturally frizzy hair in a humid climate, or they’re more likely to sweat that leads to oily hair, we can give them the context so they can plan.",meteorologists track every radar possible analyze data create clear picture weather specific day provide information wedding planners know expect make accommodations find creative solutions,Florida,,ALCO,25.088958740234375,24.891876220703125,25.148086547851562,25.187501907348633,-0.7855348704256703,1.0292929503455497,0.23567262487608184,0.39277503755557314

For a moment, it seems impossible that she will survive.

But then the brief video, which splashed across social media after being captured on Tuesday, records her salvation: a vehicle flashing emergency lights and veering toward her, a last-second chance of escape. The video ends as she reaches the door.

The witnesses who recorded the harrowing moments in the Cleveland National Forest in Riverside County, Calif., part of the Airport fire, were Josh Boothroyd, 34, and Xavier Perez, 21, of OC Hawk, an independent media collective that often sells its work to television. Operating under a state law that allows media workers to get much closer to disasters than other civilians, the two were filming the fire’s destructiveness to highlight the significance of what firefighters do.

In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Boothroyd said that the fire had jumped Ortega Highway, setting parts of the road itself on fire as it was surrounded by flames.

“Right as we were pushing back more, because the fire line was coming, I look over and I saw a figure fall, like someone walking,” Mr. Boothroyd said. “She tripped and fell. And I thought, ‘Who was that?’”

The woman has not been publicly named. Fire officials identified the rescuer as a Riverside County battalion chief, Mike Martinez.

It appeared to be Chief Martinez’s dedication to his firefighters, and a significant amount of luck, that put him in that terrifying place at just the moment to save the woman, who fire authorities said is being treated at a burn center.

It was about 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, near El Cariso Village, a tiny and isolated community in the national forest. The chief’s firefighters were retreating, forced back by the raging fire, and planning to regroup in a safer spot, according to Capt. Steve Concialdi of the Orange County Fire Authority. The area had already been placed under evacuation orders.

“He wanted to make sure all of the engine companies were out of the fire’s path,” Captain Concialdi said. “He was the last one out. And that’s when he saw her walking on Ortega Highway, coming out of the smoke and flame.”

Mr. Boothroyd, the videographer, said Chief Martinez’s vehicle appeared to be leaving — but then cut back and drove toward the figure in the flames.

Chief Martinez has been back out in the field in the days since the video was taken, commanding other units. In an interview with KABC in Los Angeles, he described the next few seconds. “I started screaming at her, ‘You need to get in! You need to get in!”



He said he opened the door and grabbed her, pulling her into the back seat.

Chief Martinez pulled the vehicle out of the flames, Captain Concialdi said, and then got a firefighter-paramedic to jump in and start treating her while the chief maneuvered the vehicle down the mountain. He called for an ambulance to meet them at the bottom, which took her to a hospital, Captain Concialdi said.

Mr. Boothroyd might have been speaking for many of those who watched the video when he said, “It was a surreal experience.

Cathy Smythe stood on the grounds of what had been her home on Altadena’s Alta Pine Drive, sifting through ash and rubble.

She and her husband had left in a hurry before the flames swept down from the nearby San Gabriel mountains, consuming their home of 24 years along with most of the surrounding houses.

Now she surveyed the damage.

“There’s a lot of memories in this house,” Ms. Smythe said, her voice cracking. “It’s hard to leave.”

About 100,000 people were ordered to evacuate this week in the face of the Eaton fire, hurriedly leaving homes, cars and prized possessions — the makings of entire lifetimes — amid howling winds driving an insatiable firestorm.

With the winds subsiding, at least temporarily, on Thursday, the still-raging fire eased away from Altadena and back into the foothills, giving residents their first chance to return.

Wildfires have long been a part of life here, but locals tend to think of them largely as the source of bothersome smoke. The Eaton fire upended that notion, destroying as many as 5,000 structures, leaving little behind but brick chimneys and the blasted-out carcasses of washing machines, barbecue grills and pickup trucks.

But Ms. Smythe discovered that the safe containing her first wedding ring had survived. She put the ring in her pocket.

Rosa Bugarín managed to save some personal documents but little else as she evacuated with her two children early Wednesday. They had lived in their Altadena house for 20 years, pouring their savings into a remodel as they turned an 800-square-foot bungalow into their dream home.

“I thought I was going to come back to my house very ashy and maybe trees fallen down,” she said. “But not burned down.”

José Nájera also hadn’t thought the fire would amount to much. He had left with his family around 3:30 a.m. Wednesday because of the smoke, before the flames had reached their home on Mountain View Street. He came back with relatives on Thursday to sift through the wreckage.

There was nothing to find. Mr. Nájera’s sister excitedly lifted a key from the jumble of metal, glass and ash — only to realize that whatever lock it opened was long gone.

A few houses down, Ariana Vasquez was leaving mounds of kibble and bowls of water around what remained of the gate outside her home, hoping the cats she had had to leave behind would return. She had also come looking for the urn holding her father’s ashes, but failed to find it.

Two sisters, Andrea and Greta Gurrola, stood together crying in the front yard of what had been their great-uncle’s house on Monterosa Drive, one of Altadena’s hardest-hit streets. All they found intact were a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe in the back of the house and a statue of Jesus.

Before coming back, the sisters had seen clips online of people making light of the devastation.

“I watched a TikTok Live of someone recording the burning, and they’re like, ‘Oh, eat the rich,’” Greta said.

Altadena did have some wealthy people, Greta acknowledged, but many here, like her great-uncle who came from Mexico, had put everything into their homes.

It doesn’t make any sense for how providers move throughout the health care system.”

Like members of all licensed professions in Canada, physicians are licensed and supervised by provinces and territories. That, Dr. Lafontaine said, brings considerable inflexibility to the system. Doctors who are available to work are unable to cross provincial borders to help when there’s a staffing shortage in another province — a particularly acute need in remote communities — or to fill in during gaps like parental leaves. Nor can they serve patients in other provinces using telehealth, Dr. Lafontaine said. If doctors were more mobile, they could reduce the need to fly patients to large regional hospitals.

Becoming licensed in other provinces is a formidable task. While it varies by province, just registering involves extensive paperwork, takes months and costs about 2,000 Canadian dollars for a single province. On top of that, there’s an annual fee. In Alberta’s case, for example, that comes to 2,200 dollars.

“It costs a lot of money to hold two licenses or three licenses,” Dr. Lafontaine said.

There have been recent developments to support Dr. Lafontaine’s optimism. On May 1, the four medical licensing bodies in Atlantic Canada will open a registry for doctors who want to work in any of the four provinces.

Bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush bloomed along Interstate 20, where signs warned visitors to “ARRIVE EARLY, STAY PUT, LEAVE LATE.”

The city, about 60 miles east of Dallas, is accustomed to influxes of crowds for a sprawling monthly shopping event that it bills as the world’s largest flea market.

Canton purchased 7,000 custom eclipse glasses for a partial eclipse last fall and today’s full solar eclipse, which it started planning for several years ago. But Monday’s forecast was for heavy cloud cover, and some maps showed possibilities of hail or tornadoes.

Brent and Jamie Driggers had driven to Texas from Hillsboro, Kan., a rural area about an hour’s drive north of Wichita. Ms. Driggers wore a T-shirt commemorating the family’s trip to Nebraska to view the 2017 total eclipse. She had been drawn to that eclipse by scientific curiosity, she said. But it was a more profound communal experience than she had expected, driving her to seek it out again.

“It went dark, and there was an intake of air,” she recalled. “I hope we’ll feel that community spirit.”

In the end, only a few dozen visitors, and about the same number of city employees, had gathered at the grassy grounds around the civic center by noon. Families unfolded camping chairs, unpacked picnics and set up cameras to capture the event, if their luck would hold.

“It’s just a total crapshoot,” said Don Kelly, a retired police officer who traveled from Baton Rouge, La., with his wife, Donna. “There’s no do-overs for whatever number of years. It’s now or never for some of us.”

Edgar Peréz kept his son Evan, 13, and daughter Ariana, 6, home from school to experience the eclipse. He hoped they would recognize “the celestial side of things,” he said.

“We’re just a small part of the universe,” he added.

The children spooned colorful icees from plastic foam cups and squinted up at the cloudy sky.

Around 12:30 p.m., the clouds parted. The moon edged in front of the sun. “It’s starting, it’s starting!” someone shouted. The clouds covered the sun again, and then parted again, over and over.

Meg Veitch, a geologist in Alabama, met up with her parents, Chris and Jim Veitch, who traveled from Berkeley, Calif. She was wearing a dress with a solar-system pattern, and checking her camera that she had propped up and covered with an $8 telescope cover in hopes of capturing the moment. As the sky got darker, the family brought out a round cake decorated like a cloudy, dark sky, and quietly sang “Happy Birthday” to Chris.

At 1:41 p.m., the sky went dark. There was a hush, then a cheer as the clouds parted again to reveal the spectacular sight of the moon perfectly centered in front of the sun. Then a hush again.

“It’s one of the longest and shortest moments of your life,” Meg Veitch said.

Afterward, Mr. Kelly walked slowly across the parking lot with a smile on his face. “I’ll have driven 12 hours and change for two seconds of eclipse,” he said. “I’d do it again tomorrow.”",canton purchased 70 custom eclipse glasses partial eclipse last fall todays full solar eclipse city 60 miles east dallas accustomed influxes crowds sprawling monthly shopping event,Calif.,,PCG,16.746387481689453,16.746387481689453,16.925710678100586,15.969341278076172,0.0,1.0708171933033634,1.0708171933033634,-4.640082551911006

At the time he made it, he was concerned that the city had lost its ability to inspire, roiled as it was by recession and crime. In resurfacing the skyline motif, Pesce strikes a hopeful note, reminding us that misery tends to be transitory. “I thought of the screen as not only functional but also an expression of positivity and optimism for a better world in the future,” he says.

The storm — with wind gusts surpassing 80 miles per hour — uprooted trees and damaged power lines and structures across southern and central Quebec and southern Ontario, Environment Canada, the government’s weather service, said.

On Sunday, a day before Canadians were to celebrate Victoria Day, scattered tree limbs still blocked roads and animals were trapped by pieces of splintered barns. Utility companies rushed to restore power for customers, some of whom had been in the dark for more than 12 hours.

A mandatory evacuation order was in effect for areas around the fire.

The Kenneth fire shows “we are absolutely not out of this extreme weather event,” said Kristin M. Crowley, the Los Angeles fire chief, at a news conference Thursday evening. Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles said she expected the newest fire to “rapidly spread.”

On the west side of Calabasas near the fire, the winds picked up and the smell of smoke was intense. The Parkmor neighborhood was pitch dark with the electricity, but just after sunset there was a glow above the clouds in the distance and the smoke looming overhead was pink.

“This is the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, you’re being advised to evacuate this area,” police announce through blasting speakers as they circle the streets again and again. “It is a mandatory evacuation.”

It’s an order that many residents, who have experienced fires before, are not heeding. In 2018, the area was hit by the Woolsey Fire. Many homes have since been rebuilt, but empty lots remain.

In one of those empty lots, Scott Zone was standing alongside neighbors. He was in disbelief that his neighborhood was under evacuation yet again. He lost his home in 2018 and rebuilt. “Never thought I’d see it again,” Mr. Zone said.

Marty Freel said he evacuated his family but was staying back to prepare his house. “I’ve been watering the roof the whole time and just waiting,” Mr. Freel said.

Tyler Turquand also endured the inferno about six years ago. He stayed back to save his home. “We have a tight community from that experience and we were able to get through this together,” Mr. Turquand said. “We’re doing OK.”

Mr. Turquand pointed to a ridge, covered in parched grass across that way.

“It was on this ridge here,” he said. “Came up, came down and burned down all of these homes, and it created a fire tornado in the canyon and came over the top. And then caught the house in the corner here and all the way down.”

“I know things can change in a heartbeat,” Mr. Turquand added. “Your life is precious. And just be careful because you never know.”",mandatory evacuation order effect areas around fire keneth fire shows absolutely extreme weather event fire chief says,Los Angeles,,TRV,241.7808380126953,231.4829559326172,232.37930297851562,235.96461486816406,-4.259180406818429,0.3872194573838762,-3.8884533246948365,-2.4055765512012393

What would you take and why? A framed photo? A family heirloom? A favorite souvenir, memento or trophy? A religious object? Some jewelry? Clothes? Your phone or computer?

For many people who survived the recent fires in Southern California, this was not a hypothetical question, but a painful reality.

In “What They Took,” New York Times editors share six stories from survivors of the Palisades and Eaton fires about what items they rescued from their homes and why they matter. Here is one of those stories — about Clarence Wright of Altadena, Calif., written by Ronda Kaysen:

After Clarence Wright fled his Altadena home and learned that it had been destroyed, he mourned the poems he had lost. In spiral-bound notebooks, he had chronicled the lives of his children, explored his political leanings and mused about romance, friendship or a stranger at the airport. The only poems he had left, he thought, were in three copies of a collection that he self-published 20 years ago. He had long kept those in his car so that he could reread his work on trips to the beach or the mountains. “I would like to remind myself of who I am and who I was and where I came from,” said Mr. Wright, 75, who lived in his three-bedroom house for 40 years, raising four of his children alone after his wife died at an early age. But as the fog of crisis recently lifted, he remembered that his spiral-bound notebooks might have survived after all. It turned out that they were in a backpack that he had grabbed in the frantic early morning evacuation. The backpack had been sitting in his trunk for weeks. “I was relieved because I thought that everything that I’d ever done would not exist anymore,” he said. For Mr. Wright, the fire and its aftermath have resurfaced painful memories of his time as a Marine in Vietnam. He is now working on a new poem to make sense of those feelings after his home and community were destroyed. “It brings out sort of an anger,” he said. “But in order to control that anger, I put it in words.” — Ronda Kaysen

Temporary evacuation centers for animals had opened, including one at Alaqua Animal Refuge, in Florida’s Northern Panhandle, which began receiving animals from coastal areas at risk of flooding. Even small shelters were taking in animals, wherever they had spare kennels.

Hurricanes are categorized by their wind speeds on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, which provides useful information on the storm’s winds, their expected impact and potential damage.

Hurricane Helene was nearing the coast of Florida as a Category 3 storm on Thursday evening and was expected to make landfall as a Category 4.

Hurricanes are split into five categories based on the wind speeds they generate:

Category 1: winds between 74 miles per hour and 95 m.p.h. These are considered “very dangerous winds” that will cause some damage, even tearing the roofs of “well-constructed frame homes,” and taking shingles, vinyl siding and gutters, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Category 2: winds between 96 m.p.h. and 110 m.p.h. Hurricanes at this level carry “extremely dangerous winds” that will cause vast damage, including major damage to roofs and siding and uprooting trees. A near-total loss of power is expected.

Category 3: winds between 111 m.p.h. and 129 m.p.h. This is the level at which a hurricane is considered “major,” according to the Hurricane Center, and its wind speeds indicate that “devastating damage will occur.” Homes might see major damage, such as the removal of roof decking and gable ends. Snapped or uprooted trees might block roads, while electricity and water will likely be unavailable for days or even weeks.

Category 4: winds between 130 m.p.h. and 156 m.p.h. Catastrophic damage is expected, with homes sustaining severe damage that can include losing their roofs and some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles will be downed, causing residential areas to become isolated, according to the Hurricane Center. Power outages are expected to last weeks or even months, and most of the area will be uninhabitable for that period.

Category 5: winds of 157 m.p.h. and greater. At this point, “a high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse,” according to the Hurricane Center. There will be fallen trees and downed power poles, isolating residential areas with power outages lasting for weeks or months. As with a Category 4, most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.

Extreme heat in June and July was the most likely cause of the fire’s rapid growth, said Park Williams, a professor of geography at the University of California, Los Angeles. “It’s the record-breaking hot and dry weather that’s singed the fuels and made them as ready to burn as they could possibly be,” Dr. Williams said.

The researchers drew upon information from previous studies of how the property damage from past hurricanes that hit the United States varied in response to where the storms came ashore and their maximum wind speeds.

High winds aren’t the only cause of destruction during a hurricane: Flooding, storm surge and tornadoes matter, too. But small-seeming jumps in a hurricane’s wind speeds can translate into big increases in damage, said Ralf Toumi, a climate scientist at Imperial College London who worked on the analysis.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a hurricane’s potential damage in the United States rises by roughly a factor of four for every increase in the storm’s category rating. Milton made landfall this week as a Category 3 storm.

Think about it this way, Dr. Toumi said: In the chaos of a hurricane, the damage multiplies.

Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for 1991 through 2020 show that the Eastern part of the country received more rain, on average, over those years than it did during the 20th century. At the same time, precipitation decreased across the West.

The sharp east-west divide is consistent with predictions from climate scientists, who expect wet places to get wetter, and dry areas to get drier, as the world warms.

While no individual storm can be tied to climate change without further analysis, warming air can result in heavier rainfall.

On Tuesday, we started looking at the forecast models. The high resolution model only goes out 18 hours, so you only start to get a glimpse. Then the National Weather Service forecasters were mentioning it. By Wednesday morning, as soon as the sun rose, there was this huge concentration of smoke. The models were showing it staying together as this big, dense mass, and moving.

It actually arrived about three hours earlier than I expected. The fact you could see this mass of smoke moving like a blob was freaky. The time-lapse Earth camera we very quickly put out was apocalyptic. It’s like putting on a giant Instagram filter, or in this case it was like you photoshopped out all the buildings.

Are there any ideas you have for different ways to cover weather events as they become more consistent and impactful?

Our weather team likes to work with all the teams across the board at The Times. We don’t like to keep things to ourselves. That’s what makes us dynamic. Our team has already been working hand in hand with the folks that have built our wildfire tracker. Air quality and the smoke forecast are all products that came out of this group. We’ve been thinking through how we cover this better, how we inform our readers, how we give them something tangible and how we explain how that affects them.

But discerning the relationship between any given flood and climate change is no small feat, experts say, made difficult by limited historical records, particularly for the most extreme floods, which occur infrequently.

It can be tempting to attribute all floods and other extreme events to the forces of warming planet. But weather is not climate, even though weather can be affected by climate. For example, scientists are confident that climate change makes unusually hot days more common. They’re not as sure that climate change is making tornadoes more severe.

Floods fall somewhere along the confidence spectrum between heat waves (“yes, clearly”) and tornadoes (“we don’t know yet”), said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at University of California, Los Angeles. “I’d say, ‘yes, probably, but…’”",floods surge year round every region world discerning relationship given flood climate change small feat scientists confident climate change makes unusually hot days common,Los Angeles,,TRV,151.35426330566406,152.18679809570312,150.38926696777344,149.5945281982422,0.5500570462014247,-1.181134730753258,-0.6375745993634739,-1.162659755323867

It was about 4 in the afternoon on Wednesday on the East Coast when chaos struck online. Dozens of the biggest names in America — including Joseph R. Biden Jr., Barack Obama, Kanye West, Bill Gates and Elon Musk — posted similar messages on Twitter: Send Bitcoin and the famous people would send back double your money.

It was all a scam, of course, the result of one of the most brazen online attacks in memory.

A first wave of attacks hit the Twitter accounts of prominent cryptocurrency leaders and companies. But soon after, the list of victims broadened to include a Who’s Who of Americans in politics, entertainment and tech, in a major show of force by the hackers.

Twitter quickly removed many of the messages, but in some cases similar tweets were sent again from the same accounts, suggesting that Twitter was powerless to regain control.

The company eventually disabled broad swaths of its service, including the ability of verified users to tweet, for a couple of hours as it scrambled to prevent the scam from spreading further. The company sent a tweet saying that it was investigating the problem and looking for a fix. “You may be unable to Tweet or reset your password while we review and address this incident,” the company said in a second tweet.

Debby is certainly loaded with a lot of water. One big reason: The waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean have been abnormally hot for months. This warmth causes more of the water to evaporate, providing storms with more moisture to unleash as rain. The extra heat in the ocean also gives storms more energy with which they could potentially generate stronger winds.

But other factors stopped Debby’s winds from intensifying to the highest levels, said Kim Wood, an associate professor of hydrology and atmospheric sciences at the University of Arizona. Before making landfall in Florida this week, the storm crossed Cuba, where the mountainous terrain very likely disrupted the low-level winds that channel energy from the sea surface into the storm.

“The water was plenty warm, but the storm itself had to be organized,” Dr. Wood said.

The fact that hurricanes can vary so much in how they cause harm makes communicating the risks tricky, said Jennifer Collins, a professor of geosciences at the University of South Florida.",gulf mexico caribbean abnormally hot months warmth causes water evaporate providing storms moisture unleash rain,Florida,,ALCO,27.282346725463867,28.505725860595703,27.39175796508789,27.351970672607422,4.4841418791514736,-3.907874161687926,0.4010330955947602,0.2551977945451865

Phil Klotzbach, a researcher at Colorado State University, said that this year’s season was likely to be an above-average — but not hyperactive — one.

In his team’s annual forecast on Thursday, the researchers said they expected a hectic season of 17 named storms, including nine hurricanes — four of them potentially reaching major status, meaning Category 3 or higher. In a typical season, there are 14 named storms with seven hurricanes, three of them major.

Vance: ‘He’s Our Barack Obama’,2024-07-16,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/09/opinion/thepoint/vance-ohio-republican-convention,"America, Alberta","Donald Trump accepted the Republican nomination for president, and he gave a speech. Prior to giving the speech, there was talk that he would be a somber and chastened Trump, someone who has just experienced a life-or-death moment and has come from it with a newfound appreciation for unity. He now understands the gravity of the office he is campaigning for once again. And at the beginning of the speech, there was a little bit of this, right? He said the words, “I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America.” You have to balance statements like this against the fact that his campaign also distributed signs saying, “Mass deportation now,” which is not something you do if you’re all that interested in unity. But nonetheless, Trump said he wanted unity. But after this pro forma talk of unity, after going through a description of the attempt on his life, Trump returned to the guy we recognize on the political stage since 2015, someone whose vision is dark and disturbing, who attacks his opponents as existential threats to the nation. He warned that “our planet is teetering on the edge of World War III.” He spoke of a migrant invasion. “There’s never been an invasion like this anywhere. Third world countries would fight with sticks and stones not to let this happen.” He referred to Nancy Pelosi as “crazy Nancy Pelosi.” He said that Democrats were going to try to cheat and steal the election. “If Democrats want to unify our country, they should drop these partisan witch hunts, which I have been going through for approximately eight years. And they should do that without delay and allow an election to proceed that is worthy of our people. We’re going to win it anyway.” He engaged in a riff that we saw him engage in during the debate, where he warned that illegal immigrants were “taking the jobs from our Black population.” All the things we’ve seen before — playing the greatest hits, you might say. But one thing that was unusual about this performance onstage: that even as he was playing these hits, even as he was engaged in genuinely divisive rhetoric, he was very sedate, not somber. Not somber. Somber is an attitude. Sedate is an affect. And he was sedate. He was unable to summon the kind of energy we’ve seen before. You could even say that he was a bit low energy, to borrow a Trumpism. There was none of the excitement we’ve often seen, when he was engaged in this kind of riffing. And this was riffing. Although there was a speech on the teleprompter, Trump ignored it for long stretches, going on these tangents that were genuinely hard to follow and often quite incoherent. “By the way, you know, who’s taking the jobs, the jobs that are created? One hundred and seven percent of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens.” If you were going to judge this like a theater critic, you might say that this acceptance speech was one of the worst ever given by president accepting a nomination. It was striking. On his podcast, my colleague Ezra Klein spoke to the reporter Tim Alberta about the Trump 2024 campaign. And one of the things that struck me in the interview is that Alberta mentions “the key contrast in this campaign that the Trump people have been trying to engineer and optimize and operationalize from Day 1 is strength versus weakness.” But on that nomination stage, Trump did not look strong. He looked halting, hesitant and down tempo. He should have looked the worst of all worlds, both very divisive, as usual, but not even divisive in an exciting way, divisive in a way that strongly signaled that he may also not have the energy to be president for another four years. Now, given who his opponent is, this might not be an issue, but we’re at this stage where it’s not actually clear that the incumbent president is going to be his direct competitor in the election in the fall. And if he does have to go up against someone younger, more vital, that “Trump strong” message may not land the way the campaign wants it to.",donald trump accepted republican nomination president julian zelizer talk would somber chastened trump returned guy recognize political stage since 2015 zelizer says,America,,TRV,210.7229461669922,215.05789184570312,218.03013610839844,205.12408447265625,2.0571778050576475,1.3820670504981043,3.4676764321696134,-2.6569777027979633

Stifling heat and humidity are forecast to engulf much of the central United States through the weekend, like a great sweaty slash stretching from the northern Rockies through the Deep South.

Temperatures will be about five to 10 degrees above average in cities from Minneapolis to Des Moines to Dallas — not setting records in most places, but feeling like it in parts of the country with high humidity.

An extensive heat wave will consume the Central US for the next few days. Widespread excessive heat warnings and heat advisories stretch from MT into the South with the potential for a few record high temperatures in the north-central High Plains.https://t.co/VyWINDk3xP pic.twitter.com/UBhjNsYM8d — National Weather Service (@NWS) July 27, 2021

It won’t just be unseasonably hot, though. Smoke from West Coast wildfires will continue to soar into the upper atmosphere, spreading haze and unhealthy air across the continent to New England, where health warnings were issued Tuesday.

At the edge of the high-pressure “heat dome” locking in the sweltering temperatures, severe thunderstorms are predicted around the Great Lakes and into parts of the Northeast this week, bringing lightning, wind gusts, hail, flash flooding and a risk of tornadoes, the National Weather Service said. And monsoon rains will continue to bring the possibility of flash floods to the Southwest, although chances of that will recede later in the week.

About the only good news: Rain showers in California and Oregon helped temporarily slow the growth of the nation’s two largest wildfires, which have together scorched an area larger than three New York Cities. But hot, dry weather is expected to return later this week. All of this comes as most of the Western United States — despite the monsoon rains, which even brought rare summer showers to Los Angeles this week — remains severely dry. Extreme conditions are more widespread than at any point in at least 20 years, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. And the hottest part of the summer could still be to come. What’s the climate connection to all of this? Human emissions of gases that trap heat in the atmosphere have raised baseline temperatures nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit on average since 1900. Last year was the warmest on record, and the past seven years have been the warmest in recorded history. That makes extreme summer temperatures, like the ones the United States has experienced this year, more likely and frequent. “This is about as good as it’s going to get if we don’t get global warming under control,” Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Michigan, recently told The New York Times. Despite that, most of the country can expect some cooling off by the weekend — except for the Deep South, where it could be early next week before thunderstorms help break the heat.

Bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush bloomed along Interstate 20, where signs warned visitors to “ARRIVE EARLY, STAY PUT, LEAVE LATE.”

The city, about 60 miles east of Dallas, is accustomed to influxes of crowds for a sprawling monthly shopping event that it bills as the world’s largest flea market.

Canton purchased 7,000 custom eclipse glasses for a partial eclipse last fall and today’s full solar eclipse, which it started planning for several years ago. But Monday’s forecast was for heavy cloud cover, and some maps showed possibilities of hail or tornadoes.

Brent and Jamie Driggers had driven to Texas from Hillsboro, Kan., a rural area about an hour’s drive north of Wichita. Ms. Driggers wore a T-shirt commemorating the family’s trip to Nebraska to view the 2017 total eclipse. She had been drawn to that eclipse by scientific curiosity, she said. But it was a more profound communal experience than she had expected, driving her to seek it out again.

“It went dark, and there was an intake of air,” she recalled. “I hope we’ll feel that community spirit.”

In the end, only a few dozen visitors, and about the same number of city employees, had gathered at the grassy grounds around the civic center by noon. Families unfolded camping chairs, unpacked picnics and set up cameras to capture the event, if their luck would hold.

“It’s just a total crapshoot,” said Don Kelly, a retired police officer who traveled from Baton Rouge, La., with his wife, Donna. “There’s no do-overs for whatever number of years. It’s now or never for some of us.”

Edgar Peréz kept his son Evan, 13, and daughter Ariana, 6, home from school to experience the eclipse. He hoped they would recognize “the celestial side of things,” he said.

“We’re just a small part of the universe,” he added.

The children spooned colorful icees from plastic foam cups and squinted up at the cloudy sky.

Around 12:30 p.m., the clouds parted. The moon edged in front of the sun. “It’s starting, it’s starting!” someone shouted. The clouds covered the sun again, and then parted again, over and over.

Meg Veitch, a geologist in Alabama, met up with her parents, Chris and Jim Veitch, who traveled from Berkeley, Calif. She was wearing a dress with a solar-system pattern, and checking her camera that she had propped up and covered with an $8 telescope cover in hopes of capturing the moment. As the sky got darker, the family brought out a round cake decorated like a cloudy, dark sky, and quietly sang “Happy Birthday” to Chris.

At 1:41 p.m., the sky went dark. There was a hush, then a cheer as the clouds parted again to reveal the spectacular sight of the moon perfectly centered in front of the sun. Then a hush again.

“It’s one of the longest and shortest moments of your life,” Meg Veitch said.

Afterward, Mr. Kelly walked slowly across the parking lot with a smile on his face. “I’ll have driven 12 hours and change for two seconds of eclipse,” he said. “I’d do it again tomorrow.”",canton purchased 70 custom eclipse glasses partial eclipse last fall todays full solar eclipse city 60 miles east dallas accustomed influxes crowds sprawling monthly shopping event,Calif.,,PCG,16.746387481689453,16.746387481689453,16.925710678100586,15.969341278076172,0.0,1.0708171933033634,1.0708171933033634,-4.640082551911006

The couple had already upsized from a one-bedroom to a two-bedroom in the neighborhood, where Mrs. McCants attended Columbia Business School, thinking it would serve for at least a few years as the children grew. But it was clear that they needed more space, and the garbage tornado served as a wake-up call. The couple left Manhattan for White Plains, N.Y., the Westchester city where Mr. McCants’s family owned a three-bedroom house inherited from his grandparents.

It was an ideal starter home, with many of his relatives living nearby. (Mrs. McCants is from San Jose, Calif.) The Metro-North express train made for an easy commute to the city, where Mrs. McCants, 38, now leads the social impact team at Peloton. Mr. McCants, also 38, works remotely as a business analyst for a telecom company.

“The house was really old and wasn’t really ours,” he said. A sticking point was the single bathroom, which had little storage space and no bathtub.

[Did you recently buy or rent a home in the New York metro area? We want to hear from you. Email: thehunt@nytimes.com]

Mrs. McCants dreamed of having a second bathroom. Mr. McCants wanted enough space to entertain relatives. The children wanted a yard where they could run and play.

“I am from an apartment family, so the idea of owning my own house was a little mysterious to me,” said Mr. McCants, who grew up in nearby Port Chester and was daunted by the idea of fancy lawns with topiary. “I am used to having a stoop and not a lot of shrubbery, and I wasn’t looking forward to having to maintain that.”

Mrs. McCants belongs to the Westchester chapter of Mocha Moms, a group for mothers of color, and late last summer a fellow member directed her to Patrice Footes, an associate broker at Coldwell Banker, in White Plains. Ms. Footes suggested that the couple visit open houses to get ideas. “She was like a guide in the wilderness of home buying,” Mrs. McCants said.

Their price range was broad: from the mid $600,000s to the low $900,000s. But staying in the same school district for their son and daughter, now both 7, was a priority — which made the hunt tough, with so few houses on the market, Ms. Footes said.

The McCantses focused on the Battle Hill neighborhood, where the housing stock tends toward “colonials or Tudors built around 100 years ago,” Ms. Footes said. “And there were no powder rooms or main-floor bathrooms,” she said, although additional bathrooms were commonly added over time. Many of the houses had attics and partially finished basements, and the yards sometimes came with an unwelcome surprise: a private well or an underground oil tank, an environmental risk.

Today, the world responded.

The S&P 500 suffered its worst day since 2020, falling 4.8 percent. Some tech stocks like Apple and Amazon fell further. Markets in Asia and Europe pulled back. Business groups, trade experts, Democratic lawmakers and even a few Republicans denounced the tariffs.

Trump insisted this afternoon that the long-term payoff of the tariffs will be worth it. “The markets are going to boom,” he said. “The country is going to boom.”

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the United States has experienced four climate disasters since May, each causing over a billion dollars in damages. The National Park Service estimates that more visitors have died of heat-related causes since June than do in an average year. The indirect toll is almost certainly higher: A recent study found that summer heat waves killed 61,000 people in Europe last year.

Summer trips have long been treasured. Sure, airport lines are longer and hotel rooms go quicker, but school’s out, the sun’s out and beaches beckon. Summer travel cuts across social class; whether you go to a state fair or Sardinia, you cash in precious vacation days. You suntan, you eat more indulgently and reach for your wallet with less angst. Travel helps you hide from reality, or at least pause it for a bit.

But even if the idea of a summer getaway remains culturally resilient, is it still practical? Where to go is certainly less obvious — you can’t hide from reality when reality is 100-degree seawater, or a raging wildfire.

For decades, science has confirmed that unabated climate change will cause more misery, more hardship and cost millions of lives in the years to come. We’re getting a taste of the results this summer. Our relationship to travel has reached a tipping point. What happens when we can’t just vacation through it?

In fact, he said, he earns less than $100,000 per year at U.C.L.A.’s Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, where he is evaluated on his academic research and publication, not his public communication. His online “office hours,” during which he explains current extreme weather to journalists, colleagues and members of the public, are mostly unpaid.

The ARkStorm scenario was first modeled in 2010, and the term stands for “atmospheric river 1,000-year storm,” referring to an event initially considered so unlikely that the U.S. Geological Survey viewed it as a one-in-1,000-year event. Dr. Swain and a colleague, Xingying Huang, now believe that climate change has increased the odds of a California megaflood so dramatically that most Californians can now expect to experience one.

Ms. Langlois said her ARkStorm post had been inspired by a meteorology enthusiast — a “risk manager/broker by day, weather junkie by night,” according to his bio — who, earlier in the day, had described this week’s forecast using the term.

“I’m just a layperson, one of hundreds of millions in this country, watching scary, extreme weather become the new normal,” she explained in an email. “I shared information that I thought people needed in a way that I hoped would help people grasp the seriousness of this potential threat.”",arkstorm scenario first modeled 2010 term stands atmospheric river 10year storm dr swain colleague believe climate change increased odds,California,,PCG,16.795839309692383,17.044740676879883,16.576807022094727,16.178565979003906,1.4819227702652906,-2.7453257497773422,-1.3040865869159584,-3.6751562056935514

The storms Stewart contemplated from his home with a view toward San Francisco Bay were not just meteorological. If “Storm” seems dark, he notes in his introduction, “remember that the text was largely written during those grim and terrible months of Dunkirk and the fall of France.” But by looking down on society from the height of a tempest, he frames all human and animal lives — earnest and ignorant, shaped by forces they forget to consider — as being on the same side as they strive for meaning and survival. A fur trader spits on the ground. An owl is electrocuted by a power line. A boar — named Blue Boy, after a boar in a Will Rogers movie — drowns in a gully, and his body blocks a culvert that delays a train. A telephone worker transmits the sound of the minister of Thailand’s cough.

“Storm” is a product of its era in ways both troubling and benign. Stewart sometimes invokes ethnic slurs and stereotypes, particularly disturbing for a book whose central — if subtle — moral is that we all ought to get along. The book has been called the first eco-novel, and falls prey to a common shortcoming of the genre, at least among white American writers: An author fancies himself neutral, capable of the pleasant illusion of stepping outside humanity, and thus projects his cultural biases onto nature itself.

“Storm” is also a testament to attention spans of the past; it’s hard to imagine a novel with more science than plot selling a million copies today. For the first few chapters, I felt I was reading a highly unusual textbook, albeit an often beautiful one. But by the middle of the book, the humans in their small lives seemed dear, and I rooted for each as I would for, say, a hamster digging in shavings for a pellet of lost food. “You know so little!” I wanted to tell them. “But you’re cute! I know you can figure it out, probably.”

What would “Storm” look like if written now? What metaphor would it take to make the argument that all people — all Americans, even — are on the same side? Whom does that fantasy comfort, and whom does it hurt? Meteorology won’t do it. In an era of climate change, the idea that weather is the one thing humans can’t influence seems quaint, and the thought that we might instinctually band together against an existential threat, naïve. If there’s hope here, it’s that we do matter — small as we are, and short-lived, passing like clouds through the air. The world rolls on regardless.

Logistics. If I’m traveling somewhere for an assignment, I have to think through questions like: How long will it take me to drive there? Where am I staying? If there’s a weather-related emergency, will I have electricity? When I covered Hurricane Helene, for example, there were several places that didn’t have power, cell service, running water or a combination of all three.

Another challenge is that people may not understand how this job works. It was one thing when I was on the Hill, where lawmakers understand what it means to talk to a reporter. But in the South, a lot of people have never considered being covered in The New York Times. For people to open up to me — a conduit to thousands or even millions of readers — is a huge ask. Explaining to sources how our jobs work, and then convincing them that we are worthy of telling their story in The Times, is an important challenge.

What’s the reaction you get when you tell people you work for The Times?

“You flew all the way from New York City? What are you doing here?”

There will always be people who distrust The Times, but I think it helps to be a reporter who lives near them. I can’t claim to be a lifelong Southerner — as someone from Miami, Florida — but I think it can be viewed differently when I say that I’m from Nashville.

But being proactive about that is extremely difficult.”

In basic terms, eastern Spain was flooded this week because of a cutoff low: an area of low pressure that breaks away from the jet stream, the fast-moving current of wind that meanders west to east across the globe’s temperate regions.

When a cutoff low forms in the Gulf of Cádiz off southern Spain, it produces winds that blow warm, moist air from above the Mediterranean Sea toward the country’s eastern coast. This moisture-laden air hits the mountains and is pushed skyward, condensing into clouds that dump rain onto coastal areas including the province of Valencia.

Normally the jet stream would whisk such weather systems away relatively quickly. But because cutoff lows are detached from those winds, they can linger in place, blasting the same places with rain for days and days.",cutoff low area low pressure breaks away jet stream jet stream fastmoving current wind meanders across globe cutoff lows linger place blasting places,Spain,,ITX.MC,52.29999923706055,52.68000030517578,52.040000915527344,52.540000915527344,0.7265794907430133,-1.214881142636512,-0.49712872911279987,0.45889422938409563

California has long cycled through spells of deluge and drought, in part because of natural climate variability. But research suggests that a warmer climate has supercharged the “whiplash” between these extremes.

Second, even an extremely wet winter isn’t a magic bullet for the long-term water concerns in the state, which have been exacerbated by years of extreme aridity, rising temperatures and unsustainable water use.

California’s groundwater aquifers have huge potential for storing water; they can hold eight to 12 times as much as all of the state’s major reservoirs combined. But, they have been badly depleted by decades of heavy pumping, especially in the agriculture-heavy Central Valley. Data suggests that groundwater supplies in the region decline precipitously during dry periods, recovering only modestly during wet ones.

When it comes to replenishing those aquifers, the state has had trouble capturing water from downpours and redirecting it to fields and sandy basins where it can seep underground, experts say. That means we still have a long way to go in restoring our groundwater supplies.

Heavy influxes of rain and snow during the winter can also have destructive repercussions later in the year. The state’s record-level snowpack could mean more flooding in the spring as the snow melts, especially if much of the soil is already saturated with water and can’t absorb much more of it.",even extremely wet winter isnt magic bullet longterm water concerns state states recordlevel snowpack could mean flooding spring snow melts,California,,PCG,15.463057518005371,15.21429443359375,15.562561988830566,16.08993911743164,-1.6087574150323012,2.2890812108107244,0.6434980320633944,4.054059804772252

Last summer, Jen Percy, a contributing writer at The New York Times Magazine, came across a peculiar video of an opossum pretending to be dead. The animal was actually involuntarily paralyzed, in a state known as apparent death, a biological response in many animals most often initiated by a predatory attack.

I wonder if humans do that too, she thought.

A few weeks later, she read a victim statement by Jessica Mann, an actress who testified that Harvey Weinstein had raped her. In the statement, Ms. Mann described feeling “immobile.” Her description of the encounter sent Ms. Percy on a quest to understand those feelings of paralysis as they relate to the experiences of other victims of sexual assault.

Re “The Staggering Cost of America’s Nuclear Gamble,” by W.J. Hennigan (Opinion, “At the Brink” series, Oct. 13):

Mr. Hennigan says, almost in passing, that “nuclear weapons do deter our adversaries.”

There is a lot to unpack in these six words. There certainly are situations in which one country’s nuclear weapons do deter its adversaries. Russia’s threats to use its nuclear weapons have clearly deterred the United States and NATO from doing more to support Ukraine.

But does deterrence guarantee that these weapons will not be used? Because a failure of deterrence will cause a catastrophe beyond reckoning.

A nuclear war between the United States and Russia could kill hundreds of millions of people in the first afternoon, and the ensuing climate disruption and famine could kill three-quarters of humanity over the next two years. Is there any conceivable benefit that can be derived from possessing these weapons that is worth running this terrible risk?

One morning in November 2018, Jim Wilson was on a three-hour drive to Paradise, Calif., to cover the Camp fire, which would turn out to be the deadliest fire in California history. The fire had just ripped through 17 miles of wooded foothills in 12 hours, catching Paradise by surprise. Mr. Wilson, a New York Times photographer based in Oakland, was going through a checklist in his head. He had packed his fire-resistant Nomex clothing, his helmet and an emergency fire blanket. But what about the things he couldn’t anticipate?

“It’s important to understand that you are taking a risk when you go into these areas,” Mr. Wilson said, “and to have some sort of a plan for what happens if you get blocked in on the road by a fallen tree, or you get flat tires.”

A fire can move rapidly in unpredictable paths and with varying intensity, and reporters are often sent to cover them on short notice. The golden rule is to plan ahead.

The current shortage occurred when flooding coursed through western North Carolina and damaged a Baxter plant, which is now closed for cleaning. The plant makes about 60 percent of the United States’ supply of fluids used in IVs, for in-home dialysis and for people who rely on IV nutrition. They include premature babies in intensive care and patients who rely on tube feeding to survive.

The situation could become even more dire now that Hurricane Milton is hitting Florida. On Tuesday, workers at B.

Temperatures were expected to range from 105 degrees in Las Vegas to nearly 120 degrees in Death Valley.

While tying a single heat wave to climate change requires extensive attribution analysis, heat waves around the world are growing more frequent, longer lasting and more dangerous. The 2018 National Climate Assessment, a major scientific report issued by 13 federal agencies, notes that the number of hot days is increasing, and the frequency of heat waves in the United States jumped from an average of two per year in the 1960s to six per year by the 2010s. Also, the season for heat waves has stretched to be 45 days longer than it was in the 1960s, according to the report.

It is all part of an overall warming trend: The seven warmest years in the history of accurate worldwide record-keeping have been the last seven years, and 19 of the 20 warmest years have occurred since 2000; worldwide, June 2019 was the hottest ever recorded and June 2020 essentially tied it.

First, there are the limits of ideological box-checking in a campaign against Trump. This is my colleague Nate Cohn’s main point in his assessment of DeSantis’s recent struggles, and it’s a good one: DeSantis has spent the year to date accumulating legislative victories that match up with official right-wing orthodoxy, but we already saw in Ted Cruz’s 2016 campaign the limits of ideological correctness. There are Republican primary voters who cast ballots with a matrix of conservative positions in their heads but not enough to overcome the appeal of the Trump persona, and a campaign against him won’t prosper if its main selling point is just True Conservatism 2.0.

Second, there’s the mismatch between cultural conservatism and the anti-Trump donor class. Part of DeSantis’s advantage now, compared with Cruz’s situation in 2016, is that he has seemed more congenial to the party’s bigger-money donors. But many of those donors don’t really like the culture war; they’ll go along with a generic anti-wokeness, but they hate the Disney battles, and they’re usually pro-choice. So socially conservative moves that DeSantis can’t refuse, like signing Florida’s six-week abortion ban, yield instant stories about how his potential donors are thinking about closing up their checkbooks, with a palpable undercurrent of “Why can’t we have Nikki Haley or even Glenn Youngkin instead?”

This leads to the third dynamic that could repeat itself: The G.O.P coordination problem, a.k.a. the South Carolina pileup. Remember how smoothly all of Joe Biden’s rivals suddenly exited the presidential race when it was time to stop Bernie Sanders? Remember how nothing remotely like that happened among Republicans in 2016? Well, if you have an anti-Trump donor base dissatisfied with DeSantis and willing to sustain long-shot rivals, and if two of those rivals, Haley and Senator Tim Scott, hail from the early primary state of South Carolina, it’s easy enough to see how they talk themselves into hanging around long enough to hand Trump exactly the sort of narrow wins that eventually gave him unstoppable momentum in 2016.

But then again, a certain cast of mind has declared Trump to have unstoppable momentum already. This reflects another tendency that helped elect him the first time, the weird fatalism of professional Republicans. In 2016 many of them passed from “he can’t win” to “he can’t be stopped” with barely a way station in between. A rough month for DeSantis has already surfaced the same spirit — as in a piece by Politico’s Jonathan Martin, which quoted one strategist saying resignedly, “We’re just going to have to go into the basement, ride out the tornado and come back up when it’s over to rebuild the neighborhood.”

Influencing this perspective, again as in 2016, is the assumption that Trump can’t win the general election, so if the G.O.P. just lets him lose it will finally be rid of him. Of course, that assumption was completely wrong before, it could be wrong again; and even if it’s not, how do you know he won’t be back in 2028?",ruben navarete desantis spent year date accumulating legislative victories match official rightwing orthodoxy says limits ideological boxchecking campaign trump navar,Florida,,ALCO,23.147672653198242,22.654953002929688,22.980146408081055,22.645103454589844,-2.128592613393801,1.4354185820174243,-0.7237282452844819,-2.17114353627668

The S.B.A. provides low-interest loans to homeowners, renters, business owners and nonprofits through its disaster relief programs. Homeowners can get loans of up to $500,000 to repair or replace damaged or destroyed real estate. Homeowners and renters are also eligible for up to $100,000 to repair or replace personal property. Businesses can get loans of up to $2 million.

The lack of funding has alarmed some lawmakers and disaster relief experts.

“This is a really, really important engine of recovery, and it could be quite devastating, even if there is a short-term delay and a backlog of applications,” said Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. “Given the scope and scale of what’s going on, I don’t think we have time to wait.”

On Tuesday, Representative Jared Moskowitz, Democrat of Florida, introduced a bill that would provide the S.B.A. billions more in funding to carry out relief efforts in response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton. “Congress should have proactively funded the S.B.A. and FEMA before going on a monthslong recess during hurricane season,” he said in a statement.",sba provides lowinterest loans homeowners renters business owners nonprofits lack funding alarmed lawmakers disaster relief experts,Florida,,ALCO,25.43800163269043,25.20882797241211,25.16897201538086,26.265010833740234,-0.900910628073114,-0.1581031735186869,-1.05758943329825,3.251077710392995

Now, the country is set to see another weather phenomenon as a plume of dust from the Sahara drifts across the Atlantic Ocean, creating hazy sunsets and possibly respiratory issues.

How does dust from the Sahara make its way across an ocean and into U.S. cities? Blame the wind.

“It’s pretty much just carried by brisk upper-level winds that bring you dust particles, all the way across the Atlantic,” said Sammy Hadi, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.

The occurrence is common during this time of the year in and around the Gulf of Mexico, where it creates hazy or gray skies and even orange sunsets, Mr. Hadi said.

“Usually July is pretty much the premiere period for Sahara transport,” he said.

These spells of Saharan dust typically peak from late June through August, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The base of the dust plume starts about a mile above the ground, and the plume can extend up to 2.5 miles into the atmosphere, according to scientists at the agency who track the movement of Saharan dust at the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory.",plume dust sahara drifts across atlantic ocean creating hazy sunsets occurrence common time year around gulf mexico,the United States,,TRV,141.92919921875,142.6326904296875,141.61451721191406,139.85577392578125,0.49566348208111577,-0.7138428187157825,-0.22171759480649947,-1.4608870509957994

At least 17 of the sites were animal feeding operations, according to an email from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality on Thursday. At least three had taken on enough water from Tropical Storm Debby to raise the waste within the lagoons to higher levels than permitted, although they were not overflowing.

Most of these animal operations are large-scale hog lagoons that mix the urine, feces and other waste from swine with water and anaerobic bacteria. The resulting slurry is stored in open-air pits that turn bright pink as the bacteria digest the sludge to reduce the odor.

The pollution enters waterways when open pits overflow or when the earthen walls of a pit fail. Hog waste that has been sprayed on nearby fields can flow downstream if the fields are oversaturated, although spraying is not allowed when it’s raining.

As temperatures soared, parts of Western Europe slogged through long-running drought conditions, while places from Vermont to Brazil to the Himalayas were inundated with floods or landslides. And then there were the wildfires in Maui, Texas and Canada, as well as in France, Portugal, the Canary Islands — and Greece.

It was a summer of extremes, and a summer of lessons for the travelers and locals who encountered them. Looking ahead, here are some lessons from the climate change upheavals of the past few months. One thing is clear: Unpredictability is the new normal.

1. Look for new ways to keep cool in cities

The world’s cities were on the front lines this summer, and many are trying to get out in front of the weather. In Athens, where temperatures spiked to 104 degrees in July, authorities closed the Acropolis in the middle of the day; they also installed shades to offer protection from the sun. In August, authorities at the Colosseum in Rome began offering early-morning tickets, allowing visitors accompanied by an official tour guide to enter as early as 7:30 a.m. And in Paris, Berlin and Washington, D.C., some pools and parks were kept open until as late as midnight during heat waves.

The organizers of next summer’s Olympic Games in Paris are planning ahead to beat the heat. The nearly 40-year-old Bercy Arena, site of the gymnastics competitions, is getting air conditioning — which is relatively uncommon in Paris and many other European cities — while the glass-roofed Grand Palais will be equipped with temporary air conditioning, as well as a huge shade.

Yet Biden administration officials lashed out at court challenges from the right and left that they said could undermine efforts to deal with record levels of border crossings in the days and weeks ahead.

Migrants continued to seek refuge in the United States in numerous pockets across the 2,000-mile border with Mexico, though U.S. Border Patrol officials and shelter operators said the flow of desperate people was lighter than they had feared it could be, given how many people had traveled north from their homes in recent weeks.

Even as they expressed relief at the lower-than-expected surge on Friday, administration officials seethed about court rulings that they predicted would hamper their ability to deal with the latest increase in arrivals and lead to dangerous overcrowding at already jammed border facilities.

Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the secretary of the Homeland Security Department, criticized a late Thursday ruling by a federal judge in Florida that blocked the department from releasing migrants without a notice to appear in immigration court, something he said had been done routinely by prior administrations to speed up the process and relieve overcrowding.

tornado,‘Don’t Lose Your Accent!’,2023-02-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/21/opinion/english-immigrants-language.html,"America, Manhattan","Of course, American English hasn’t just borrowed heavily from those coming from distant shores. Words like “kayak,” “chipmunk,” “tobacco” and “hurricane” are derived from some of the roughly 300 Native American languages spoken by those who were here long before most of our ancestors arrived. More than half of America’s states owe their names to Native American origin. I think of the poet Natalie Diaz, who wrote:

Manhattan is a Lenape word.

Even a watch must be wound.

How can a century or a heart turn

if nobody asks, Where have all

the natives gone?

Our nation’s founders would likely understand little of what we say today, given the amount of fresh acquisitions we’re always making. John Adams, our second president, was convinced that American English required a federally funded version of L’Académie Française in order to safeguard the people’s tongue from “going to the dogs.” He proposed in 1780 a strategy to build one. But Thomas Jefferson, who sought to protect Native American languages and is credited with introducing words like “belittle” and “pedicure"" into our lexicon, disagreed. He believed that a language has its own survival mechanisms.

Adams, fortunately, was on the losing side. American English is of, for and by the people, and its well-being depends on us. We do with it as we wish — or as we feel, since language is so often shaped by gut emotions. There are authorities within each language, of course, chief among them parents, educators, language scholars and dictionaries.

When our foundational dictionary, Noah Webster’s “An American Dictionary of the English Language,” first published in 1828, it included only 70,000 words. To be accepted into it, words must meet a specific criterion. Over time, it became Merriam-Webster, a commercial lexicon that now contains over 15 million examples of words. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive, as dictionaries in other languages might be. That is, Merriam-Webster doesn’t tell us how to speak. It’s the other way around: Native speakers and immigrants alike dictate what the dictionary should contain.

A Mexican immigrant, I am constantly amazed by how, in its 450-year history, American English has become stunningly elastic. It has recalibrated itself by learning from the past. It is essential that it continue to do so. Don’t give up your accent! Don’t lose your immigrant verbal heritage! As an immigrant, I find joy in hearing accents, particularly those by people who have mastered American English yet retain a beautiful trace of their native tongue.

It’s important to note that speaking English hasn’t always been a choice for some. Immigrants are sometimes made to feel that they have to suppress their language in order to belong. Throughout history, children have been physically disciplined or discriminated against for speaking their native language.",american english borrowed heavily coming distant shores half americas states owe names native american origin american english people wellbeing depends,America,,TRV,-3.0,177.13720703125,177.96910095214844,175.98977661132812,-3.0,0.4696325152917633,-3.0,-3.0

But it still isn’t very good. For most Americans, particularly those earning less than the median income, employers continue to control when, where and how they work, in some cases right down to their bathroom breaks.

“When we are workers, we lie under the government of a boss. It’s a dictatorship. The boss rules,” Elizabeth Anderson, a professor of philosophy and women’s studies at the University of Michigan, told me last week. She wrote a 2017 book on the topic, “Private Government: How Employers Rule Our Lives (And Why We Don’t Talk About It).”

Despite the obvious dominance of employers, though, a lot of economic research and legal scholarship is based on the libertarian notion that employers and employees have relatively equal bargaining power and are thus “free to contract” with one another as truly independent parties.

The assumption of roughly equal power is not just silly, it’s harmful. Take the Supreme Court’s 2018 decision in Epic Systems Corporation v. Lewis, which upheld the validity of contracts in which employees surrender the right to collective litigation against their employers. Underlying the decision, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, was the implicit assumption that when workers give up that important right, it’s their free choice.",10 million jobs united states unfilled august good gets workers leverage americans particularly earning less median income employers continue control,the United States,,TRV,155.3762664794922,156.80345153808594,158.67787170410156,167.545654296875,0.9185347871530439,1.1953947107856537,2.1249096142010515,7.832205067811322

Animal advocates had also pushed to delay the explosion, saying that there were pets left inside. But officials said there had been an elaborate search — with emergency workers going room to room, peeking in closets and under beds, and even using thermal technology — that did not turn up any.

One day in the mid ’90s, in Richmond, Va., where I grew up, the temperature had climbed above 100 degrees as it often did during the height of summer. Everything seemed to be melting under the oppressive heat that day. My grandmother looked down and began to vigorously massage her knees, like a soothsayer rubs a crystal ball. Staring at me, she said, “It’s gon’ storm.”

She was right.

I later learned that my grandmother was not psychic. She was instead using the pain in her joints to predict rain, a phenomenon that has been widely studied, with inconclusive results. Before humans became reliant on technology, we used our senses — including observing animal behavior and shapes of clouds — to help predict the weather.

Over time, those observations were stitched together, forming a history, said Mark Wysocki, a state climatologist for New York and professor of meteorology at Cornell University. “People started to either pass these on verbally or, as civilization started to evolve more, people would start writing these things down,” he said.

In 1989, the Appellate Division of New York’s Supreme Court ruled on a couple’s peculiar divorce case. A divorce, it turned out, wasn’t necessary — because they had never been legally married.

New York law stipulated that only ordained members of the clergy and certain government officials could solemnize a marriage. The couple were wed in 1986 by an officiant ordained by the Universal Life Church, a nondenominational religious group that offered fast certificates of ministry. But the Universal Life Church wasn’t an “ecclesiastical body,” the court ruled. It said the pair’s marriage — along with a contested prenuptial agreement — was thus null and void.

“The last thing you want to find out when you’re getting divorced is that you were never married,” said Bob Woletz, who at the time edited The New York Times’s Society News pages. (Those pages later became the Weddings section.)

The 1989 case set a precedent: Marriages performed by nontraditional ministers of organizations like the Universal Life Church were not recognized by the state. The case also created a problem for Mr. Woletz and his colleagues: Some couples writing to The Times in hopes of being announced in the wedding columns didn’t know that their impending unions might not be legitimate, in the eyes of New York.

Some hotels in the tropics are connecting the consumer with the nature around them — often, even food will be sourced locally.

Nature positive tourism is also about connecting people within communities that can safeguard nature. For example, in Colombia, they had a terrible problem with the drug trade, and they tried to pivot their economy to a peaceful economy based on tourism. You actually had former FARC guerrillas become guides. And in South Africa, where the poaching of rhinos has been a really big problem, many organizations, including government agencies, private conservancies and safari lodges, have incentivized people so that local communities actually can earn more by protecting their rhinos. You’re seeing this happen also in Rwanda, where the government is working with local communities to take back land that had been converted to agriculture to rebuild some of the forests that the gorillas live in.

What does it mean to invest in nature, which the report recommends?

There is now a lot of green investment where people are planting things like mangroves and restoring reefs that were destroyed by development. So, it’s not just about protecting, it’s also about rebuilding. I was just at a resort in Bali that is using 3-D printers to print coral and plug it back into places to start rebuilding the reef and protecting the fish stock.

The report recommends supporting sustainable value chains. What is that?

If you are a hotel, you look at where your energy is coming from, and how to buy energy that’s been sourced in a more sustainable way. Another concern: Where are you buying your food from? Is it imported?

A hotel doesn’t exist in isolation. It is supplied by a lot of people, and when they source things, the vehicles they use should be green. The goal is to try to spread that sustainability footprint through your whole supply chain, from transportation to food, energy and water.",report recommends reconecting people nature hotels tropics connecting consumer nature around often even food sourced locally,South Africa,,AMS.JO,144944.03125,145064.9375,149502.546875,145386.71875,0.08341581847648522,3.059050278776014,3.145017829080147,0.305419613475805

Some scientists have developed new metrics to try to capture a hurricane’s rain risk. But Mr. Schreck, who recently developed one such measure, said the National Hurricane Center understandably does not want to confuse the public with multiple rating scales.

Experts still hope to grow public awareness beyond the category rating. “We need to rethink how we name, categorize and talk about these things because too many people are dying,” said Kathie Dello, the state climatologist of North Carolina.

When it comes to big storms, “I never think about the category,” she said.

Hurricane Florence — one of the wettest and most destructive hurricanes to hit North Carolina — made landfall as a Category 1. And Fred, a storm that caused record-breaking flooding in western North Carolina in 2021, was a tropical storm, not a hurricane.

Even “downgraded” to a tropical storm, Helene was still deadly: Its unusually large size meant that it took longer for the storm to pass overhead, and so it rained longer.

The form grew out of a 2018 experiment that envisioned an entire breaking news feed of burstlike articles. While the feed never got off the ground, the idea for the article format persisted.

What’s Up? (Dec. 12-18)

Central Banks Act on Inflation

The Federal Reserve signaled on Wednesday that it would take more serious measures to address rapidly rising inflation. The central bank said it would speed up its plans to ease pandemic support measures, by ending its bond-buying program in March. In a new set of economic projections, Fed officials said they expected to raise interest rates three times next year. The Fed is one of several central banks to announce they would tweak their monetary policy in response to high inflation this week: The European Central Bank announced on Thursday that it would also end its pandemic-era bond-buying program in March, and the Bank of England voted to raise its interest rate.

Omicron Leads to Added Precautions

As the United States passed 800,000 deaths from Covid-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Tuesday that a significant surge in cases driven by the Omicron variant could arrive as soon as next month. Already, the average number of cases per day has risen by 40 percent from two weeks ago, according to a New York Times database. In response to the new threat, companies announced additional precautions last week and pulled back on plans to return to prepandemic working conditions. Conferences scheduled to take place in person moved to virtual platforms, and holiday parties were canceled. Google set deadlines for complying with its vaccine mandate. Apple delayed its return-to-office date to “indefinite.” The National Football League, The Metropolitan Opera and The Washington Post set new rules requiring all or some employees to receive booster shots. The good news? New studies suggest that vaccines, especially boosters, offer substantial protection against the Omicron variant.

Officials Examine Amazon’s Warehouse Collapse

Federal and state regulators said they would investigate the collapse of an Amazon delivery station in Illinois that a tornado struck this month, killing six people. The investigations will focus on the building’s construction and Amazon’s adherence to safety regulations. But the incident also highlighted an aspect of Amazon’s labor model. Only seven people who worked at the facility were full-time Amazon employees, a county commissioner told The Times. The other 102 people who worked at the facility across all of its shifts were employed by contractors for Amazon. This system allows Amazon to more easily shrink and expand its work force as needed, as well as avoid some of the liability and risks of hiring employees directly. In this case, it may have also complicated rescue plans: The police chief in Edwardsville, Ill., said that the model made it challenging to know how many workers were in the building when it collapsed.

Since the casual killing of George Floyd on camera, unprecedented protests — not policy papers — have radically shifted public opinion in support of the battle against systemic racism. The new nation being born in our streets may yet blossom into Langston Hughes’s “land that never has been yet / and yet must be” — but only if this movement refuses to let its truths be marched into the narrow cul-de-sac of “police reform.”

Yes, years of police killings of unarmed African-Americans had stacked up like dry tinder. True, George Floyd’s public murder furnished the spark. But freedom’s forge must finish its work while the coals are hot. This is the hour to reimagine what America could become if “We the People” meant all of us. America needs what this movement intends to do: change history, after which police training manuals will follow.

tornado,The Killer Climate Disaster That Has No Name,2024-09-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/opinion/heat-wave-names.html,"America, Chicago","Naming an extreme weather system also helps us recognize it as an enemy and mobilize support for public projects to combat future storms. After Sandy, for instance, citizens and officials concerned about climate change used stories from the storm to help persuade lawmakers to invest billions in new infrastructure, including renewable energy projects and flood management systems that double as social infrastructure. Heat waves rarely inspire that kind of policy action, because we can barely distinguish one from another, even when we’ve lived through them.

Naming hurricanes but not heat waves leaves no doubt about which threat our government, culture and society take more seriously. Compared with hurricanes, heat waves already face an uphill battle for attention, in part because the people they affect most are not property owners in expensive coastal areas, but America’s most disadvantaged: the old, the isolated, the poor and racially segregated residents of impoverished urban neighborhoods.

Heat is a silent and invisible killer. It usually fails to generate the kind of spectacular imagery that lands weather on prime-time television or a newspaper’s front page. We’ve all seen round-the-clock coverage of an approaching hurricane, animated by color-coded satellite maps, live reports from a gusty coast and stern warnings about imminent danger. Heat waves don’t receive anywhere near that level of attention. Instead of conveying drama and danger, most heat stories read like dry public service announcements.

What’s more, heat doesn’t produce enough property damage to induce federal emergency declarations from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose policies have historically leaned more toward protecting property and sustaining the economy than saving lives. Environmental, labor and health care groups have petitioned FEMA to start classifying extreme heat as a major disaster, but so far to no avail. As a result, state and local governments aren’t entitled to relief funds that could help them prepare for and cope with heat waves by, for example, shoring up their social infrastructure, so that residents can access libraries, swimming pools and senior centers during power outages, or improving the resilience of the electrical grid.

When a hurricane is coming, governors are expected to remain in their state to lead the response. But during the great Chicago heat wave of 1995, for instance, when an estimated 739 people died in just one blistering week, Chicago’s mayor and health commissioner went on vacation to escape the stifling conditions. The same thing happened across Europe in 2003, when officials from several nations were on vacation during a terribly lethal heat wave. Had those heat waves had a name, and been publicly recognized as a crisis, leaders might’ve been pressured to remain on hand to manage the response — and perhaps even save lives.",naming hurricanes helps mobilize support public projects combat future storms compared hurricanes heat waves face uphill battle attention heat doesnt produce enough property damage induce emergency declarations,America,,TRV,231.51876831054688,238.0754852294922,236.88534545898438,229.39744567871094,2.8320455256355217,-0.49990017634977435,2.3179879487087893,-0.916263786005681

The three judges on the panel seemed unconvinced, suggesting that they are unlikely to rule in the former president’s favor.

“All three judges who heard Trump’s appeal seemed pretty skeptical,” my colleague, Alan Feuer, told me.

The panel appeared particularly wary when Trump’s lawyer said during the hearing that a president could assassinate a political rival and still be shielded from prosecution unless the Senate first convicted him at an impeachment proceeding. However, the judges looked torn at times about how broadly they might rule; one suggested that a decision to deny immunity could result in a flood of partisan prosecutions of former presidents.

The appeals court is expected to make its ruling fairly quickly. Regardless of the decision, the issue of immunity is likely to reach the Supreme Court, where the justices will determine not only whether the case goes to trial, but when.

Older buildings not made of concrete were obliterated by Hurricane Ian. With properties that were worth nearly $4.5 billion, collectively, a little more than a month ago, the town almost certainly will rebuild. Federal and state aid and private capital undoubtedly will flow into the region over the next few years in copious amounts.

But how will Fort Myers Beach rebuild? And will this be the last time it does so? The pattern around the country has been to build back bigger, though not necessarily smarter. As an analysis in the journal Nature Sustainability put it a few years ago, “Exposure of residential assets to hurricane damage is increasing — even in places where hurricanes have struck before.”

This propensity to rebuild in ways we know are not safe must change. What if Fort Myers Beach had prepared not just for today’s climate threats — preparation that clearly was inadequate for a hurricane like Ian — but also for threats decades ahead, when seas will be higher, rainfall more torrential and storms rapidly intensifying in unpredictable ways?

The accumulating wear and tear on the components that hold the grid together, combined with weather that has often been hotter and stormier in some regions, means the wildfires and sustained blackouts may be a preview of how an aging grid could falter spectacularly as weather becomes more extreme and demand for electricity continues to rise.

The National Academy of Engineering calls the power grid the most important innovation of the 20th century, and with the greater electrification of society it will become even more critical. The sprawling system of transmission lines, power plants and transformers connects communities across the United States. Many of the components that tie the system together — utility poles, transmission towers and power lines — haven’t been modernized or upgraded since they were built, often decades ago. The consequences of this neglect, as we have seen, can be catastrophic.

This past spring, a decayed utility pole broke in high winds in the Texas Panhandle, causing power wires to fall on dry grass and igniting the largest fire in the state’s history. Two people died and more than one million acres burned. The Maui wildfire that killed more than 100 people and destroyed the historic town of Lahaina last year began after winds knocked down power lines, also igniting dry grass. The 2018 Paradise fire in California started when a live wire broke free of a tower that was a quarter-century past what the utility Pacific Gas & Electric considered its “useful life.” Eighty-five people died and nearly 14,000 homes were destroyed.",national academy engineering calls power grid important innovation 20th century sprawling system transmission lines power plants transformers connects communities across united states many components tie system together,Hawaii,,HE,13.369999885559082,12.220000267028809,12.0,11.640000343322754,-8.601343518128122,-1.80032947808028,-10.246820473340595,-12.939413291281312

Nothing like it had ever happened before — these wildfires began far earlier and spread far faster than usual, and they have burned far more boreal forest than any fire in Canada’s modern history.

As of this writing, 5,881 wildfires have consumed 15.3 million hectares, about 59,000 square miles, dwarfing the 10-year average of 2.6 million hectares per summer. That’s like all New York State incinerated, and the fires are burning still. One environmentalist told me that “unprecedented” has been used so often that it has lost any meaning against the uniqueness and horror of what is happening.

With the melting Arctic to their north and the immensity of their northern wilderness, Canadians are not strangers to climate anxiety. But as The Globe and Mail reported, “Canada’s summer of fire and smoke” has still come as a profound shock to the nation, “materially and psychologically, as people across the country report a sense of dread about the disaster unfolding just out of sight, and what it portends for the future.”

And as the summer unfolded, it became evident that it’s not just smoke, and not just Canada. This has been the summer from climate hell all across Earth, when it ceased being possible to escape or deny what we have done to our planet and ourselves. “Even I am surprised by this year,” said Michael Flannigan, a professor at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, British Columbia, who has been studying the interaction of fire and climate for over 35 years. “Temperatures are rising at the rate we thought they would, but the effects are more severe, more frequent, more critical. It’s crazy and getting crazier.”

The planet had its hottest week ever in July and is entering “uncharted territory,” the World Meteorological Organization declared. Maui, the loveliest of Hawaii islands, was savaged by a wildfire that killed more than 100 people and destroyed the picturesque town of Lahaina. Floods battered New England; a reading of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit (the ideal temperature for a hot tub) was recorded in the waters of Manatee Bay in South Florida.

The judge, William Alsup, ruled that the government’s human resources arm had unlawfully fired probationary workers en masse based on poor performance, regardless of their actual conduct on the job. He directed the Treasury and the Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy and Interior Departments to reinstate any employees who had been terminated in such a manner. “It was a sham,” Alsup said.

The reprieve for fired workers may be only temporary. Alsup clarified that agencies can still legally conduct large-scale layoffs, which are known as a “reduction in force.” The Office of Personnel Management had set a deadline of today for agencies to submit reduction in force plans.",judge ruled governments human resources arm unlawfully fired probationary workers en masse based poor performance sham judge said,California,,PCG,16.19614601135254,16.375883102416992,16.755325317382812,16.85517692565918,1.1097522270944462,2.317079406299723,3.4525454737091272,4.069060095189923

Every summer and fall, wildfires in America wreck homes, air quality and lives. While many of the current fires in Canada were caused by lightning that landed on dry forests, here in the States, lightning is rarely the culprit. An astonishing 80 percent are caused by human carelessness. That means they could have been prevented with smarter behavior in our increasingly flammable wild lands. With so much smoke polluting the air so early in the fire season, maybe we can finally stop thinking of wildfires as out of our control.

In the American West, evidence of fire foolishness is all around us. Nearly two years ago, the Caldor fire was allegedly started by a father and son who appear to have gone out shooting in a dry forest during California’s peak fire season, while smoke from the massive Dixie fire still hung heavy in the air. The Caldor fire scorched nearly 222,000 acres, destroyed 1,005 structures, injured multiple people and sent my husband and me packing ahead of the evacuation order.

When I drive past the moonscaped mountains and blackened tree skeletons where lush green forest used to be before the fire, I still get sad, then mad.

tornado,Wildfire Terms Defined: What It Means When a Blaze Is 30 Percent Contained,2021-08-17,https://www.nytimes.com/article/wildfire-firefighter-terms.html,the United States,"Many areas of the United States, especially the West, are in the cross hairs of devastating wildfires again this year.

In news conferences and alerts to residents, firefighters might rattle off figures on how many thousands of acres have burned and speak of how “red flag conditions” are fueling “extreme fire behavior” that is hampering their efforts to increase the percentage of a “complex fire” that is “contained.”

Here is a guide to help you understand some of the terms officials use when discussing wildfires:

Percent contained

When fire officials report that a fire is, say, 30 percent contained, that means that 30 percent of the blaze’s boundary is hemmed in by barriers like rivers, streams, interstate highways or areas that are already scorched, leaving no more vegetation to ignite. Other times, these containment lines are 10- to 12-foot-wide trenches that crews have dug along the fire’s edge — sometimes with bulldozers — to stop the fire from spreading.

When officials say a fire is 100 percent contained, that does not mean it has been extinguished. It means only that firefighters have it fully surrounded by a perimeter; it could still burn for weeks or months. Once a fire is declared “controlled,” then it’s over.",fire declared contained doesnt mean fully contained means contained perimeter water barriers,the United States,,TRV,146.0113067626953,147.0850830078125,146.91845703125,150.49143981933594,0.7354062290959021,-0.11328543531069672,0.6212876856372721,3.0683466616198123

However, Katrina pushed a deadly storm surge that reached 28 feet in some places; when this met a poorly built flood protection system around New Orleans, most of the city was flooded and more than 1,800 people were killed.

Laura is expected to make landfall late Wednesday night or early Thursday, most likely in the marshy plains near the Texas-Louisiana state line. The cities of Lake Charles, Port Arthur and Beaumont are all gravely threatened by the storm, and all are under mandatory evacuation orders.

“This is a very serious storm,” Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said during a briefing on Wednesday, pleading with residents again to heed official warnings.

“In the five years I’ve been governor, I don’t believe I’ve had a press conference where it was my intention to convey the sense of urgency that I am trying to convey right now,” Mr. Edwards said. “Our state hasn’t seen a storm surge like this in many many decades.”

City and county officials in Texas and Louisiana have issued evacuation orders affecting more than 500,000 residents, particularly those living in low-lying areas.

tornado,There’s No Escape From Wildfire Smoke,2023-05-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/17/opinion/wildfires-smoke-pollution-distance.html,"the United States, California, Alberta","In Western Canada, fire season comes early by American standards — beginning, usually, right around now. In Alberta, by today’s date, only about 1,000 acres have burned in recent years. This season so far, the total is already more than 1.5 million — which would make it the province’s third-worst annual result, just a few weeks into May, with months more of wildfire season still to burn.

In the United States, by contrast, those who live in fear of wildfire are probably breathing a bit easier. Last year was a relatively light one, with fewer than eight million acres burning across the country — close to the two-decade average and well below the damage of several especially scarring recent seasons. This year looks potentially even milder, thanks to the onslaught of “atmospheric rivers” along the West Coast, which many Californians experienced as extreme weather whiplash but which also supercharged the state’s depleted snowpack, turned millions of drought-browned acres a verdant green and at least for a time managed to substitute the fear of flooding, in California’s quasi-apocalyptic ecological imagination, for fear of fire. For now there may be out-of-control blazes burning in Alberta, 2,000 miles away, but to most on the American side of the border, they are out of sight and out of mind.

But a new lesson from the evolving science of wildfire is about how far its toxic smoke spreads and how widely its noxious impacts are distributed. You may think of fire in terms of scorched homes and go bags sitting ready for sudden evacuation. But distance is no cordon sanitaire for smoke. In fact, according to one not-yet-published study led by Stanford researchers exploring the distribution of wildfire smoke, an estimated 60 percent of the smoke impact of American wildfire is experienced by those living outside the states where the trees are in flames. Eighty-seven percent of the impact is experienced by those living outside the county of the original fire. And the problem is getting much worse.

In recent years, a new generation of California fires have taught us their own new vocabulary: “gigafires,” for fires burning a million or more acres; “fire tornadoes,” for blazes burning intensely enough to create their own dramatic weather systems; the “pyrocene age,” for the current global era defined by fires. Perhaps more memorably, we are now haunted by a new visual vocabulary, too: a town called Paradise incinerated in hours, amber urban skyscapes and whole cities navigating darkness at noon, dashcam evacuations through walls of flame.",western canada fire season comes early american standards alberta todays date 1000 acres burned recent years season far total already 1,the United States,,TRV,174.4737548828125,174.6371612548828,176.23281860351562,166.93765258789062,0.09365670623645743,0.9136986292991511,1.0082110755767377,-4.31933289908479

tornado,‘Stillwater’ Review: Another American Tragedy,2021-07-29,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/movies/stillwater-review.html,"the United States, Oklahoma, Hollywood, Italy","A truism about American movies is that when they want to say something about the United States — something grand or profound or meaningful — they typically pull their punches. There are different reasons for this timidity, the most obvious being a fear of the audience’s tricky sensitivities. And so ostensibly political stories rarely take partisan stands, and movies like the ponderously earnest “Stillwater” sink under the weight of their good intentions.

The latest from the director Tom McCarthy (“Spotlight”), “Stillwater” stars Matt Damon as Bill Baker. He’s a familiar narrative type with the usual late-capitalism woes, including the dead-end gigs, the family agonies, the wounded masculinity. He also has a touch of Hollywood-style exoticism: He’s from Oklahoma. A recovering addict, Bill now toggles between swinging a hammer and taking a knee for Jesus. Proud, hard, alone, with a cord of violence quaking below his impassivity, he lives in a small bleak house and lives a small bleak life. He doesn’t say much, but he’s got a real case of the white-man blues.

He also has a burden in the form of a daughter, Allison (a miscast Abigail Breslin), who’s serving time in a Marseille prison, having been convicted of savagely killing her girlfriend. The story, which McCarthy conceived of (he shares script credit with several others), takes its inspiration from that of Amanda Knox, an American studying in Italy, who was convicted of a 2007 murder, a case that became an international scandal. Knox’s conviction was later overturned and she moved back to the United States, immortalized by lurid headlines, books, documentaries and a risible 2015 potboiler with Kate Beckinsale.

Like that movie, which focuses on the sins of a vampiric, sensation-hungry media, “Stillwater” isn’t interested in the specifics of the Knox case but in its usefulness for moral instruction. Soon after it opens, and following a tour of Bill’s native habitat — with its industrial gothic backdrop and lonely junk-food dinners — he visits Allison, a trip he’s taken repeatedly. This time he stays. Allison thinks that she has a lead that will prove her innocence, which sends her father down an investigative rabbit hole and, for a time, quickens the movie’s pulse.",latest director tom mccarthy spotlight stilwater stars matt damon bill baker hes familiar narrative type usual latecapitalism woes including,the United States,,TRV,135.9032745361328,137.8101043701172,137.84710693359375,141.4571533203125,1.4030786531765305,0.02685039942875637,1.4303057848279643,4.08664088715763
tornado,California Is Re-examining Decades-Old Claims to Its Water,2023-12-20,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/20/us/california-water-rights.html,California,"I first got interested during last winter’s drenching storms. After three years of drought, billions of gallons of water were suddenly gushing down the rivers. Yet, irrigation districts that wanted to grab some were still finding it difficult. The reason, I learned, was the state’s water rights system: Even when there’s far too much to go around, the system sets limits.

At first, I imagined that this meant regulators had a big spreadsheet that recorded everybody’s allotments in an orderly way: Here’s your name, here’s your place in line, here’s how much you can take and when. I soon found out that this wasn’t exactly the case: Yes, everybody has allotments. But the way they’re spelled out and enforced can be the opposite of orderly.

What did you learn from your reporting?

One of the big issues is that California really has two water rights systems. The state water board began issuing permits and licenses in 1914. That’s one system. But a lot of major farms and irrigation districts staked their claims to water before 1914, and the board has much more limited authority to regulate those. So essentially, in the same river basin, with everybody sharing the same supplies, the state has jurisdiction over some users but not others.

For this reason and more, it is “shockingly difficult” for the water board to manage supplies by cutting people off during a drought, as Erik Ekdahl, the board official responsible for the cutting, puts it.

How has such a haphazard system persisted for so long in a state with so many water needs?

Most people in Nashville knew the Connecticut-born Mr. Einstein as the proprietor, with his wife, of Sweet 16th, the award-winning bakery they opened in 2004.

It’s worth dwelling on the significance of what could be a remarkable inflection point.

For centuries, the burning of coal, oil and gas has produced huge volumes of planet-warming gasses. As a result, global temperatures rose by an average of 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than at the dawn of the industrial age, and extreme weather is becoming more frequent.

But we now appear to be living through the precise moment when the emissions that are responsible for climate change are starting to fall, according to new data by BloombergNEF, a research firm. This projection is in roughly in line with other estimates, including a recent report from Climate Analytics.

Thanks to the rapid build-out of wind and solar power plants, particularly in China, global emissions from the power sector are set to decline this year. Last year, the amount of renewable energy capacity added globally jumped by almost 50 percent, according to the International Energy Agency.",global carbon dioxide emissions may peaked last year according new projection projection roughly line estimates including recent climate analytics report,China,,0700.HK,371.0,368.0,359.79998779296875,374.79998779296875,-0.8086253369272237,-2.2282641866932744,-3.018871214833221,1.0242554698028976

Gina Raimondo, the U.S. commerce secretary, told Chinese officials yesterday that the U.S. was not seeking to sever economic ties with China. But she raised a list of concerns that were prompting American businesses to describe China as “uninvestable” because it’s “too risky.”

American companies are worried about long-running issues like intellectual property theft, as well as newer developments like raids on businesses, a counterespionage law and exorbitant fines that come without explanations. After raising the concerns with Premier Li Qiang, China’s second-highest official, Raimondo said she “didn’t receive any commitments.”

Raimondo, who is on a four-day trip to China, also asked for Beijing’s cooperation on broader threats like climate change, the opioid fentanyl and artificial intelligence. Chinese officials in turn asked the U.S. to reduce export controls on advanced technology and retract a recent executive order that bans new investments in certain advanced technologies, Raimondo said. The commerce secretary said she had refused those requests, saying the U.S. doesn’t negotiate on matters of national security.

Still, Raimondo tried to assure the Chinese that export controls applied only to a small proportion of U.S.-China trade, and that other economic opportunities between the countries should be embraced.",us businesses say china uninvestable risky american companies worried longruning issues like intellectual property theft well newer developments like raids,China,,0700.HK,322.4149169921875,326.5789489746094,323.009765625,324.79437255859375,1.2915134390394147,-1.0929006173900295,0.18449786330044832,0.7380103838259776

For many people on the southern peninsula in Iceland, when the Fagradalsfjall volcano went off in 2021 after 781 years of dormancy, the answer was to take pictures. As the eruption continued over the course of six months, tourists and locals traveled closer to the volcano to take even more. Red bursts flying out of a black pyramid; the viscous creep of flame.

But this documentation only went so far. Some scientists wanted to know what was going on underneath the surface, miles deep, where light does not reach. There, the flowing rock works in ways that experts still cannot describe. So on the first day of the eruption, a helicopter flew out to the site and scooped up a bit of lava. Some samples were distributed to labs, which, after testing, sent back unexpected results: The lava was full of crystals.

Recently, with the help of similar samples gathered throughout the Fagradalsfjall eruption, steps have been taken toward characterizing the dynamics under the surface of the oceanic volcano. In a paper published in June in the journal Nature Communications, researchers who observed the chemical composition of the lava crystal samples collected over a six-month period found that they contained a wide range of material from different parts of the mantle, the amalgamate layer between the Earth’s crust and core.

And then there is explosive lava diversion. As far back as 1881, it was considered to stop a lava flow headed toward Hilo. It was never tried; the pile of gunpowder remained unused, and religious conviction was widely credited with stopping the burning river.

The incendiary concept nevertheless struck a chord. Lava often travels long distances in solid tubes or in channels of its own design. Some wondered, why not sever these dangerous volcanic arteries? Bombs delivered by land could work, but aerial bombing could be more accurate and speedier.

It remained nothing more than a concept until an eruption in 1935. That December, a pond of lava breached its levees and advanced on Hilo at a rate of a mile per day. Fearing it would reach the town and its watershed, Thomas Jaggar, the founder and first director of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, called on the Army Air Corps. On Dec. 27, 10 Keystone B-3 and B-4 biplane bombers struck the lava flow, targeting its tubes and channels.

Half these bombs were packed with 355 pounds of TNT. The other half were not explosive, and instead designed to emit smoke so the pilots could see where the bona fide bombs landed.

Hours of rain on Saturday night carried volcanic rock and ash down Mount Marapi, an active volcano on the island of Sumatra, and into homes in nearby towns. Those mudslides are known as lahars in Indonesian, which translates to cold lava. The rain also caused a nearby river to overflow.

A moving lahar looks like a “roiling slurry of wet concrete,” and a large one can crush, bury or carry away almost anything in its path, including buildings, bridges and roads, according to the United States Geological Survey.

Lahars, which can also be triggered by landslides and volcanic eruptions that melt snow and ice, can quickly grow in size and speed as they rush down volcanoes, according to the U.S. agency’s website.

“People in Reykjavik are waking up with an earthquake, others go to sleep with an earthquake,” said Thorvaldur Thordarson, a professor of volcanology at the University of Iceland. “There’s a lot of them, and that worries people, but there’s nothing to worry about, the world is not going to collapse.”

Earthquakes are common in Iceland because it straddles two of the Earth’s tectonic plates, the North American and Eurasian, which are divided by an undersea mountain chain, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

But a specific type of volcanic bomb rarely lives up to the second half of its name: These objects get blasted into the air, crash into the ground and disappointingly fail to detonate.

These volcanic bombs — plasticky, partly molten blisters of magma no smaller than a peach — are shot out of a volcano submerged by a shallow body of water, like a lake or the sea close to shore. In the process, the bombs acquire plenty of water. That trapped water encounters the bomb’s scorching-hot innards and gets vigorously boiled into steam.

The sudden accumulation of steam within the projectile should blast the bomb apart in midair. “Rocks cannot survive in the face of that pressure,” said Mark McGuinness, a mathematician at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. And yet so many of these bombs become duds, hitting the ground with an anticlimactic thud.

Solving this riddle would do more than scratch a longstanding scientific itch. Volcanic bombs, a fundamental part of many explosive eruptions, are also a lethal hazard.

The Kraffts fit neatly within his gallery of quixotic figures unintimidated by what, in “Grizzly Man,” he called “the overwhelming indifference of nature.” Herzog puts the Kraffts’ deaths — they were killed while observing the eruption of Mount Unzen in Japan in 1991 — up front, dwelling on video that shows them waiting at the volcano that would kill them and considering what they and other onlookers would have been thinking as the clock ticked down. He then runs down other narrow escapes that happened during their career. Over footage of an eruption in Alaska, Herzog, narrating as usual, marvels at how Maurice does not flee but instead calmly keeps the action in frame until he runs out of film.

Clearly Herzog sees the Kraffts as kindred spirits — fellow intrepid globe-trotting auteurs. (Near the end, he confesses that he would have given much if he “could have been their companion.”) And while “Fire of Love” was also concerned with the Kraffts’ evolution as filmmakers, and with the extent to which they played for the camera, Herzog’s perspective is more eccentric. As he contemplates how the Kraffts’ gaze became, in his estimation, less scientific and more humanistic, he is drawn to the material they shot of people and of animals, in clips that have no volcanoes at all. Nobody has ever filmed landscapes like them, he says. “Some of it has the quality of dreams.”

The smoking gun was ancient volcanism in what is today Siberia, where volcanoes disgorged enough magma and lava over about a million years to cover an amount of land equivalent to a third or even half of the surface area of the United States.

But volcanism on its own didn’t cause the extinction. The Great Dying was fueled, two separate teams of scientists report in two recent papers, by extensive oil and coal deposits that the Siberian magma blazed through, leading to combustion that released greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane.

“There was lots of oil, coal and carbonates formed before the extinction underground near the Siberian volcanism,” said Kunio Kaiho, a geochemist at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan, and the lead author of one of the studies, published this month in Geology, which presented evidence for the burning of ancient fossil fuels by magma. “We discovered two volcanic combustion events coinciding with the end-Permian land extinction and marine extinction.”",paleontologists call permiantriasic mass extinction another name great dying happened 252 million years ago 96 percent life oceans,Japan,,7203.T,1309.753662109375,1288.6258544921875,1285.456298828125,1285.456298828125,-1.6131130783143524,-0.24596399746391368,-1.8551093983672309,-1.8551093983672309

The film is a psychedelic tour of the islands, jumping from image to image and interweaving voice-overs or scenes with lectures on the cosmology, astronomy, history and science of Hawaii. Through some of its images and narration, it urges viewers to consider the ways in which science can be a colonizing force, further marginalizing native Hawaiians and their traditional modes of inquiry while helping to criminalize their dissent.

Twenty-pound globes of jackfruit, rock hard and encased in bright green, elephant-skin-like hide, dangle from branches.

Fantastic private gardens also cultivate many of these wild plants. Jungle Bay Resort in Soufriere claims to have 75 different tropical fruit trees in its garden, a number we doubted until its owner, Sam Raphael, marched us around for 45 minutes, ticking off and letting us taste dozens of species.

Situated a few hundred yards below Trafalgar Falls, a double waterfall, Papillote predates many of the other eco-friendly establishments on the island.

Bordy, a sedimentologist at the University of Cape Town, was flipping through an obscure dissertation from the 1960s when a clue leapt out at her. It was an image of a footprint on a farm located on the northern Karoo Basin of South Africa.

The Karoo region contains huge volcanic flood basalts that chronicle the final epoch of the ancient supercontinent Gondwana before it broke apart about 180 million years ago during a period of tectonic and volcanic catastrophe. Geologists have been studying it for decades to understand this major change in the layout of Earth’s landmasses, which coincided with a mass extinction event.

But the image suggested to Dr. Bordy that there was more to learn about the prehistoric animals that had lived on that dying supercontinent. That initial hunch sparked something like a paleontological detective tale.

First, Dr. Bordy and her colleagues were able to track down the farm’s owner with the help of a local historian. He gave her team permission to hunt for fossils on his property. There, the team not only found the pictured footprint, but also discovered two dozen other prints left 183 million years ago by carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs, as well as small creatures called synapsids.",sedimentologist university cape town flipping obscure dissertation 1960s clue leapt image footprint farm located northern karo basin south africa,South Africa,,AMS.JO,114205.296875,117444.2265625,121409.609375,119250.296875,2.8360590761784663,3.3763965488671785,6.308212225817569,4.417483372528556

In a statement on Feb. 27, the board gave the foundation until May to decide how to choose between two competing proposals for the telescope. The announcement came as a relief to American astronomers, who have been fretting about losing ground to their European colleagues in the quest to examine the heavens with bigger and better telescopes.

But which of the two telescopes will be built — and the fate of the dreaming and the billions of dollars’ worth of time and technology invested already — remains an open question. Many astronomers had hoped that the foundation, the traditional financier of national observatories, would find a way to invest in both projects.

The two projects are the Giant Magellan Telescope at Las Campanas in Chile and the Thirty Meter Telescope, possibly destined for Mauna Kea on the island of Hawaii, also known as the Big Island. Both would be larger and more powerful than any telescope currently on Earth or in space. Each is expected to cost some $3 billion or more, and less than half the projected cost has been raised so far by the international collaborations backing them.

In an announcement circulating among astronomers, the board said that funding even one telescope at the price point of $1.6 billion would take up most of the N.S.F.’s typical budget for construction.",us spend 16 billion new telescope national science board says board may decide two competing proposals would larger powerful telescope currently,Chile,,SQM,46.59101867675781,45.82445526123047,48.76128387451172,49.697086334228516,-1.6453029731881526,6.408867484707315,4.658119224245584,6.666666120825089

Jason Morgan, who in 1967 developed the theory of plate tectonics — a framework that revolutionized the study of earthquakes, volcanoes and the slow, steady shift of the continents across the earth’s mantle — died on July 31 at his home in Natick, Mass. He was 87.

His children, Jason and Michèle Morgan, confirmed the death.

The notion that the earth’s surface moved was not new when Professor Morgan, who taught at Princeton University, first presented his theory at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Washington in April 1967. People had long noticed, for example, that the northeastern edge of South America seemed to match the notch along Africa’s western coast, and wondered if they had once fit together like puzzle pieces.

By the mid-20th century, researchers had made significant steps forward in studying the movement of the earth’s surface, including the discovery that stretches of the sea floor were spreading apart. But the idea, called continental drift, remained highly debated into the 1960s, and no one had come up with a way to synthesize it all into a grand, testable framework.

Professor Morgan had initially planned to discuss underwater trenches at the Geophysical Union meeting. But after reading a paper about fracture zones — vast scars across the ocean floor that offer evidence of past distortions in the earth’s surface — he changed his mind.",w jason morgan 1967 developed theory plate tectonics died july 31 home natick mass 87,Washington,,WY,31.576494216918945,31.462158203125,31.56696891784668,31.185836791992188,-0.3620921721344326,0.3331326288711793,-0.03016579043522156,-1.237177953458305

Imagine if the opposite happened and wildfires typically raised surface temperatures. The extra heat could dry out forests and cause even more wildfires to break out. That would be a disastrous feedback loop.

“It’s reassuring that there’s not going to be a positive feedback” from forest fires to smoke to more forest fires, Michael Fromm, a meteorologist for the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, told me on Thursday.

That said, there’s still a lot that’s unknown about the effects of wildfires, which are becoming more common as the planet heats up. Fromm told me that wildfires haven’t yet been incorporated into the giant computer models that are used to forecast climate change.

Ms. Thompson hopes to pursue mechanical engineering on a pre-med track in college. Beyond the more profound outcomes of her team’s collaboration, she said, the Rube Goldberg club at her school was just plain fun. “I get to use power tools and hot glue for hours on end every weekend.”

In revisiting the cartoons of Mr. Goldberg that inspired the competition, it becomes difficult to ignore the wartime context that looms over them. Indeed, although Mr. Goldberg, who died in 1970, has become synonymous with mechanized tomfoolery, the cartoon that eventually earned him a Pulitzer Prize was pure political commentary. He won in 1948 for a single panel titled “Peace Today,” which featured a family perched on the top of an atomic bomb teetering perilously at the edge of a cliff labeled “World destruction.”

If Mr. Goldberg’s original drawings served as satire for a heavily industrialized society, their contemporary analogues nearly a century later might be seen as responses to the detritus of that society, which suffered the economic and social effects of emphasizing efficiency above the human spirit. Jan Hakon Erichsen, a performance artist based in Norway whose destructive chain-reaction contraptions receive millions of views on social media, has even begun to see himself as part of the joke.

Mr. Erichsen’s performances often feature the deft use of his body in the accomplishment of utterly nonsensical tasks: He engineers a suspended hacksaw to slice dried spaghetti off his head; swings his knife-covered legs over a row of balloons to pop them; creates a life vest out of loaves of bread, then jumps into a freezing lake.

Those farmers recently won a series of settlements — totaling more than $41 million — after a nearly five-year legal battle with distributors and retailers that were accused of using the Kona name in a misleading way.

The class-action lawsuit, aided by a novel chemical analysis of coffee from Hawaii and around the world, prompted some companies to include the percentage of authentic Kona beans on product labels. The plaintiffs said they hoped the hefty settlements — the last of which will likely be paid this spring — would deter others from selling fake Kona.

“There are probably many, many more marketers of coffee who have misused geographic names in marketing, and this will be a disincentive,” said Bruce Corker, who owns the Rancho Aloha coffee farm in the Kona district.",hundreds farmers kona region produce one expensive coffees world recently series settlements totaling 41 million nearly fiveyear legal battle,Hawaii,,HE,13.239999771118164,12.949999809265137,12.720000267028809,13.850000381469727,-2.190332076029453,-1.7760582673659493,-3.927488769476313,4.607255444839375

Twenty-four people remained missing, as search efforts continued.

Officials had put the number of deaths from the shallow 5.6-magnitude quake, which rattled a mountainous area and caused damage across a wide area of disparate villages separated by rugged, hilly roads, at 272 as of Thursday afternoon. Some local officials had said earlier figures given by the central government were an undercount, in part because some families had buried their dead soon after the quake, before responders reached their villages. Officials said they were working on cross-checking the data by gathering death certificates or recording the identities of victims from the cemeteries of all affected villages.

The earthquake in Cianjur, an agricultural region in West Java Province famed for its rice, destroyed tens of thousands of homes and set off massive landslides that swallowed whole communities. About a third of those killed were children who had been trapped in houses or schools that crumbled, in a rural area with lax building standards, officials said in the days after the quake.

The number of the dead and injured, as well as tens of thousands forced from their homes, was high even for Indonesia, where earthquakes and other natural disasters are virtually a daily occurrence.

Iceland, a country of less than 400,000 people, has more than 600 natural hot springs. The volcanic island gets the better part of its heat and energy from geothermal sources. But that warm water has also long been part of the island’s culture, turning bathing in public pools into a sociable national pastime. (It may even be the reason for residents’ happiness.)

The country also has about 130 volcanoes, most of which are active. Iceland is above a hot spot, a place with “abnormally high magma activity,” according to the country’s tourism website, which notes that other famous hot spots include Yellowstone National Park and Hawaii.

The mixed-race children of Hilaire, who is Black, and Eulalie, a descendant of poor white settlers, will each have their chance to speak: There are the sisters Antoine and Lucinde and their younger brother, “Petite-Frère.”

But it is Antoine’s telling that truly animates Bulle’s novel, faithfully translated by Julia Grawemeyer, which moves from late-1940s Morne-Galant to Pointe-à-Pitre, the country’s capital, and the banlieues of Paris. “She was the link from the past to present, from Guadeloupe to Paris, like an underground root, full of life,” thinks Antoine’s French-born niece, who is seeking to make sense of her own identity “between two worlds.”

But what will be left of their Caribbeanness when they emigrate to France?

Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times

Days before the first phase of Washington’s vaccination entry requirement went into effect on Jan. 15, The Big Board, a family-owned bar in the popular H Street Corridor, tweeted that it would “always” be open to everyone.

The Big Board’s owners kept their promise, at a high cost. This week, the bar, a mile from the U.S. Capitol, was shut down after refusing to abide by Mayor Muriel Bowser’s order to check that patrons over the age of 12 had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine.

But the bar already seems to have another life, at least in conservative circles.

After a city health inspector posted a closure notice on The Big Board’s door on Tuesday saying that the bar “presents an imminent health hazard to the public,” Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, dined at the bar with staffers, according to The Washington Examiner and The Daily Caller, two conservative news outlets. But since then, the bar has remained closed to the public.

Mr. Paul has introduced a bill before Congress to overturn Washington’s vaccination requirements. He also previously claimed that “masks don’t work,” despite the consensus among public health officials that they do limit the spread of the virus. A California study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week also showed that consistent use of high-quality masks offers strong protection to wearers.

The Examiner and The Daily Caller reported that several other Republican members of the House joined Mr. Paul on Tuesday night, all of whom have also publicly criticized vaccine mandates, including Representatives Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, and Ronny Jackson, Republican of Texas. Grinning and maskless, some of the lawmakers posed for pictures with a co-owner of the bar, Eric Flannery.

In a YouTube video made that evening, Mr. Flannery, with some of the congressional representatives standing next to him, vowed to “keep on fighting” and said the mayor’s order needed to be challenged in D.C. Superior Court.

Mr. Massie then saluted Mr. Flannery’s defiance. “If the mandate is illogical, the only logical thing to do is to defy it,” Mr. Massie said. “If the mandate is unconstitutional, it is constitutional not to follow it. If the mandate is unscientific, the only scientific thing to do is to ignore it. And so God bless you and thank you for being in the fight.”

And Representative Tim Burchett invited Mr. Flannery to relocate. “If you want to come to Tennessee, we’re a freedom-loving state, and we’d love to have you, brother,” he said.

The video was uploaded by the Daily Signal, a conservative site, and later shared by The Big Board on its Facebook page.

On Thursday, Glenn Beck, the unvaccinated conservative radio host who has previously been criticized for spreading misinformation about Covid vaccines, also interviewed Mr. Flannery and promoted the bar, directing listeners to a fund-raising campaign on GiveSendGo, a self-described Christian crowdfunding site. Another conservative talk radio show, The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, which took over the time slot previously filled by right-wing talk radio star Rush Limbaugh, interviewed Mr. Flannery on Thursday and linked to the crowdfunding site. By Saturday afternoon, that site had logged more than $16,500 in donations.

And an earlier GoFundMe campaign for The Big Board’s owners set up by a correspondent with the Daily Caller on Jan. 19 and tweeted by Mr. Paul had logged more than $32,700 in donations by Saturday afternoon.

Mr. Flannery and The Big Board did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In December, when Mayor Bowser announced that the vaccination entry requirement would be put into place, Washington was experiencing surging rates of positive Covid tests as the Omicron variant became dominant.

Its First Lady Has Some Advice for Them.,2023-06-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/01/travel/iceland-tourism-eliza-reid.html,Iceland,"You know, I started visiting 25 years ago, and in those days I would meet people who would say, “What, do you mean Ireland?” And now everybody says, “Oh, I’m going there,” or “My neighbor’s going,” or “I want to go.” It’s far more in people’s consciousness.

Right after the volcanic eruption in 2010, there was the launch of the “Inspired by Iceland” campaign to promote tourism. I read that over a quarter of the Icelandic adult population participated in that.

Well, everybody was supposed to tell all their friends to come to Iceland. I did that for sure, and a lot of other people did, too. There have been some genius campaigns, and a lot of them have important underlying messages about sustainability, like the Icelandic pledge, a commitment to responsible travel that anyone can take online. I think that travelers want to learn about the countries we’re visiting and what we can do to give back, but sometimes we don’t know how to access that information. And the Icelandic pledge is a good way of reminding people to be kind to nature and make sure you have a travel plan in case something happens.

I was struck by one item in the pledge that said, “I will take photos to die for, without dying for them.” I guess people forget themselves sometimes?

Here we have hot springs with really hot water; we have active volcanoes; we have sneaker waves on beaches; we have strong winds. We somehow think that we’re invincible when we’re on vacation, but we still have to use our common sense.

You write in your book that one of the best ways for visitors to get to know Icelanders is to hang out in a hot tub at a geothermal pool. Why is that?

They say if you want to meet a Brit, go to a pub; if you want to meet a French person, go to a cafe. And definitely here in Iceland, you go to a swimming pool, because that’s where you can meet people — morning, afternoon or evening. And I recommend that visitors try different pools, because they all have their own character and personality and you can meet different types of people. They’re clean and affordable, and it’s something that all the locals do.

In reading your book, I got the sense that the Icelandic community is increasingly diverse, but still very close-knit.

On the weekend, I had to buy a bra — which, you know, it’s such a fun experience. I was talking to the woman who worked at the store, and the woman in the changing room next to me says, “I know that voice.” And it was our chief medical officer — like the Anthony Fauci of Iceland. And we were just laughing that only in Iceland do we run into each other in an undergarment store. And then I ran into her again in the grocery store the next day.

They watched and debated for hours in order to select the most rank and vile footage possible. Many options were too weak, such as footage of “mildly moldy food,” Dr. Kupfer said. “We wanted feces, we wanted some sort of infection,” he clarified.

Dr. Kupfer’s dream came true. The final ectoparasite clips included a kitten riddled with fleas, a nightmarish bed bug infestation and a beauty shot of a mosquito sucking blood. The final pathogen clips included meat pulsing with maggots, an infected arm lesion oozing pus — Dr. Fessler called it the “pus volcano” — and a clump of earwax as dark as an asteroid.

The meat was Dr. Kupfer’s own creation; unable to find an adequately disgusting video of rotten food, he left a slab of meat in his garden for two weeks and returned when it “seemed maximally disgusting,” he said.

The video that the researchers found most disgusting — titled “Dirty festival toilets” in the paper’s supplementary information — has since been removed from YouTube. This, perhaps, is for the best. I tried to watch every video used in the experiment. I did not vomit, but I did experience heart palpitations and had to sit in my bathroom with the lights off for several minutes until I stopped seeing the pus volcano. Missing out on the dirty festival toilets, it seemed, was an act of self-care.

She was born in 1945 in Garden City, Kan., one of five siblings. Her father abandoned the family when she was a toddler. Her mother, an artist, remarried a mechanic, and the couple worked as migratory fruit pickers, drifting west until they eventually settled near Portland, Ore. As a teenager, too broke to buy drugs, Dunn later joked, she would sometimes try to catch bugs in order to get high. Dunn’s mother beat her; once, she threw a screwdriver that punctured Dunn’s calf, leaving a lifelong scar. When Dunn was 17, she left home for good. After a brief stint in jail for attempting to pass a bad check, she enrolled in Reed College. She fell in love, dropped out of Reed and traveled around the world before returning to Portland to raise her son, Eli. She cobbled together jobs, wrapping candy on assembly lines and posing nude for life-drawing classes. She also waited tables and bartended at dive bars where she dodged biker-gang fights. A patron once tried to slit her throat.

Dunn published her first two novels in quick succession. Her debut, “Attic” (1970), is a portrait of the artist, a young woman named Katherine who lands in jail for writing a bad check. “Attic”’s raunchy narrator delights in explicit descriptions of sex, drugs and bowel movements. Most of the novel is pretty stomach-churning stuff — lengthy paragraphs on the contents of prison latrines — so when kind moments arrive, they’re equally shocking. (There’s a tender fable about a dragon that supposedly poops sugary goodies, but when two kids try to eat the excrement, they discover that the dung in fact tastes like dung. They confront the dragon, but feel so sorry for it that they continue to snarf its feces, pretending they’re treats.) Her second novel, “Truck” (1971), also incorporates aspects of Dunn’s life, following a teenage runaway who hitchhikes from Portland to Los Angeles. Then her novel-writing career went dark for 18 years — until “Geek Love.”

Published in 1989, “Geek Love” catapulted Dunn to cult status. The book, a best seller and a National Book Award finalist, chronicles the adventures of the Binewskis, a family of circus sideshow performers. The mother and father hack their bodies with drugs and radioactive isotopes in order to birth progeny with unusual abilities: Arturo, a boy with flippers; Elly and Iphy, conjoined twins; Oly, a hunchback; and Chick, who seems so disappointingly normal that the parents almost abandon him at a laundromat before he reveals telekinetic powers. After “Geek Love,” Dunn never published another novel. She became a prolific writer on boxing, and she continued to live in Portland until she died, in 2016. But that’s not quite the whole story: Before “Geek Love” there was “Toad” (along with at least one other, unfinished novel).

Now, six years after Dunn’s death, “Toad” is appearing in print for the first time. It offers not the freakish yet relatable pyrotechnics of circus life, but the unglamorous musings of middle age. If “Geek Love” is, as the French say, jolie laide (ugly-pretty), then “Toad” is just ugly. Yet that doesn’t make it any less mesmerizing. The eponymous “toad” is Sally Gunnar, a hermit living alone in a dingy house in a small town, stretching out a titchy pension. She’s got about five teeth left at the beginning of the novel, and as in a classic nightmare, they seem to keep falling out, so by the end, there are only two anchoring her baby-soft gums.

Hollywood had imagined them, and now they were made real but not too real. The worst of the Northridge Earthquake was that it knocked the books from the shelves of our school library. We put them back.

A few years ago, during the pandemic lockdowns, I found a strange comfort in “9-1-1.” I had moved away from Los Angeles for college and then to New York City, where I have spent most of my adult life. So the imagined disasters of the show felt silly, remote. And as with “Emergency!,” the 1970s series that pioneered first-responders drama, “9-1-1” suggested that every calamity had a tidy resolution, that police officers, firefighters and emergency medical technicians could handle any cataclysm.

It has been strange to watch this real disaster unfold from almost 3,000 miles away. On Wednesday, I hustled to a media event with my phone held in front of my face, playing and replaying a Fox 11 video of my local library burning to the ground. Palisades Charter High School, my mother’s alma mater and the site of many Hollywood productions, was also aflame.

Later that same night, back at home, I learned that most of my former neighborhood in the Palisades is now gone. A beachside restaurant where I lazed as an adolescent, the gas station where we bought cigarettes — these had burned, too. For a while, on Thursday morning, the New York Times homepage led with a video of the ruins of Via de la Paz, where my family lived for over 20 years until the late 2000s. ‘Look at you,’ I thought bleakly, as I played the video of the street repeatedly. ‘You’re famous.’",northridge earthquake destroyed much los angeles historic palisades neighborhood citys library high school among buildings burned ground,Los Angeles,,TRV,231.4829559326172,232.37930297851562,235.96461486816406,239.002197265625,0.3872194573838762,1.5428705756897436,1.936064328144941,3.248291565447524

SUNDAY PUZZLE — In his print introduction to this grid, Joel Fagliano writes: “Zachary Schiff is a writer living in New York City. This is his first crossword for The Times. The theme was initially planned for a 15x15 weekday puzzle, but it didn’t quite pan out — through ‘trial and error and a little bit of luck,’ he was able to rework it into a Sunday. His favorite clue is 89-Down, a fact he heard a few years back and stored away in the hopes of one day including in a puzzle.”

The trick today is subtle, and I can’t imagine this theme playing nicely in a small grid — it deserves to sprawl out a bit; the extra space also allows for a fun hidden word surprise. My solve galloped along, and it never felt as if I was on too long a path.

By Kelly Yang

Moving — the abandonment of familiar rhythms for the dislocation of new people and places — is hard. Moving during a global health crisis is harder. And moving as a child, in the middle of a pandemic that is fueling racism and curtailing in-class education, is perhaps hardest of all.

In “New From Here,” Kelly Yang (of “Front Desk” fame) takes on the perspective of Knox Wei-Evans, a 10-year-old boy who is uprooted from his home in Hong Kong as the coronavirus spreads from China to the rest of the world. Knox, his siblings and his mother, a workaholic banker born in Beijing, shelter in California while his father, a white San Francisco native who always has time for a tickle session despite his job as a lawyer, stays in Hong Kong with their beloved labradoodle.

Knox has a habit of blurting things out. “It drives everyone in my family crazy,” he says, without knowing, just yet, that there is a clinical diagnosis for his candor. But at the dawn of 2020, as the United States seems far safer than an international city appended to the Chinese land mass, there is little to be forthright about, except raw emotion. The struggle for face masks and hand sanitizer, along with employment and refuge, induces a global anxiety that washes over the Wei-Evans family, most powerfully over a young boy with A.D.H.D.

As the story begins in Hong Kong, the angst Knox feels is that of a Mandarin speaker in a place where that dialect is associated with the Chinese government, which has dismantled the territory’s civil liberties. More than a million Hong Kong people gathered in peaceful rallies before the police cracked down. Some mainlanders, as those from the rest of China are called, fear reprisals from riled Cantonese-speaking crowds. Knox’s mother instructs her mixed-race children not to speak Mandarin in public and to emphasize their American and Hong Kong heritage.",kelly yang takes perspective knox weievans 10yearold boy uprooted home hong kong coronavirus spreads knox siblings mother work,China,,0700.HK,389.6454162597656,375.1313781738281,360.989501953125,356.5236511230469,-3.724934897286562,-3.7698462574757134,-7.354356835943513,-8.500488843076086

But they are at a loss to describe precisely why.

Spending even a short time with him, one can’t help but pick up bits of odor-related trivia. Who knew that most of the air we’re inhaling at any given moment passes through just one nostril or the other, not both? Or that Oriental lilies could be so divisive: His wife loves the smell, he finds it “ugly.”

Listen carefully, though, and he often addresses debates that transcend his day-to-day work, escaping the realm of science altogether and drifting toward the metaphysical: Is the human aversion to putrid smells nature, or nurture, or both? How can one measure a perception? And how do you give people the confidence in their noses that they have in their eyes and ears?

What the Nose Can Tell Us

A smell is, quite simply, a result of chemicals in the air, and the human nose is far better at detecting them than it often gets credit for. Some of the most recognizable and potent odors, like hydrogen sulfide (think rotten egg) can be sensed at even the tiniest concentrations, like 1 part per billion.

“If you were to map out the distance from New York to Los Angeles, 1 part per billion would account for only a few inches along that route,” Dr. Koziel of Iowa State said. (In fact, it would account for less than an inch.)",smell result chemicals air human nose far better detecting often gets credit recognizable potent odors like hydrogen sulfide sensed,Los Angeles,,TRV,152.56700134277344,152.6418914794922,152.79168701171875,152.22994995117188,0.04908671997196416,0.09813526992797249,0.14727016128507991,-0.22092024398140106

In “The OA,” a fable-like iteration of the resurrection theme, the heroine has perished many times over, blind in one incarnation but gifted in another with an extraordinary second sight. Death itself is illusory, she assures a young school friend. “I think you are always somewhere.”

There is “The Returned,” an American adaptation of “Les Revenants,” a decade-old series about the long-gone members of a French Alpine village intent on picking up the shards of their lives, unaware that their near and dear have long since moved on. And “Katla,” an Icelandic production in which the deceased resurface in the shadow of an active volcano, seeking to salve emotional wounds.

At a time when people are grieving not only their dead, but lost jobs, opportunities and daily routines, the appetite for such fare seems especially poignant. Reveries, sci-fi fantasies or meditations on life’s great mysteries, these shows offer viewers little in the way of resolution but hold out a promise of redemption, reunion and, not least, a chance to muse on their mortality.

One recent estimate suggested that, over all for 2020, emissions from human activity could drop nearly 8 percent, which would be the largest year-to-year decline ever recorded.

But even a drop of that magnitude is overshadowed by natural variability in carbon emissions from vegetation and soil in response to seasonal changes in temperature and soil moisture, Scripps scientists said in a news release announcing the readings. They estimated that human-caused emissions would have to drop by 20 percent to 30 percent for at least six months to result in a slowing of the rate of increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

“People may be surprised to hear that the response to the coronavirus outbreak hasn’t done more to influence CO2 levels,” said Ralph Keeling, a geochemist who runs the Scripps Oceanography CO2 program. The project, begun by his father, Charles D. Keeling, has been taking readings since 1958 at a NOAA observatory on Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii.

Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times

Hours after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a conservative radio show host that “we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians” behind the vast hack of the federal government and American industry, he was contradicted on Saturday by President Trump, who sought to muddy the intelligence findings by raising the possibility that China was responsible.

Defying the conclusions of experts inside and outside the government who say the attack was a cybersecurity breach on a scale Washington has never experienced, Mr. Trump also played down the severity of the hack, saying “everything is well under control,” insisting that the news media has exaggerated the damage and suggesting, with no evidence, that the real issue was whether the election results had been compromised.

“There could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election,” he wrote on Twitter in his latest iteration of that unfounded conspiracy theory. He tagged Mr. Pompeo, the latest cabinet member to anger him, in his Twitter post.

With 30 days left in office, Mr. Trump’s dismissive statements made clear there would be no serious effort by his administration to punish Russia for the hack, and national security officials say they are all but certain to hand off the fallout and response to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Mr. Trump’s tweet was his first comment on the hack, which came to light a week ago. Privately, the president has called the hack a “hoax” and pressured associates to downplay its significance and push alternate theories for who is responsible, two people familiar with the exchanges said.

In contrast to Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden has signaled that he will not let the intrusion, whose full extent is not yet known, go unanswered.

“A good defense isn’t enough,’’ Mr. Biden said Thursday, vowing to impose “substantial costs on those responsible for such malicious attacks.”

Mr. Trump’s comments on Saturday had echoes of his stance toward the hacks during 2016 presidential campaign, when he contradicted intelligence findings that it was Russia who interfered in that election. Two years later, Mr. Trump’s own Justice Department indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers.

What no one in the Trump administration wants to address, at least publicly, is how the Russians managed to evade billions of dollars in American-built defenses designed to alert agencies to foreign intrusions. That question, too, now seems certain to be left to Mr. Biden to answer.

Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that the president’s response was expected because of his “blind spot when it comes to Russia.” But he said he was listening to experts who attributed the attack to Russia.

“What Russia has done is put in place a capacity to potentially cripple us in terms of our electricity, our water, our communications,” he said, suggesting that the United States must respond with a cyberattack of its own.

Christopher Krebs, former cybersecurity chief, said on the same program that he was unaware of the attack at the time that he was fired by Mr. Trump in November. He said that the inability of government officials to detect the attack was because of multiple factors including the old and antiquated information technology systems in use at federal civilian agencies.

When it comes to make-believe disasters, our appetite is endless; yet we’re loath to anticipate real-world disasters until it is too late.

It’s a discrepancy that Dorian Lynskey explores in “Everything Must Go: The Stories We Tell About the End of the World,” which happened to land on my desk as wildfires were tearing through Los Angeles. Lynskey, whose previous book was a “biography” of George Orwell’s novel “1984,” charts the doomsday scenarios that have enthralled and terrified people through the centuries. But our current era also offers us an unrelenting stream of catastrophe from around the world; we can no longer find respite from actual bad news. “What is notable now is that apocalyptic angst has become a constant,” Lynskey writes. “All flow and no ebb.”

Lynskey, a British cultural journalist, has the kind of omnivorous sensibility essential for a project like this. He has immersed himself in pulpy sci-fi, gloomy poetry, the literary criticism of Susan Sontag and the Book of Revelation. He sometimes gets so excited about his cultural stockpile that he can get carried away, letting loose a barrage of examples when a bit more restraint would do; at 500 pages (endnotes included), this is a book that would have lost none of its erudition or energy had it been 25 percent shorter.

But Lynskey also happens to be a terrifically entertaining writer, with a requisite sense of gallows humor. The extremity of his subject provides plenty of absurdity to work with. Reflecting on how a Nobel Prize-winning scientist predicted that “On the Beach” (a 1959 film that takes place after a nuclear war) would be “the movie that saved the world,” he notes wryly: “It is amazing what people thought a novel or a movie could achieve.”",everything must go stories tell end world written dorian lynskey charts doomsday scenarios enthralled terrified people centuries 500 pages,Los Angeles,,TRV,238.185546875,245.71473693847656,240.5259552001953,248.0750732421875,3.1610608461595233,-2.111709620241641,0.9825987999278399,4.152026223647202

(She tells some people she has no children, that “those girls are just after the money”; she tells others that she had 18 children, all of whom abandoned her; she tells others still that her older daughter fled to Venezuela and is being sought by Interpol.) Watching her in action, Laveau-Harvie muses, “She is a kind of flesh and blood pyramid scheme, a human Ponzi. You buy in and you are hooked.”

Over a period of months, Vicki and her sister are finally able to obtain confirmation of their mother’s legal incompetence, thereby ensuring her permanent hospitalization and saving their elderly father from what would be certain death at his wife’s hands.

As sinister as this sounds, Laveau-Harvie tells the story with laugh-out-loud humor, and tremendous heart and insight. She has a poet’s gift for language, a playwright’s sense of drama and a stand-up comic’s talent for timing. But perhaps most remarkable is the generosity of spirit with which she writes about family trauma.

Focusing on the six-year period at the end of her parents’ lives, Laveau-Harvie barely mentions the nightmare of her childhood, comparing her lost memory to the landscape around active volcanos: “If you pause to look beyond your feet and raise your eyes, you see that in the distance, farthest from the volcano, the surface has hardened. It is black and shiny, making inaccessible most of your childhood, but you can distinguish from early on some signs of the long apprenticeship of duplicity that allows you to be standing where you are now, picking your way cautiously through life, not just a puff of smoke and a carbonized crisp of memory in the depths.”

Unlike her sister, who lives outside Vancouver, Laveau-Harvie has managed to “shake free and flee” Canada to Australia, where she feels “reasonably safe because I do not carry a lot of my past.

Things move fast with barely a beat of introduction. Those unfamiliar with the American philanthropists Kristine McDivitt Tompkins and her husband, Douglas Tompkins, may feel in the film’s opening minutes as disoriented as if they’ve been dropped in the wilderness. One catches on that the Tompkins purchased a lot of it: more than one million acres in Argentina and Chile, with the goal of gifting the land back as recognized national parks. The scale of the couple’s ambition teeters on the surreal. Asked in archival footage about a massive snow-flocked volcano on the horizon, Doug casually replies, “Yeah, that came with it.”

The film doesn’t do much besides pair snippets of the Tompkins’ biographies with staggeringly beautiful shots of Patagonia’s natural splendors. An early effort to structure the running time around Kris’s first summit of a mountain named in her honor by her husband, who died in 2015, unspools clumsily and is eventually set aside. Chin, a climber himself, joined Kris on the trek and must have decided the footage was less interesting than the story that brought her and Doug to Chile in the first place — an unusual adventure in 20th-century capitalism that begins in 1968 with Doug and his friend Yvon Chouinard embarking on a nine-month van expedition through South America and returning home to each start apparel companies: one would found Esprit; the other, Patagonia.

These two mountaineers on the precipice of great wealth were also free-spirited “dirtbags,” a word Chin uses with reverence. Yvon doesn’t disagree, explaining, “If you want to understand the entrepreneur, study the juvenile delinquent.” Yvon would soon hire a teenage Kris to work at Patagonia as an assistant packer; she rose to become chief executive.

But the island’s tourism industry is cyclical and vulnerable to external shocks, including the 2002 Bali bombing, the 2017 eruption of the Mount Agung volcano and the coronavirus pandemic.

The jobs can be risky, too. Some of Bali’s workers have full-time contracts that make them eligible for government employment insurance — a perk that includes pension benefits and a payout equivalent to 48 times a worker’s monthly salary if he or she dies on the job. Others, like four of the five young housekeepers who died in the elevator accident last week, are day laborers or contractors who work without a social safety net, sometimes for years.

Some of the Bali resorts that employ staff as long-term day laborers or contractors are large and prosperous enough to pay their foreign staff salaries of $5,000 or $6,000 a month, said Niluh Djelantik, an entrepreneur on the island.

“They think they can get away with it because nobody will find out,” she said.

In the Ayuterra Resort case, the government insurance agency decided to give all five workers insurance payouts of over $10,000. But such charity is rare. And even though the resort gave each of the victims’ families more than $2,600 each, mostly for funeral expenses, it reportedly did so only after requiring them to sign an agreement promising not to sue.

Representatives for Ayuterra Resort, in the Ubud area of Bali, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

I’m based in New York City, which I wouldn’t say is the part of the country that’s experiencing climate change most viscerally. California, for example, with its wildfires and droughts, is much more on the front lines. Alaska is another example; the Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the world and permafrost and glaciers are melting. Alaska’s coasts are expected to experience more storms. Climate change is happening there, which affects the rest of the world.

How do you prepare for a reporting trip when it involves rafting 90 miles down the Colorado River?

I brought a camera, batteries, a GoPro, notebooks and a recorder. It was slightly more overhead than the scientists on the trip were used to. I also brought a solar-powered charger for my camera equipment and recorder, which proved useless. The walls of the Grand Canyon are so high that you only get enough sunlight to charge devices in the middle of the day.

How do you find article ideas?

I just follow the science. I often try to tag along with scientists on their journeys of discovery, and I keep track of what’s being published in scientific journals.

There’s a gap between how much scientists know about a subject and what is still a mystery and in need of additional inquiry; that’s always interesting to me and sometimes frustrating. My editors want clear answers, but scientists often have ambiguous ones.

volcano,Spring Forward: Songs for a New Season,2023-03-28,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/28/arts/music/amplifier-newsletter-spring-songs.html,"Japan, Albeit","Dear listeners,

A few days ago, I was buried up to my neck in volcanic sand.

Literally, and by choice! My sister and I spent a very restorative weekend at a spa, to celebrate her upcoming wedding and to shake off a winter that had been a challenge for each of us. This particular spa has imported natural volcanic sand from Ibusuki, a city in southwest Japan, and for a cool $30 they will have someone rake a hot, heaping quantity of it atop your body until you cannot move. Then you lay there for 15 minutes, letting the mineral-rich sand work its supposedly detoxifying magic and, if you are like me, expelling such an ungodly amount of perspiration from your face that an attendant who sees maybe a hundred people through this process each day remarks with slightly concerned awe, “Wow, you’re really sweating.”

For the first few minutes, I felt like a corpse. By the end, though, as I wriggled out of the earth and once again stood upright, I have never felt more like a freshly sprouting flower in springtime. (Albeit an exceptionally sweaty one who had to sit on the bench for five extra minutes of observation because she’d been deemed a fainting risk.)

The earliest weeks of springtime have such a distinct feeling that I decided to make a playlist to soundtrack them. Late March/early April is a time of rebirth but also of the friction and occasional struggle of transition — the lime-green shoot emerging from the dirt; the chrysalis stage before the butterfly. It’s the April-is-the-cruelest-month part of “The Wasteland.” It’s the “little darling, it’s been a long, cold lonely winter” part of “Here Comes the Sun.” It’s this perfect little 24-word poem by Anaïs Nin that I always find myself thinking of this time of year:

And then the day came,

when the risk

to remain tight

in a bud

was more painful

than the risk

it took

to Blossom.

Flowers are a recurring motif on this playlist: Waxahatchee’s blooming and then withering lilacs “marking the slow, slow, slow passing of time”; Hurray for the Riff Raff’s bemused cataloging of poetic plant names (“Rhododendron, night blooming jasmine, deadly nightshade…”). So, too, is rebirth and that worthwhile risk to bloom. Perhaps selfishly, I sneaked in one song in about “smoke floating over the volcano,” but that’s from an album I find speaks to a lot of these themes anyway, Caroline Polachek’s excellent, recently released “Desire, I Want to Turn Into You.” My perennial favorites Nina Simone and the Mountain Goats make appearances, but don’t say I didn’t warn you in my introductory “11 Songs That Explain Me.”

Speaking of which! Thank you so much for all your wonderful submissions when I asked last week for a song that describes you. I wish I could have included every one of them, but I wanted to share a few of my favorites below. So many of your responses were such vivid reminders of the humanizing power of music and the bone-deep connection we all have to certain songs.

The various takes on “Showgirls” nowadays cover a wide spectrum in which serious-minded dissections counterbalance the midnight-screening crowd’s laughter and the drag satires. The movie is “revered both at the ‘low’ end of pop culture as a hardy cult favorite, and at the ‘high’ end by academics as a critical fetish object,” Adam Nayman wrote in his book “It Doesn’t Suck: ‘Showgirls.’”

“Most films are so cut and dry: you see it and it’s forgettable,” said Jeffrey McHale, who directed the documentary “You Don’t Nomi” (2020), about the enduring pull of Verhoeven’s divisive feature. “‘Showgirls’ sticks with you.

“We’ve had death by a thousand cuts going on for at least a decade in New Zealand,” said Colin Peacock, the producer and presenter of the Radio New Zealand show Mediawatch. “This feels like a tipping point.”

The mine, constructed on leased federal lands, could help address the near total reliance by the United States on foreign sources of lithium.

But the project, known as Lithium Americas, has drawn protests from members of a Native American tribe, ranchers and environmental groups because it is expected to use billions of gallons of precious ground water, potentially contaminating some of it for 300 years, while leaving behind a giant mound of waste.

volcano,The Icelandic Secret to Happiness? Elf-Actualization.,2022-10-04,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/books/review/looking-for-the-hidden-folk-nancy-marie-brown.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland, Newton","Brown asks those who snicker at this national predilection to examine their own assumptions: “Are gravity and dark matter real? What do we mean when we say something is real?” These questions are not purely rhetorical. At a cultural moment when fantasy and physics continually conjure the multiverse, the medieval theory that there are “nine overlapping worlds, one being the home of the elves,” ought not to be ruled out, she suggests. When the first Icelandic sagas emerged in the 12th century, their interconnected stories of elves, warriors and mortals helped people find an organized logic to the hardships they endured in their rugged land. Lately, ethnographers have plotted the ancient tales onto a topographical map, and discovered that the elves “come across as embodiments of the landscape itself.” Or, as she explains, “Each folk tale gets a dot on the map.” Contrasting the belief systems of Norse mythology with the theories of Newton, Einstein and contemporary physicists who explain the universe through invisible phenomena, Brown argues that an elf-curious attitude is not “silly”: “It’s the physics of the 21st century.”

Brown fell under the spell of Iceland’s dramatic mountains, glaciers, volcanoes and saga-steeped citizenry on her first visit to the country, in 1986. Since then, she has returned 30 times, walking heaths cushioned by thyme, riding horseback across “high deserts of lava and snow,” and driving to watch a volcanic eruption, its flame cut by steam coils that “jetted up pink in the glow.” Her immersion in the country’s fantastical terrain has led her to write half a dozen lyrical nonfiction books rooted in Icelandic myth and history — her record of a parallel universe that feels to her like a magical “Otherworld.”

A few years ago, Brown accompanied the activist elf-seer Ragnhildur Jonsdottir on a tour of the Galgahraun lava fields outside Reykjavik. Jonsdottir came to international attention in 2013, when she waged a campaign to block the construction of a road that would have destroyed an elf church (which looked to the unexalted eye like rocks). Writing a letter on behalf of the congregants to Iceland’s president and other politicians, she demanded that they uphold the “pact between men and elves.” The elves won: In 2015, the road was rerouted to skirt the church, and a 75-ton boulder chapel was moved by hydraulic crane to sit beside it. The elves, Jonsdottir reported, were content with the arrangement.

As much as Brown relishes the blurring of the “nature/culture divide” in Iceland, she does not herself believe in elves. Nonetheless, she shares Jonsdottir’s inclusive vision of a society that respects “worlds, gods and stones.” Even confirmed skeptics are likely to come away from this deeply mined literary, sociological and philosophical excavation of Iceland’s heritage with a new appreciation of the place the huldufólk occupy in the country’s identity, and of the role that similar spirits once served for ordinary people across the globe. How, she asks, did this belief “evolve from perilous to ridiculous?” How did elf-seers go from being cursed quarterly by priests — even burned at the stake — to being labeled kooks?

In “Looking for the Hidden Folk,” Brown overlays a glowing web of connections on Iceland’s folkloric — and literal — landscape of ice and fire, illuminating the answers to the many questions she poses. Her passionate defense of the huldufólk would gratify the most sensitive elf. Following the successful opposition to the Galgahraun road, Jonsdottir dubbed herself the elves’ “speaker in the human world.” In Brown, they have found another.",iceland people believe nine worlds one home elves first icelandic sagas emerged 12th century interconnected stories helped people find organized logic hardships endured,Iceland,,ISB.IC,102.0823745727539,105.1346664428711,105.47381591796875,99.19964599609375,2.990028281465793,0.3225857717272979,3.322259458999722,-2.8239239033430215

This is not because the island is dry. There is plenty of rain. The trouble is that there is tremendous demand for this water and much of it that does accumulate on the island’s surface disappears before it can be used.

New research by marine geophysicists reveals that underground rivers running off the large island’s western coast are a key force behind this vanishing act.

Fresh water is often pumped on the island from aquifers formed from rain at higher elevations where it is easy to access. The drawback is that if too much water gets pumped to meet demand, little remains to travel through rocks to farms and fragile ecosystems that depend upon it. To make matters worse, recent studies of this water labeled with isotopes and tracked over time have revealed that these aquifers are also heavily leaking somewhere else.

“Everyone assumed that this missing fresh water was seeping out at the coastline or traveling laterally along the island,” said Eric Attias, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Hawaii, who led the new study published Wednesday in Science Advances. “But I had a hunch that the leak might be subsurface and offshore.”",new research marine geophysicists reveals underground rivers running large islands western coast key force behind vanishing act fresh water often pumped island aquifers formed rain,Hawaii,,HE,33.99281692504883,33.527400970458984,32.703983306884766,31.97901725769043,-1.3691597128182844,-2.455954352977532,-3.7914881282296413,-5.924191783807296

On Tuesday, the audience at “Drag Race France Live,” a stage version of France’s “RuPaul’s Drag Race” equivalent, erupted in cheers at the mere mention of the Games’ opening ceremony.

The host of both shows, the drag queen Nicky Doll, made jokes about her own appearance in the outsize display on the Seine river, which was directed by Thomas Jolly. Then she hinted at the international backlash to the tableau she took part in, which some people read as a mockery of the biblical Last Supper — or even a display of Satanism.

“If I’m a Satanist, I sold my soul for waterproof products,” Nicky Doll told the crowd, referring to the downpour of rain that marred the show in July.

For French drag, the Olympics’ opening ceremony came at a pivotal moment.

France was relatively late to embracing American-style drag: While the country has a long cabaret tradition, it used to favor “transformiste” drag performers, who impersonate real-life artists instead of creating a character of their own. “Drag Race France,” the TV show, didn’t premiere until 2022.

The wait is over. Americans will vote today after a presidential campaign season that many say has been darker than any in recent memory. In the final hours, candidates, staff members and tens of thousands of volunteers were in an all-out sprint, with the race deadlocked and the country on edge. Here’s the latest.

Donald Trump delivered a 90-minute, grievance-filled speech in North Carolina yesterday, while Kamala Harris focused all of her energy on Pennsylvania, the largest of the seven swing states that will choose the next president.

Trump continued to depict the nation in dark and menacing terms, often mentioning immigration and crime. Harris emphasized a theme of unity and talked about bolstering the economy and restoring federal abortion rights.

You May Not Like the Answers.,2024-10-30,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/science/earth-continents-geology-research.html,"silica, New Zealand, Australia","Of course, if Africa is still attached to Asia through the Gulf of Aden and North America is still attached to Europe, this kind of messes up the “Seven Continents” song. If the crust between these continents is stretching but not snapping, is it well-defined enough to identify the two land masses as separate continents? Or are they still one?

Then there is New Zealand, which really wrecks things for our kids.

Although New Zealand and Australia are often grouped together, they are not on the same continent. While Australia is widely considered to be a continent in its own right, the notion that New Zealand is part of its own continent, Zealandia, is a newer argument.

Submerged shelves that rise high above the ocean floor stretch for miles far beyond the tiny island nation. Along the edges of those shelves, there is deep water and oceanic crust that is thinner than the crust beneath the shelves. Drill cores, seabed dredge samples and rocks collected from the region show that the giant mass that New Zealand sits on is composed of igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks rich in silica, just as is the case with all other continents.

While few think of Zealandia as a continent in cultural terms, “it is increasingly being recognized as a geological one,” Dr. Mortimer said.

But not everyone agrees, and they point to that meddlesome fourth criterion ignored in most textbooks. The crust making up Zealandia is between 10 and 30 kilometers thick, making it thicker than the seven kilometers of most ocean crust. But it is not as thick as other continents’ crust, typically between 30 and 46 kilometers. This makes the boundaries between Zealandia and the ocean less well defined and more difficult to discern. Size creates issues too. At 4.9 million square kilometers, the proffered Zealandia is much smaller than Australia, which itself is only 7.7 million square kilometers.",although new zealand australia often grouped together continent australia widely considered continent right notion new zealand part continent zealandia,New Zealand,,FPH.NZ,35.88384246826172,35.47584533691406,35.814186096191406,36.22218322753906,-1.136993987498743,0.9537214858846124,-0.1941162575661223,0.9428777299326205

Mars is no different. Now, thanks to an intrepid robot parked on the Martian surface by NASA in November 2018, scientists have a map of our neighboring world’s geologic abysses, the first ever made of another planet.

NASA’s InSight lander has been listening to marsquakes and tracking their seismic waves as they journey through the planet. A trio of papers published Thursday in the journal Science, using data InSight has collected, reveals the red planet to be something like a colossal candy treat imagined by a ravenous deity. Its crust is split into two or three layers of volcanic chocolate. The mantle below has a surprisingly sizable and rigid toffee-like filling. And the planet’s core is surprisingly light — less nougaty center, more syrupy heart.

Paired with recent activities at the surface by new NASA and Chinese robotic rovers, these missions highlight stark differences between our blue world and the red one next door.

This survey of the Martian insides has been a long time coming. Earth’s solid-but-squishy mantle was first glimpsed in 1889, when seismic waves from a quake in Japan dove in and out of the layer before emerging in Germany. Earth’s liquid outer core was discovered in 1914, and the solid inner core was revealed in 1936.

It’s Thanksgiving, and for many of us it’ll be smaller and quieter than in years past. I recommend taking a minute to read Mark Vanhoenacker on how he’s fending off sadness at not being with family for the holiday; it might broaden your perspective. And check out Sam Sifton on adding new flavors to your Thanksgiving dinner — in the absence of a crowd, you too might veer from the traditional menu and “play the deep cuts.” (I like the sound of a pumpkin layer cake with caramel buttercream.)

My own Thanksgiving plans have been scuttled this year, but I’m looking forward to taking a walk through Brooklyn with some of my crew and eating turkey breast sandwiches en route (weather permitting). When it gets dark, I’ll get on a video call with the people I’m missing and we’ll indulge in everyone’s most- and least-favorite holiday custom: reciting what we’re thankful for.

I asked you last week what you’re feeling gratitude for this year and certain things came up repeatedly: health, therapy, family that’s come home to quarantine, support systems and, especially, the internet, for the video schooling, socially-distanced visits, information, entertainment and online shopping it provides. Check out some of the other replies below.

“With my job demands doubled but my paycheck halved, my folks made space in their overcrowded flat for me. Almost drowning in a debt of my own making, their generosity has helped me to get back on track, financially and professionally.” —Gwendolyn Ledger, 47, Santiago, Chile

“This year I’m going to make more of an effort to let my co-workers know how much they mean to me. I work in the nursing program at Mercy College. I am grateful to be part of such a wonderful team. We are working hard to graduate smart, caring, competent and “tough” New York nurses. This year it is clear that it is more important than ever.” — Karen K., New York

“I am thankful for my husband’s mechanical prowess that has kept my ancient bicycle rolling all through the pandemic.” —Lindsay O., 64, Chicago

“I’m grateful because I survived Covid-19 and so did my parents. Particularly my dad, a 72-year-old diabetic, who spent 19 days at the hospital with oxygen. Our perspective on our lives is surely different after these months and what I’m most grateful for is that now I really try to enjoy each day as if it was the last.” —Emilio Herrera, 23, Monterrey, Mexico

“I’m thankful that my limited accessibility to social interactions has me placing greater attention on my friendships during those rare, in-person meetings. For example, during a socially-distanced cocktail hour with neighbors last weekend, I begged my wife for “just ten more minutes” when we had to leave. It was a comically juvenile response, but the sentiment was true.” —Matt Cascarino, 49, Buffalo

“I am grateful for the woman who walked by me on the street and smiled, reminding me that there are still ways to connect with people from a distance. We were both wearing masks, but I could tell that she smiled; you know how sometimes you can just tell?” —Rebecca S., 25, Brooklyn

As for me, I’m thankful for this recording of John Prine and Kurt Vile playing Prine’s “Speed of the Sound of Loneliness” and “Sam Stone” in Philadelphia in 2018. The smell of wood-burning fireplaces wafting through the window on recent chilly nights.

In the first major election night of 2025, two Trump-backed Republicans won special congressional elections in Florida, shoring up their party’s slim House majority at a crucial moment for President Trump’s domestic agenda. Both victories had been expected.

In Wisconsin, where a race for a State Supreme Court seat morphed into a referendum on Elon Musk’s role in politics, Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate, overcame $25 million in spending by Musk to handily defeat a conservative. The race could have implications for Wisconsin’s delegation to Congress.

“Most statewide races here are very close,” said my colleague Reid Epstein, who covered the vote there. “What it has never had before is a single political benefactor” — specifically, Musk and groups tied to him — “having so much skin in the game behind one candidate.”

We just revisited Hawaii VOLCANOES National Park a few weeks ago, so we’re happy that clue made the cut. We’ve been solving crosswords for a long time, but started getting into constructing a few years ago and really started focusing on it more during quarantine. Quick shout-out to Doug Peterson for his encouragement and feedback in our early constructing phases! Victor: The idea for this puzzle started with a line from the song Apocalypse by Cigarettes After Sex (take a listen!), and originally had BODYLANGUAGE as a revealer, with something like SYMPATHIZE, CANTONESE and CHICAGOOHARE. We decided that limiting it to the face made for a tighter set, and switched to ABOUTFACE as a revealer, before watching a John Oliver episode about Clearview AI and settling on FACE RECOGNITION, which felt more topical and interesting. We submitted the puzzle with high hopes and (Technology used controversially by law enforcement … ) as the original clue for the revealer.

Once poolside, they have to effect pleasant expressions and no sign of fatigue or pain while they wait for the score, no matter bad it is.

Every team at the Games performs three routines — technical, free and acrobatic — and each routine has its own theme and music. (The United States won silver in the team finals on Wednesday night, behind China; the duet competitions, made up of two athletes from each country, start on Friday.) The themes can depict narratives, as in Spain’s world-championship-winning routine set to Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” in 2009 — if you look closely, you might spot the bustle in the hedgerow.

Its handful of houses hide behind a dune covered with morning glories and pandanus trees, the chitter of cicadas interrupted only by the cadence of waves and the call of an azure-winged jay.

In July, the beach became part of a new UNESCO World Heritage Site, a preserve of verdant peaks and mangrove forests in far southwestern Japan that is home to almost a dozen endangered species.

Two months later, the placid air was split by a new sound: the rumble of trucks and excavators preparing to strip away a large section of Katoku’s dune and bury inside of it a two-story-tall concrete wall meant to curb erosion.

It’s rare to experience art in a nearly totally dark room. But last year at the National Nordic Museum in Seattle, that’s where visitors found themselves when they entered “FLÓÐ (Flood),” a site-specific installation created by the Icelandic artist and musician Jonsi (Jon Birgisson).

Lit only by an LED strip running the length of the ceiling, the installation featured gentle fog misting into the space and looping audio of some 25 minutes of Jonsi’s music. Featuring choral singing and field recordings made in the Icelandic countryside, the sound rolled through the room like a wave. The subtle scent that wafted in via hidden diffusers was an earthy coastal smell crafted from tinctured and distilled seaweed.

Today, artists like Jonsi and his family-run collective, Fischersund, are moving art beyond the realm of the visual and into experiences that need to be heard, felt and even smelled to be believed. The success of these experiences has inspired them to keep creating them.

When the Museum of Modern Art inaugurated its latest expansion almost exactly a year ago — in another era — Rivane Neuenschwander’s installation “Work of Days” was among the most subtle and serene of the celebratory exhibitions. It consisted of a room tiled entirely with squares of white paper embedded with little specks — dust, hair and what not — the stuff continually floating to earth all around us, every second of every day. It was a perfect summation of this Brazilian artist’s modesty, and her love of the random, the collaborative and the ephemeral.

But things have changed for the worse since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and its frequent mishandling, especially in Brazil and the United States. Ms. Neuenschwander, like many people, is experiencing a certain rage. As a result, she has made some of the most furiously beautiful — and nonephemeral — works of her career: most notably the five violent, gorgeously colored tapestries and five small paintings on wood that are part of her series “Tropics: Damned, Orgasmic and Devoted.” They form the centerpiece of her unsettling exhibition at Tanya Bonakdar.",tropics damned orphaned devoted display museum modern art exhibition collection works art inspired natural world,Brazil,,PBR,2.528416395187378,2.51442813873291,2.6053531169891357,2.339571714401245,-0.5532418030943483,3.6161295228761317,3.0428817796071965,-7.468891640854028

During the first week of the federal election campaign, politicians have been asked about: the price of bread, milk and petrol; the JobSeeker rate; the wage price index; the cash rate; the unemployment rate, and more.

We still have five weeks to go, and I’m already exhausted.

When the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese failed to correctly name the cash rate and unemployment rate on the first day of the campaign, it prompted widespread media coverage, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison seized on the opportunity to label his opponent as weak on the economy. Other politicians received pop quizzes on various other prices and statistics over the next two days, before it all screeched to a halt on Wednesday, when the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, excoriated the news media after being asked for the wage price index.

“Google it,” he responded, adding: “Politics should be about reaching for the stars and offering a better society. And instead, there’s these questions that are asked about — can you tell us this particular stat or can you tell us that particular stat.”

Stream it on Hulu.

Why doesn’t this bonkers mix of science fiction, horror and action have the cult status it so richly deserves? In this 2020 movie, Chloë Grace Moretz (“Let Me In,” “Kick-Ass”) plays a seemingly fearless officer, Maude Garrett, who boards a B-17 bomber in 1943, carrying a mysterious package. Over the course of a rather eventful flight she must battle the crew’s rank sexism, enemy fighter planes and a giant, bloodthirsty rodent-like stowaway.

Any one of these adversaries would be enough for a movie, but the New Zealand director Roseanne Liang deftly handles all three at a breathless pace. The first third, which Maude mostly spends alone in a gun turret under the plane’s belly, is especially gripping, making the most of the tight space and our fearless heroine overhearing the Airmen’s dumb comments on the communications system.

Maude gets out of many pickles during the tight running time, but one in particular is so insane, it might well make you laugh in sheer delight.

There’s a final chapter about the 21st century that I’d originally intended as a travelogue. I would leave the studies behind and hit the road to interview the members of today’s secessionist movements, in Texas, California, Alaska, Hawaii, New England.

But I got married, I had kids, and the history was so absorbing that I just didn’t get around to it. But the other reason that changed is because the idea of division suddenly became more relevant. I thought I’d have to go look for evidence of secession today, but it kind of came to me, with Trump’s election and the uproar for secession in California, which lasted a few months. And this whole question about whether there could be a second civil war. Charlottesville happened. This all made it much easier for me to show that these questions weren’t just antiquated but relevant to contemporary American life.

What creative person (not a writer) has influenced you and your work?

Frederick Law Olmsted. He was a writer for a little while, but we know him as the designer of Central Park and Prospect Park. I live on Prospect Park, which a lot of people say — and I think — is his masterpiece. I have this pet theory about it: that it’s a visual, physical metaphor for the union, and was intended as such by Olmsted. He started working on it in 1866, after the war. The great flaw in Central Park, which had been designed before the Civil War, was the transverse roads that go east to west and divide it. When Olmsted inherited Prospect Park, there was also going to be a road running through it — Flatbush Avenue. And he said, no, no, that won’t work, for reasons that I think have to do with the Civil War and his experience with it. So he moved the park entirely to one side of Flatbush to give it unity.

The other thing I love about the park is that the whole idea behind it is artifice, that art could surpass nature, so he was sculpting the land the way a sculptor might a block of marble. But that’s not how nature works. The hills he built up are constantly eroding, and the ingenious water system he created immediately broke down. So if it is a metaphor for the union, it shows that maintenance has to happen constantly. The park — and the union, I think — is not this one-time creation that can run by itself. It requires this great investment of work and, really, love.

Your friends or family are traveling to Iceland to experience its waterfalls and glaciers, its whales and volcanoes, and its summer nights, which are so bright that they may penetrate your dreams.

You, on the other hand, were intrigued when you heard that there were more published authors in Iceland than in any other country (per capita, of course, which makes everything a little easier for us, with our population of around 350,000), that everyone is a poet and that literature is as important as cod, milk and the weather.

I don’t know if any of that is true. But it could be — and, for our purposes, that is good enough.

What should I read before I pack my bags?

It might not be a bad idea to read some of the Icelandic Sagas before your departure. The Sagas are prose narratives — in many ways not so distant relatives of the modern novel — written mostly in the 13th and 14th centuries, about the goings-on among the settlers of Iceland four centuries prior. As you might imagine, they are rich in struggle and conflict, honor and betrayal, bloodshed and beauty. Medieval and modern at the same time, they are collectively Icelanders’ second Bible.

You can’t help but agree with the novelist Jane Smiley, who called the Sagas “a great world treasure,” or with the poet Seamus Heaney, who said they were “a testimony to the human spirit’s ability not only to endure what fate may send it but to be renewed by the experience.” Or you may be more taken with this review from Katherine Lyle, an Amazon customer: “Highly recommended.

Among them is the dispute over oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which has simmered since the 1970s, and the fight over the Ambler Road, a proposal for a 210-mile mine-access road, part of which would run through Gates of the Arctic National Park. The project is a relative newcomer, having been first proposed in the 2000s.

Clearly, environmental disputes in Alaska are in a league of their own. The reasons are complex, but here’s a quick basic look at some of them.

There’s a lot of environment to fight over. Alaska is a behemoth, and aside from the Anchorage area, Fairbanks and Juneau, still largely undeveloped, with more wilderness by far than any other state. The law at the center of the King Cove dispute, for instance, in one fell swoop provided protection for 104 million acres of land. That’s an area the size of California, and nearly 5 percent of the total land area of the United States.

There are a lot of resources to fight over, too. The metals that the Pebble Mine would extract are estimated to be worth $300 billion. The commercial salmon fishery that opponents say the mine would harm generates about $2 billion in economic benefits a year, according to a recent report. These are just two examples the state’s richness in resources. Oil is another, with tens of billions of barrels already produced and billions more thought to be present in places like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

It’s not just environmentalists vs. business interests. Another seminal piece of federal legislation, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, was an effort to treat Indigenous peoples in the state more justly than they were treated in the Lower 48 under the reservation system. In return for giving up aboriginal claims to Alaska’s land, the act established for-profit Native corporations, both regional and local, and transferred about 40 million acres of land to them. Native corporations are everywhere in the state, and thus have been involved in many of the environmental fights, on both sides. In the King Cove road dispute, for example, the local Native corporation wants the road, arguing that it is needed for medical emergencies. But some Native corporations elsewhere are against it, concerned that by going through the wildlife refuge the road would affect populations of migratory geese that their members have traditionally hunted for food.",environmental disputes alaska league reasons complex heres quick basic look,California,,PCG,-3.0,12.139594078063965,12.189347267150879,11.980387687683105,-3.0,0.40984227946152835,-3.0,-3.0

Right? Wrong!” Thus began Clive Barnes’s review of the first post-Merman “Gypsy” on Broadway, staged by Laurents. Lansbury had “shattered the town,” Barnes wrote, just as Merman had, but in an altogether different way. After reading that review in the library at Swarthmore College, where I was a sophomore, I hied myself to New York and scored cancellation tickets. (And yes, I cried when Lansbury appeared in the aisle.) She probably understood the language of vaudeville better than any Rose, and she struck clear-cut, music-hall-style poses that she proceeded to fill in with rippling shadows. Her Rose had a sharp alacrity, a smiling confidence pocked with suggestions of a restless narcissism. You never forget your first. I can recall the chills I felt when Lansbury suddenly turned feral with the lyrics “Momma is gonna see to it!” in the peppy first-act finale “Everything’s Coming Up Roses,” or when in a hypnotized state of self-delusion, she kept bowing to a silent audience after “Rose’s Turn.”

This was a woman who understood just how lowdown the world of on-the-road vaudeville and burlesque was, and how hard you had to be to survive it.

Weary of living in fear that the devastating flooding would reoccur, the women of Damaran Baru decided it was time to play a more active role in protecting their environment.

However, in Indonesia, where patriarchal culture is deeply rooted, women’s roles are habitually diminished, and women are often overlooked in many fields of work. Being a ranger is considered a man’s job and thus taboo for women in Aceh, where Islam is the dominant religion and which is the only Indonesian province to have implemented Shariah law.

“Even though, most often, women are the ones who feel the direct impact from environmental loss and climate change, there was a lot of resistance when we brought up the idea of creating a women ranger team,” said Rubama, a community conservation officer for the Forest, Nature and Environment Aceh Foundation, which funds the ranger initiative. “Women are often left out and not allowed to do many roles in Aceh, especially at the village level.”

One, the Stammheim Missal (1170-1180), now resides in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. I acquired it from a German noble family who had owned it for around 200 years, and sold it in the mid-1990s to the Getty. I still think it’s the best manuscript in their collection. Another favorite is the 10th-century Etymologiae written by Isidore of Seville. In the 19th century, a collector split the book into two parts, the second of which was passed down to a European collector. This collector came to me in the hope that we might find the first part and reunite the two. The missing half was found, and after 200 years, it was rebound and complete again.

TENSCHERT Having privately bought an incredibly rich 14th-century Book of Hours, illuminated throughout and with 60 (!) full-page miniatures by the so-called Martainville Master, we found out that this must have been the personal prayer book of Queen Catherine of Aragon, Henry VIII’s first wife. The manuscript sold immediately. I can’t share the name of the buyer or the price, only that it is an American customer. Americans are waking up to this kind of collectible.

Advice for starting a rare-book collection?

SHAPERO The only advice to any collector, in every field, is buy what you like. This does not mean that you should not do your research or educate yourself in this field — in fact, this is essential — but that however the value moves, up or down, you will always have that love and appreciation of what you own.

TENSCHERT Buy only the most beautiful object you can afford, weed out anything run-of-the-mill or in poor condition. As a lover of books, I must tell you to please keep away from single miniatures, let alone cuttings which remind you only of their being the slaughterhouse waste of once-complete manuscripts.

CLAVREUIL Whatever the budget is, visit as many bookshops as you can and meet the experts in order to figure out the kind of collection you want to build. Trust and learn from booksellers.

GÜNTHER There is no set of rules for collecting, but be clear in your motivations.

But as a new show that opens at Gray Chicago next month proves, Katz is still driven by a need to create. “What gets me going every morning is knowing I’m going into the studio to paint,” he says. While many of his landscapes have been inspired by Lincolnville, Me., where Katz has spent several months of the year since the 1950s, the 11 new compositions on view (which will be presented alongside a series of 16 new ink portraits on paper) started taking shape on crisp morning walks that Katz took in New York last fall. “I looked up and saw all these colored leaves against a blue sky. They were relatively small trees, and the leaves stood out distinctly,” he recalls. “I felt a sensation of brightness and tried to paint this sensation.” Across enormous canvases (some measuring as wide as 14 feet), he depicts the windblown trees and delicate foliage of the changing season in vibrant golds, greens and reds.

Many people were believed to be still trapped beneath the rubble, leading to fears that the death toll would rise. As far as 60 miles away, in the capital, Jakarta, the quake shook furniture and tall buildings. See photos from the disaster.

Emergency workers and others scrambled overnight to find trapped people, dealing with blocked roads, landslides and hundreds of collapsed buildings. Rescue efforts were hampered because the main hospital had been damaged and had lost electrical power, an official said. Many people, unable to reach medical care, were being treated wherever they had been injured, he added.

The quake was very shallow, occurring at a depth of only six miles, according to official records. Shallow quakes can often be more destructive than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, losing less energy along the way.

She had moved into a small house. Her business supplying fabric for lampshades was lucrative but unfulfilling. Ms. Komara sipped her wine and smoked a cigarette. She sank to the floor, dipping her hands into two wooden chests filled with antique Indonesian textiles.

In one chest, Ms. Komara recently recalled, were batik designs from the island of Java, in the other elaborate weavings from Indonesia’s outer islands. She swallowed more wine, inhaled clove-scented smoke from an Indonesian cigarette — and considered how to enrich the heritage of a nation of more than 17,000 islands.

(Visitors pay a $75 entry tax as well as a $40 nature fee, which allows access to the island’s marine park and national park.)

More than 50 of the destination’s roughly 85 dive sites are accessible from shore, meaning certified divers won’t need a guided boat excursion — a big savings — to swim among staghorn corals and schools of tropical fish. At beaches like 1,000 Steps — an exaggeration of the 67 limestone steps required to reach it — both divers and snorkelers can view marine wonders and stick around for sunset over the cactus-studded horizon.

Home to few large hotels, Bonaire offers many vacation rentals and small resorts. Bamboo Bonaire, for example, has cottages, with kitchenettes and furnished porches within a lush walled compound (doubles from $225 a night; stays of five nights or more are eligible for 20 percent off).

People don’t understand that the reason communities have been hurt over many decades is because of policies by successive governments, whether they were well-meaning or they were intentionally harmful. What we have constantly is: One government comes in, they choose something, another government comes in, they rip out the program. It’s not even that we can’t make progress, it’s that every government thinks they know better around what we need.

Australians really do believe in this idea of a fair go, so it’s almost inconceivable to the middle of Australia that the government could be intentionally doing something wrong to people and we wouldn’t know about it. It’s like, “Well, I would know about that if that’s what was happening. Why would they do that? It has to be you that’s the problem.”

On what this moment could mean for Australia

We know that the majority of Australians want a national unity moment with First Nations people. But right now, we’re selling the details on constitutional recognition and the idea of how inclusion happens, or who we are as a nation, is getting left off the table.

I really believe that we are almost within Australia’s Brexit moment here, if this goes negatively. There’s going to be a lot of regret. It’s going to impact the political psyche of this country and how we move forward together. On an international level, how will people perceive Australia as a nation if a “no” vote happens? There’s not going to be the nuance of what happened in the debate, what was the misinformation. It’s just going to be seen for what it is: a rejection of First Nations people by Australian voters.

On her initial hesitation to support the Voice proposal

I went back and forth around whether or not I supported the Voice to Parliament or the referendum. Many years ago, I campaigned against symbolic constitutional recognition because I didn’t believe that a few words in the constitution would change anything.

Cameron Carling, 38, left to pursue a dream life in Costa Rica. Then he quit that, too.

I moved to New York in 2007 from Los Angeles, where I had been living after college at U.C.L.A. You show up in New York for a week in September, and you’re like, This is the most magical goddamned place on the planet. This is where all of the things are happening in the world.

I had no job, and figured that New York would just provide for me, and it nearly didn’t. I was on the verge of running out of borrowed money when I landed a job at a huge tech company via a temp agency. That turned into a full-time gig, and I ended up working there for 11 years.

I met my wife, Marcella, two weeks after I arrived, at a party. New York was awesome as a couple with no kids. We would go to outdoor movies in Bryant Park, see the symphony in Central Park.

But after a decade or so, I started to burn out. Part of it was that my wife and I had two kids and we were living in an 1,100-square-foot apartment in Brooklyn. It’s a common refrain, but trying to raise a kid in New York is like growing an oak tree in a thimble.",cameron carling 38 left pursue dream life costa rica quit moved new york 207 los angeles living,Los Angeles,,TRV,-3.0,125.55268859863281,125.93577575683594,118.7453384399414,-3.0,0.3051206330019575,-3.0,-3.0

In much of the developed world, vaccine orders are soaring and economies are poised to roar back to life. But in poorer nations, the virus rages on. In India, people are gasping for oxygen; thousands are dying daily in Brazil, and vaccination progress in countries as varied as Ghana and Bangladesh has faltered.

That split screen was never supposed to be so stark. A total of 192 countries signed up last year for Covax, a vaccine-sharing partnership, and the Gates Foundation poured $300 million into an Indian factory to make doses for the world’s poor. The European Union’s top executive told a global summit last June, “Vaccination is a universal human right.”

Yet as of mid-April, wealthy countries had secured more than 87 percent of the more than 700 million doses of vaccines dispensed worldwide, while poor countries had received only 0.2 percent, according to the World Health Organization.

By Charlie Kaufman

Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: A man writes a novel, a very long novel full of recondite information and pop-cultural jokes, references spanning from Shakespeare to Hegelian philosophy to contemporary TV, and a plot that involves both omnipresent corporate sponsorship and the pursuit of a film of mysterious power, which exists only as a single copy.

This too-broad summation could describe “Infinite Jest” as easily as it does Charlie Kaufman’s debut novel, “Antkind” — but you only have to pierce the veil on “Antkind” to discern radical differences. After a brief preamble about a gelatinous sea monster, written in a faux 19th-century argot, we are hurled into the mind of one B. Rosenberg, a film critic driving through the Florida darkness, on the way from New York City to St. Augustine to research a book on gender and cinema. (“B.” is a man — or, to use his own iconoclastically devised pronoun, a “thon” — but sticks to the initial for the sake of gender neutrality.) Pompous, opinionated, self-conscious, self-loathing, B. is an astonishing creation: a volcano of ridiculous opinions and absurd neuroses, a balding, bearded nightmare of a person whose involutions could practically carry a 700-page narrative by themselves because they, and he, are so riotously funny.

B. stops for a hamburger at a chain called Slammy’s, worries about his various ailments, worries about his girlfriend — a former sitcom star who’s currently filming on location — pulls up at his rented apartment complex, and is summarily disturbed by a neighbor shouting what B. perceives to be an anti-Semitic slur. When B. knocks on that neighbor’s door, he discovers one Ingo Cutbirth, an elderly gentleman who claims to have appeared as an extra in the film B. has come down to research, a 1914 silent called “A Florida Enchantment.”

Anyone who’s ever seen a Charlie Kaufman film will recognize the landscape here: a loose-but-faithless representation of “reality” that ripples with psychedelic strangeness. The laws of gravity almost — but don’t quite — apply. Ingo claims to have been born in 1908 (later, he corrects himself: 1900), and to have nearly finished a film he has been working on for 90 years. Perhaps B. would like to see it? “This is too good to be true,” B. thinks: “ancient, reclusive, likely psychotic African-American filmmaker. Outsider art, undoubtedly.” Believing he has struck the film critic’s mother lode, B. dives in. (“Finally I can pry open the prudish legs of Cahiers du Cinéma.”) The film is a fever dream: a technologically advanced claymation tale of a lone twin named Bud Mudd who teams up in a comedy duo with a partner named Molloy. It is also three months long. When B. emerges from what he believes is a masterpiece, his life is forever changed. He calls his editor in New York, packs the film into a truck. When he stops at Slammy’s for a soda, he glances back at the parking lot to see — the truck has caught fire! His great discovery is lost.",infinite jest losebutfaithles representation reality ripples psychedelic strangeness film fever dream technologically advanced claymation tale,New York City,,TRV,101.55821228027344,102.19023895263672,99.35516357421875,108.7994613647461,0.6223294583199802,-2.774311330979443,-2.169247229337657,7.130146269696783

Around this time, while publicizing a brand of rum outside a grocery store, she met Bill Riley, an Army cook from Connecticut. They fell in love, quickly married, had three children and were legally joined for 13 years, mostly unhappily, with a long separation toward the end. According to Sharon Riley, her father was often violent with her mother, especially when both had been drinking.

In the 1940s and ’50s, Rexach worked in clubs as the leader of the vocal group el Combo Las Damiselas (later known as el Combo de Sylvia Rexach) and with musical-theater revues, both on the island and occasionally in New York City. She helped form a publishing organization through which she advocated for composers’ rights; wrote scripts for radio and television comedy shows, as well as advertising jingles for aspirin and detergent; and wrote a cultural criticism column for El Diario de Puerto Rico, praising the unsung and the local while reacting against exploitative business practices.

She also raised her children as a single mother, and she wrote songs. About 50 have been published, though a friend, the singer José Luis Torregrosa, believed that many more “were left on the tabletops of the cafes where we were drinking.” Several were recognized during her life through versions by well-known singers — particularly Lucho Gatica’s “Y Entonces,” released in 1959 — but many more came later, as performed by Tito Rodríguez, La Lupe, Cheo Feliciano and others. The song “Alma Adentro” alone has passed through many sensibilities: Linda Ronstadt covered it on her Grammy Award-winning 1992 album, “Frenesí,” as did the New York-based jazz saxophonist Miguel Zenón in 2011. on a record named after the song. Miramar, the bolero revivalist band with roots in Puerto Rico, researched her life before creating their own subtle version, included on their album “Dedication to Sylvia Rexach,” released in 2016, which drew some attention to the composer in the United States. And the Spanish singer Angela Cervantes and the Cuban jazz pianist Pepe Rivero recently released their own version, spreading her work to audiences that barely knew her music.",sylvia rexach worked clubs leader vocal group el combo las damiselas 1943 enlisted womens army corps three months working desk clerk,New York,,TRV,156.19451904296875,154.4533233642578,156.31817626953125,153.14027404785156,-1.1147610616425911,1.2073893035473426,0.07916873608636817,-1.955411120589303
volcano,Have Climate Questions? Get Answers Here.,2023-02-06,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/climate/climate-change-faq.html,the United States,"There has been some good news on climate change. Not enough. But good news nonetheless.



First of all, over the past decade or so, several major economies including the United States have shifted away from burning coal to generate electricity. Coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels, and historically speaking a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.



There are still coal power plants being built in the world, but the overall trend away from coal toward cleaner options, like solar, is progress. The cost to build solar power plants has fallen enough that, in some cases, it is now one of the most price-competitive options for generating electricity. This is a significant financial milestone.



Cars that burn gas are a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse emissions, but in the past few years some of the world’s largest automakers have launched aggressive efforts to pivot to making more electric vehicles while phasing out gasoline models. The importance of a significant polluting industry embracing this change, and competing with one another to be better at it, can’t be underestimated.



Car buyers have been responding. As recently as a half-decade or so ago, electric-car sales were negligible in many parts of the world, but have risen rapidly since. Electric vehicles aren’t perfect of course, but as a general rule they’re cleaner than gasoline cars. (If you’re interested in reading more about that, see the entry in this F.A.Q. for “How green are electric cars?”)



The spread of electric vehicles also means that some of the difficulties of owning one (for example, finding charging stations nearby) will likely resolve themselves more quickly as demand grows from drivers. That, in turn, could encourage sales.



In 2022 the United States passed new legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, that is widely considered the most important legislative effort to fight climate change in the nation’s history by encouraging a transition to cleaner energy and offering a range of incentives to businesses and individuals to clean up their act.



(This Times guide explains how you might be able to claim some of that money by, for instance, buying an electric car or installing a heat pump.)



Lastly, here’s a big one: For reasons like the above, in the past decade or so the world has made significant progress toward slowing global warming and avoiding particularly extreme consequences from climate change. Not nearly enough progress, mind you, but significant nonetheless.



Specifically, before the 2015 Paris Agreement, some estimates put the world on track to warm in the range of 3.6 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times. Scientists widely agree that if average global temperatures were to increase that much, it would be devastating socially and economically. Now, however, according to a United Nations report in 2022, the world is on track to heat between 2.1 degrees and 2.9 degrees by 2100.



That’s still very dangerous.



However, if the nations of the world act as aggressively as they promise, there remains a chance to hold that increase to below 2 degrees Celsius, according to scientists. That’s a big “if,” of course. It would require a tremendous amount of work by the nations of the world, on an extremely swift timetable over the next decade or two, to hit the lower targets for limiting global warming.



However, since you asked about good news, let’s keep it positive. Even if there’s a lot of hard work to do, progress has been made on important fronts.



There’s now even a movement, “OK Doomer,” that basically says, stop it with the gloomy takes and focus on things that will fix the problem.",good news climate change enough good news nonetheless several major economies shifted away burning coal generate electricity,the United States,,TRV,174.75624084472656,177.84481811523438,180.73252868652344,176.06626892089844,1.7673630741760222,1.623724886613212,3.4197850748614425,0.7496316411016496

The Chinese community in San Francisco was outwardly supportive of Taiwan from the 1950s to the early 1990s. But today it is much more connected to mainland China, partly because of immigration trends and the rise of China’s power and influence in the world, according to David Lee, a political science lecturer in San Francisco who specializes in voting trends of the Chinese community.

Taiwanese Americans in the Bay Area had a much different reaction. Several said they were excited by what they considered the culmination of Pelosi’s decades of support for Taiwan.

“The fact that Speaker Pelosi actually visited Taiwan and had public events is thrilling,” said Marie Chuang, a council member in Hillsborough, a suburb just south of San Francisco. “Nancy Pelosi has always been very pro-democracy, pro-human rights, so it’s no surprise that she wanted to make a presence there.

His company, Columbia Sportswear, had long relied on plants in Asia to make its clothing, but that appeared increasingly precarious.

The disruptions of the pandemic had exposed the pitfalls of depending on container ships to move products across the Pacific.

As Columbia’s head of apparel manufacturing, Mr. Burton, 52, was responsible for diminishing the risks. So he was scouting factories in Central America to narrow the distance between the brand’s manufacturing operations and customers in the United States.

He visited Zuntex Apparel, a factory in Guatemala City that was already making modest quantities of Columbia’s hooded sweatshirts and button-down fishing shirts. Could it handle a significantly larger order?

Not that the translation to New York has been seamless. BAM Fisher is the wrong venue for “Sun & Sea,” with the singers and supernumeraries crammed on too small a sandbar, pinned up against ugly gray walls.

Antitrust enforcement is no exception. The department has pursued cases against the president’s enemies, notably investigating an agreement among four auto companies to voluntarily reduce emissions, and it has declined to pursue cases against the president’s friends, allowing T-Mobile to acquire Sprint. But in pursuing the case against Visa, the department is ending the Trump era on a relatively high note, setting an example the Biden administration ought to emulate.

Debit cards, which have soared in popularity in recent decades, allow customers to make purchases by authorizing withdrawals from their bank accounts. Visa operates a system that connects the buyer’s bank and the merchant’s bank. For this service, the merchant pays a fee to Visa and to the bank that issued the card. Other companies offer a similar service, but Visa is the dominant player. It processed about 70 percent of the online debit transactions in the United States last year, a business that produced about $2 billion in profits.

Plaid is not one of Visa’s competitors — yet. The start-up provides the plumbing that lets apps like Venmo, a cash transfer service, or Robinhood, a stock trading platform, access users’ bank accounts. Visa’s dominance rests on its exclusive relationships with the banks that issue debit cards, but Plaid now has relationships with most of the same banks.

Last year, Visa made a small, exploratory investment in Plaid. A few months later, according to the government’s complaint, one of Plaid’s co-founders called Visa to say that the company was for sale, and the price was about $5 billion. Why would Visa pay so much for a company with revenues of $100 million last year? According to the government’s complaint, Plaid made clear that it was planning to get into Visa’s business. The smaller company told Visa that it was preparing to launch a new system for processing online debit payments, with fees of about 50 percent of Visa’s.

One Visa executive described Plaid’s potential as a “volcano” with “just the tip showing above the water,” according to the complaint. Visa estimated it could lose a quarter of its online debit business by 2024.

There are even new apps to make trips easier to plan and enjoy. A number of them were introduced (and some old favorites were updated) back when travel was at a standstill. Wondering which to try? Here is a selection with thoughtful solutions — how to turn award points into a hotel suite, join a ranger for a national park hike, hear the history of the place you’re driving through, see the latest Covid-19 travel protocols — to help you tap and swipe your way to what will hopefully be a new year of adventures.

National Park Service

From Acadia to Zion, at long last there’s a single official park service app for America’s more than 400 national parks. Created by National Park Service staff, the app puts practical information — such as fees, hours, directions, webcams, where to find food and restrooms, park news and events (walking tours, talks, volunteer opportunities) — at your fingertips. Search for parks near you, or search for them by name, state, activity (like horse trekking, caving, dog sledding) or topic (African American heritage, climate change, volcanoes). According to the app, a visit to Alaska is in order if you want to go dog sledding through national parks and preserves, though if horse trekking is more your speed, there are dozens of national sites from which to choose. Download park details for offline use on mountain trails and other spots you don’t have cell service, and keep a running list of the parks you’ve visited. Cost: free.

HearHere — Road Trip Companion

When contemplating a road trip, any number of images might come to mind — and Kevin Costner probably isn’t one of them. Yet that may be about to change. The actor and director is a co-founder of HearHere, an app that uses your location and interests to play audio snippets (some narrated by Mr. Costner) about the history, culture and natural wonders of the places you’re driving through. There are morsels about the things you see (like landmarks) and the things you don’t, like the people who walked the land before you. The app, which rolled out last year, more recently announced an expansion, blossoming from road trip stories set on the West Coast to more than 8,700 stories across the United States, including details about the early history of Portland, Maine; the burning of Washington by British troops in 1814; and the first racially integrated housing in Philadelphia. Available only on iOS. Cost: Free for the first five stories; after that, $29.99 for 30-day unlimited access; $35.99 for a one-year unlimited subscription; $69.99 for three years.

Bublup

Bublup is a cloud storage service where you can save and organize all sorts of content (photos, videos, documents, links, PDFs) in eye-pleasing folders and, if you like, share them with others. For example, say you’re planning a trip to Vermont. With a few taps you can create a vacation folder and choose from the app’s templates to add a packing checklist and a note about things you want to do. You can easily forward flight or car rental confirmation emails, import inspirational photos and videos, and add links to travel articles and potential bed-and-breakfasts. One of the things that makes the app (and desktop version) delightful for visual planners is that you can choose the colors of your folders or even put your own photos on the front of them and as background images inside. Each type of content you add to a folder (be it a link or photo) appears in its own tidy box, which makes scrolling through information less like work and more like, well, vacation. To get started, try Bublup’s “vacation planning” template which has handy folders for flight information, food and beverages, location, lodging options and must-see sights, which you can then customize. Tap “invite” to enable fellow travelers to view or collaborate on your trip planning by adding and editing content. For more ways to use the app for vacation planning, check out Bublup’s blog. Cost: Free for three gigabytes of storage; more storage and features from $2.99 to $9.99 a month or, if paid yearly, from $27.60 to $94.80.

volcano,D.J.T. Is No F.D.R.,2020-03-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/trump-coronavirus-new-deal.html,Washington,"This meant an end to the timid policies of the past and the orthodoxy that constrained Washington in the face of crisis and the start of a new, energetic approach to wielding the powers of the federal government. Roosevelt called for “direct recruiting by the government itself” to relieve unemployment and “direct efforts to raise the values of agricultural products” to prevent “the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and farms.” He called for “unifying of relief activities” and “national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character.” And he insisted that all of this is “feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors.” The Republic was under stress, but it hadn’t been broken.

As Roosevelt neared the end of his address, he returned to the language of ethics as well as the language of war:

If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize as we have never realized before our interdependence on each other; that we cannot merely take but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline.

The American people craved leadership and Roosevelt delivered it, taking center stage in the nation’s political life and holding it for the next 12 years. Still, it would be another two years before his legislative program matched his rhetorical ambitions. It was the so-called second New Deal of the Social Security Act and the National Labor Relations Act that fundamentally altered the federal government’s relationship to its citizens.

The larger point, however, is this: It took more than competence and ability to resolve the crisis of the 1930s. President Herbert Hoover was competent (in the early 1920s he spearheaded a relief effort that saved millions of Russians from starvation in the wake of famine and civil war); Hoover was able. But Hoover was committed to a failed orthodoxy, unable to think beyond the dogma of the past. Roosevelt wasn’t a blank slate, but he was flexible. He could think creatively about government, and his allies were eager to experiment. They brought openness and imagination to Washington and helped save the country in the process.

As we face what may become the great crisis of our age, we need that Rooseveltian leadership: flexible, creative and deeply aware of the power of words. Roosevelt’s first inaugural wasn’t just an impressive speech; it was a harbinger of things to come. Like nearly all of the most memorable presidential rhetoric, it cleared the way for action, pointing the country toward a singular goal. Put another way, the Roosevelt of March 1933 did not know how the future would unfold, but he understood the power he had to shape the limits of what was possible — and he didn’t hesitate to put it to work.

It’s a place defined by absence, or at least extreme sparseness. Of water, of life. Whatever is determined enough to exist there — people, plants, animals, even microbes — must be hardy, resilient and well adapted. From the road, I’d seen life hanging on. I’d ventured into the desert and also seen what dryness preserves (bones, ruins) and what it exposes (mineral riches, the stars).

Chuquicamata, the world’s largest open-pit copper mine, a hole big enough to swallow Central Park, is nine miles north of the city. Miners flow in and out of the area, some working a week on, a week off. “The whole landscape seems to concentrate, giving a feeling of suffocation across the plain,” writes Che Guevara in “The Motorcycle Diaries” (1993), his posthumously published account of traveling through South America in the early 1950s. Underground mining at Chuquicamata began in 2019, chasing deposits depleted by more than a century of extraction. From the highway, I’d passed terraced slag mountains, visible through a dusty haze, a full-scale topography of used-up earth. There used to be a company town just outside the pit with over 20,000 residents but, in the aughts, mainly to comply with pollution regulations, the state-run firm that operates the mine built 3,000 houses in Calama and relocated everyone.

A second-floor balcony that looks out over the museum’s outdoor esplanade and the sea adds to the feeling of openness.

“There was a desire from the beginning to make the museum open to the great spectacle of the changing elements outside,” said Géraldine Lefebvre, the museum’s director.

MuMa, as it is called, has arguably the most important collection of Impressionist paintings in France outside the Musée d’Orsay (Rouen’s Musée des Beaux-Arts makes the same claim). MuMa’s collection is also home to some of the world’s most famous paintings from the Fauvist movement that followed. And unlike the gridlocked Orsay, MuMa is always gloriously undervisited.

“Go to the Orsay, and then come here,” said Ms. Lefebvre. “We battle a little with Rouen, but in terms of the numbers of works and their quality, we are No. 2.”

Ms. Lefebvre has studied and written about Monet’s “Impression, Sunrise.” She worked for a year with Donald Olson, a Texas State University astronomer and physics professor who used topographical, meteorological and astronomical studies to calculate the precise date and time of its creation.

Netflix, too, was heavily involved, with executives testing Kormakur’s methods. The streaming giant financed the extra costs associated with the safety protocols and paid the cast and crews’ salaries when they were shut down.

First, under the system, Kormakur and his entire 80-person cast and crew were tested. Then, each morning, everyone entering the set had their temperature scanned. Catering was turned into individual boxed meals. Doorknobs, toilets and other surfaces were sanitized on the hour. Most everyone except the actors wore masks, and the makeup artists and production designers were gloved. “So much for protecting the environment,” he quipped.

Production has been up and running now for four weeks. And though Kormakur and the other directors filming the series have yet to try a scene involving any close contact or intimacy, it’s continued without incident. (Kormakur says they will address those scenes once restrictions loosen further. If that doesn’t happen in time, they will retest actors before filming them. Iceland is currently reopening in phases.)

Two crew members who went to the set with elevated temperatures wound up testing positive for Covid-19. They were both sent home to self-isolate for two weeks, and no one else became infected.

“Our methods worked,” he added. “We caught two people who in another case would have been working with this virus without knowing it.” He added, “I think if you can create filters in society then you can help find the virus and stop it. Whether it’s film companies or other companies.”

When I spoke with Kormakur, only three Covid-19 patients remained hospitalized in Iceland. Now, Kormakur and the Iceland government are looking at bringing foreign crews into the country to bolster production.

Everything is fine and dandy.’ We have to listen and then we have to respond.”

The fundamentals — high inflation, an uncertain economy, the president’s dismal approval ratings — still favor Republicans, as do the recent shifts to the electoral map because of redistricting. But outrage over abortion rights, the passage in Congress of a series of economic and climate change bills and the continued dominance of Mr. Trump within his party have made some Democrats hopeful that they can triage some of their deepest losses.

Expectations of a so-called red wave have moderated since the spring, with President Biden’s approval rating rising modestly and gas prices falling from record highs. In recent weeks, Democrats have gained a slight advantage in polling, though their lead remains in the margin of error in most surveys.

They hope to make the election not a referendum on the unpopular president but rather a choice between “normal” and “extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic,” as Mr. Biden put it in a prime-time address on Thursday.

It’s a serene sight — except for the one thing Mr. Antezana, a retired oceanographer, cannot ignore. Not far out in the water, a strip of small, rectangular objects stretches across the sea, swaying ever so slightly with the tide. These structures might not seem like much, but Mr. Antezana knows what lies beneath the surface: a salmon farm.

Below the water, high-density net cages teem with thousands of salmon. Farms like this one are common in Los Lagos, the primary aquaculture region in Chile. The South American country is the top exporter of farmed salmon to the United States. But the popular fish are not native to this place, and many environmentalists and activists have long complained that the farms are damaging Chilean ecosystems and threatening native wildlife.

Large-scale salmon farming began in Chile in the 1970s. A young scientist at the time, Mr. Antezana was asked to evaluate the viability of farming the fish. He advised the government to establish base-line studies and to be wary of ecological and health risks.

For more than four decades, Mr. Antezana has watched the industry grow into one of the world’s leading producers of farmed salmon. Last year, farmed salmon was Chile’s second-largest export, generating $6.5 billion in revenue.

It’s an economic success story in which U.S. consumers play a leading role, eating more Chilean salmon than ever before; 2022 was a record year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Most of the farmed salmon eaten in the United States comes from overseas, with almost half from the fjords of Chile.

Its salmon industry has often been criticized for its heavy use of antimicrobials and accused of polluting waterways and contributing to record algal blooms. As primary aquaculture districts have deteriorated alongside the growing international demand, Chilean salmon farming has expanded into the pristine wilderness of the country’s southernmost region, the Magallanes, in Patagonia.",last year farmed salmon chiles secondlargest export generating 65 billion revenue popular fish native place activists long complained farms damaging chilean ecosystems,Chile,,SQM,35.04999923706055,36.38999938964844,35.65999984741211,38.45000076293945,3.823110361643104,-2.00604439263603,1.740372677973045,9.70043252464289

The conclusion that the mine was not going to damage the salmon fishery would be “unequivocal,” he added.

But in public comments on a draft of the environmental impact statement last year, opponents suggested that the review was not so rigorous. They pointed to numerous hazardous risks, including the potential for a tailings dam failure that could contaminate waterways used by spawning fish and harm the Bristol Bay fishery, which employs about 15,000 people.

Alaska is the most seismically active state in the nation, and critics said the Corps of Engineers had not taken sufficient account of the risk of earthquakes or volcanic activity, and that its analysis of the dam designs was inadequate. Some of the dams would be hundreds of feet high.

Tailing dam failures can unleash a sudden flood of contaminated slurry with disastrous effects. A 2019 failure at an iron mine in Brazil, for example, killed more than 250 people. Given the Pebble Mine’s remote location, the risk to people might be low, but the heavy metals and other contaminants could make nearby rivers toxic to fish.",critics say corps engineers taken sufficient account risk earthquakes volcanic activity tailings dam failure could contaminate waterways used spawning fish harm bristol bay fishery,Brazil,,PBR,3.1334176063537598,3.1474061012268066,3.2523200511932373,3.1963655948638916,0.4464293187311461,3.333346463474699,3.794656818113684,2.0089243253912157

The collapse in oil prices brought on by the coronavirus pandemic spells disaster for countries like Nigeria and Venezuela that rely on oil production for their economic survival.

“No one imagined a crisis of this scope. This was in no scenario,” one global energy expert said.

Our reporters looked at the destabilizing effects of the oil-coronavirus shock in countries around the world.

Here are the latest updates on the pandemic as well as updated maps.

Oil prices, which had been sinking since lockdown orders sharply cut demand in late February, reversed some of the tremendous losses of recent days, leading U.S. and European stocks to rally.

Eight infants and toddlers at a care center in Tokyo tested positive for the coronavirus, raising concerns about a wider outbreak at Japanese care facilities for neglected or abused children.

Taiwan is competing with China on pandemic aid diplomacy, promoting itself as a model of democracy, in defiance of Beijing’s efforts to isolate the self-ruled island that it claims as its own.

British lawmakers carried out their normally boisterous question-and-answer session in the House of Commons by video link. Just a few dozen lawmakers sat in the chamber, to comply with social distancing rules.

The first death from the virus in the U.S. was earlier than previously thought. A medical examiner in Santa Clara County, California, said two residents there died of the coronavirus in early and mid-February, weeks earlier than was previously known. (See our Back Story below.)

Financial Challenges, but Abundant Riches

Last year ended with something approaching normalcy for the performing arts after a long crisis. It turns out, though, it was normalcy with an asterisk: The pandemic may be over, but orchestras and opera companies have emerged struggling with ticket sales, and the cost of goods and labor has spiraled; putting on shows is now more expensive, with less revenue coming in to square the books. These financial challenges notwithstanding, there were abundant musical riches in 2023 — as these favorites, in chronological order, make clear.

‘L’Elisir d’Amore’

Revivals of Donizetti chestnuts don’t usually make it onto this kind of list, but the tenderly funny “Elisir” is one of my favorite pieces, and in January, it showed off the best of the Metropolitan Opera. The tenor Javier Camarena, glowing with sincerity, and the gentle yet spunky soprano Golda Schultz, led with spirit by the conductor Michele Gamba, trusted the piece to reach every corner of the vast theater without overstatement or caricature.

The phrase “once in a lifetime” gets thrown around, but really: How often will you get to hear all five of Rachmaninoff’s works for piano and orchestra in a single concert? Let alone with forces on the level of this dazzling pianist and the Philadelphia Orchestra — with all its historical ties to Rachmaninoff — under Yannick Nézet-Séguin, who pulled off the feat at Carnegie Hall in January. A long, giddily virtuosic afternoon. (Read our review.)

Felipe Lara

The New York Philharmonic gave some remarkable concerts this year: I’ll particularly remember the very young (the pianist Yunchan Lim, 19, blazing in, yes, Rachmaninoff) and the very old (Herbert Blomstedt, 95, keenly conducting Ingvar Lidholm and Berlioz). But perhaps most notable was the New York premiere, in March, of Felipe Lara’s 2019 Double Concerto, which made Claire Chase (on many flutes) and Esperanza Spalding (vocalizing while playing double bass) into a seething and exuberant, if not always sunny, organism. My other choices for new works of the year: Kate Soper’s sneakily sagacious chamber opera “The Hunt,” at Miller Theater in October, and Steve Reich’s energetic yet meditative “Jacob’s Ladder,” which the Philharmonic premiered that month.

Johnny Depp and the director Tim Burton teamed for the third time for this 1999 take on the classic Washington Irving story, with Depp’s Ichabod Crane reimagined as a police constable who visits the titular village to investigate a serial-killing Headless Horseman (played by Christopher Walken — that is, in his scenes with a head). Burton unapologetically ladles on the Gothic atmosphere and supernatural overtones, drawing much inspiration from the classic Hammer horror movies of the 1960s, while Depp finds exactly the right note of self-important bluster and barely-concealed cowardice for his Crane.

‘Spaceballs’ (Oct. 31)

In 1987, Mel Brooks focused the satirical laser he had previously aimed at Westerns (“Blazing Saddles”) and horror (“Young Frankenstein”) on the only logical target: the “Star Wars” franchise. The gag-happy writer and director shrewdly spoofs the story beats of George Lucas’s space saga, as Lone Starr (Bill Pullman) and his sidekick, Barf (John Candy), help Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga) battle the evil Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis). But Brooks’s sharpest barbs are saved for the series’s tie-in products, which now play as a prescient prediction of the inescapable ubiquity of blockbuster marketing.

‘The Taking of Pelham 123’ (2009) (Oct. 31)

The mere idea of remaking “The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,” a film so tied to its time and place (the grimy New York City of the mid-1970s), was a big swing, particularly considering how much the city had changed between debuts of the 1974 original and this 2009 remake. The director Tony Scott certainly doesn’t top that picture, but his “Pelham” offers pleasures of its own, particularly from its cast: a typically workmanlike and engaging Denzel Washington; a wildly unhinged John Travolta; and James Gandolfini, proving his range as a meek, ineffectual New York City mayor, a character miles removed from Tony Soprano.

‘Zathura’ (Oct. 31)

The director Jon Favreau started his career making chatty indies like “Swingers” and is now the go-to guy for Marvel (“Iron Man”) and Disney (“The Lion King”). This 2005 family adventure was the bridge he built between those worlds. Based on a 2002 novel by the “Jumanji” author Chris Van Allsburg, it tells a similar story in which children are drawn into the world of a board game that is perhaps too immersive. The special effects are jaw-dropping, and the adventure elements are enthralling (particularly for young audiences), but Favreau’s background in small-scale, character-driven narratives shines through in the sweet and surprisingly moving conclusion.

volcano,Why the Chimera Is the Monster for Our Uncertain Age,2023-02-16,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/t-magazine/chimera-monsters.html,"Japan, Borges, Kingdoms, St. George","MYTHS, WHEN THEY are good, are never static. They stand in a creative relationship to every new time. That potential is perhaps what separates them from mere fantasy. The latter is an efflorescence of the imagination, often an individual imagination; the former is born of a collective imagining, and is hard-wired to be reborn. Every time the world seems to slip from its axis, exposing what feels like the deep solitude of being human, the chimera returns, reminding us that our stewardship of the planet, which has been granted us, either by accident or design, is in jeopardy. The raven-beaked figure of the plague doctor, which was popularized in the mid-16th century by the Italian theatrical form commedia dell’arte, is imbued with something of the lingering terror left in post-medieval Europe by the Black Death. The atomic age in Japan inspired any number of mutants that personify the fear of mutually assured destruction — of which Godzilla, who falls in the category of kaiju, or “strange beasts,” is only the most well traveled. The chimera, as Diel writes, externalizes a certain danger, “in the form of a monster encountered by chance,” that “chimerical enemy” that “every man carries secretly within himself ... the devouring monster.” In the Western conception, the chimera reacquaints us with the double-edged sword of what it means to be human — to be simultaneously magnificent, capable of genius and generosity, and inescapably (if not irredeemably) flawed, greed and self-destructiveness rising up in us like they’re second nature.

Two instances in recent culture capture the uncertainty of our present moment, forcing us to reconsider the locus of the chimerical enemy. The first, following from Borges, is the appearance of dragons in the HBO series “Game of Thrones” and its prequel, “House of the Dragon.” To see the fetishization of dragons in these shows, either as the emblem of royalty — “Dragons will rule the Seven Kingdoms for the next hundred years, just as they did the last,” says the aging King Viserys in “House of the Dragon” — or as the ultimate mark of valor and power is a world away from how Borges encourages us to think of dragons in the Western imagination. Viserys’s son Aemond yearns for a dragon of his own. His taming of Vhagar, among the largest, most powerful dragons alive, provides one of the show’s most thrilling scenes. Here, dragons are terrifying, but in a good way, and certainly not ridiculous. They represent the mystical bond between man and beast but also kingship and its heraldic symbol. These dragons are not awaiting a human slayer, a bumptious avatar of St. George. They are, in fact, much closer to how Borges describes the place of dragons in Chinese myth: “For hundreds of years the Dragon was the symbol of the Empire. The Emperor’s throne was called the Dragon throne, his face, the Dragon visage.” In the “Game of Thrones” universe, men are monsters, and monsters can be redemptive. The chimerical enemy is firmly within humanity, not as an abstraction of human nature but in real human form. The White Walkers, intent on destroying the human race, the show’s Wiki will tell you, are humanoid, “an ancient race of formerly human ice creatures.”",western conception chimera reacquaints us doubledged sword means human chimerical enemy firmly within humanity abstraction human nature real human,Japan,,7203.T,1739.6014404296875,1775.8043212890625,1770.6988525390625,1724.7489013671875,2.0811020281997905,-0.28750176406226574,1.787617059094515,-0.8537897657081368

With Japan’s volcanic landscape, there are ample onsens (geothermal hot springs) in Niseko; taking to the waters at a public bathhouse is both an essential ritual of Japanese culture and part of the ski experience. Join the locals at Yugokorotei, in a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn) in Annupuri. Know the Japanese etiquette, such as bringing your own little “modesty towel” and soap to cleanse thoroughly before dipping, naked (no bathing suits allowed), into a communal outdoor pool. Like most onsen, this one is separated by gender. The outdoor pool, under a wood pergola and surrounded by snow and boulders, features mineral water pumped from the base of Mount Annupuri. It may be cold outside, but you’re relaxing your body and soul in about 130 degree Fahrenheit, mineral-rich bubbling water. Folding and placing the towel on your head is a custom. Cost: 1,000 yen.

9) 6 p.m. The art of noodles

Begin at Karabina, an izakaya occupying a small wooden hut at Annupuri’s base (note: this is the last season the restaurant will be open at this location). Shoes off, walk up a few steps to a cozy alcove, sit around a wood-burning stove and sip a local sake. Then walk a stone’s throw away down a pathway to another rustic wood dwelling, Rakuichi. Helmed by Tatsuru Rai, known for his artisan, local buckwheat noodles, this soba master was celebrated on Anthony Bourdain’s “No Reservations,” and ever since it’s been a hard reservation to get. His wife, Midori, greets diners as they don slippers and sit at a no-frills, 12-seat wooden counter with views of the master at work on a ball of dough. Dinner comes kaiseki-style, a Japanese haute cuisine tasting menu that changes with the seasons. Nine simple dishes with bright flavors are presented on pretty Japanese ceramic plates and lacquer bowls. Order a Hokkaido sake to accompany, for instance, sashimi of sea urchin, toro tuna, smoked scallop and Mr. Rai’s hand-cut soba noodles. Select either cold with tempura vegetables, or hot with duck (an additional 800 yen). Finish with dessert. (Dinner is about 12,000 yen.)

10) 9:30 p.m. Niseko noir

Stop at Toshiro’s for a cocktail created by its bespectacled namesake proprietor and mixologist, celebrated for concoctions like Penicillin, a mix of whiskey, ginger and citrus, with a smoky spin (1,600 yen). Or try a ginger gimlet and a smoked old fashioned with local whiskey.

In one, the club he helps run, Real Mallorca, would remain in Spain’s second division. Its budget would be halved, and difficult decisions would need to be made. Some players might have to be sold. Horizons would be lowered. That was, to borrow a term that has become familiar this last year, the worst-case scenario.

In the alternative — the best case — Real Mallorca would be promoted, back to the bright lights of La Liga. The club’s cash flow would increase, and increase considerably, as television revenue poured in. The team would have to be bolstered, rather than deconstructed. Ambition, though modest, would flutter through the club.

As a director of Mallorca, Le Saux saw the complication. It was, he said, a little like going to NASA and asking it either to put a satellite into orbit or to mount a fully-manned mission to Mars, but refusing to decide which until the day of departure.

This year, of course, things are very different.

“It’s surreal,” said Ingibjorg Olafsdottir, the hotel’s general manager. “It’s completely quiet.”

Since March, even with government support, Ms. Olafsdottir’s staff has shrunk from 140 to just 16. The hotel, which has more than 200 rooms, normally has an occupancy rate of above 75 percent, but it fell to 11 percent in September.

“It’s been emotional,” Ms. Olafsdottir said, adding that, even after cutting down to bare-bones operations, the hotel continues to rack up debt. “But the thing is, I think everybody is in the same boat here.”

Tourism is undergoing an unprecedented downturn all over the world, but several factors make Iceland particularly vulnerable to the industry’s crash: geographic isolation, a small domestic population, strict border measures and an economy that — after an extraordinary, decade-long tourism boom — had come to depend heavily on foreign tourists.

The two presidents, both trained lawyers with poetic sensibilities, forged their identities and their careers in what Mr. Kaplan calls “the crucible of language.” When Mr. Obama was growing up, he remembers, “the very strangeness” of his heritage and the worlds he straddled could make him feel like “a platypus or some imaginary beast,” unsure of where he belonged. But the process of writing, he says, helped him to “integrate all these pieces of myself into something relatively whole” and eventually gave him “a pretty good sense” of who he was — a self-awareness that projected an air of calmness and composure, and would enable him to emerge from the pressure cooker of the White House very much the same nuanced, self-critical writer he was when he wrote “Dreams From My Father” in his early 30s.

Although Mr. Obama says he didn’t have time as president to keep a regular journal, he would jot down accounts of important moments as they transpired. Like the time at a climate summit in Copenhagen, when he and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton crashed a meeting of the leaders of China, Brazil, India and South Africa because they were “avoiding me and a deal we were trying to broker that would, ultimately, many years later, lead to the Paris Accords.” After the meeting, he wrote down what had been said and what the scene felt like — he knew it was a good story.

‘You just have to get started. You just put something down. Because nothing is more terrifying than the blank page.’

Whereas 20 years ago, Mr. Obama says, he would have needed an army of researchers to help him with a presidential memoir, the internet meant he could simply “tap in ‘Obama’ and then the date or the issue, and pull up every contemporaneous article — or my own speeches, or my own schedule, or my own appearances — in an instant.” The actual writing remained a painful process, requiring him to really “work at it” and “grind it out.”

“This is a really important piece of business that I’ve tried to transmit to my girls and anybody who asks me about writing,” he says. “You just have to get started. You just put something down.
